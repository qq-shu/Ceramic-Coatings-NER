Oxidation protective ZrB2–SiC coatings with ferrocene addition on SiC coated graphite,"In order to further improve the oxidation protective ability of (ZrB2–SiC)/SiC coated graphite, ferrocene was introduced into the outer ZrB2–SiC coatings during pack cementation process. The ferrocene addition increased the porosity of the outer ZrB2–SiC coatings, which was favorable to thermal shock resistance of (ZrB2–SiC)/SiC coated specimens. The ZrB2–SiC coating with 3wt% ferrocene (ZS50-3f) has optimum oxidation protective ability. Its weight retention after 15 thermal shock cycles between 1500°C and room temperature was 96. 2%. The weight loss of ZS50-3f was only 0.2% after 19h oxidation at 1500°C.","Wang, Peng;Zhou, Changling;Zhang, Xinghong;Zhao, Guangdong;Xu, Baosheng;Cheng, Yehong;Zhou, Peng;Han, Wenbo",2016-02-01,Ceramics International,"C.

TiO2 optical coating layers for self-cleaning applications,"TiO2 films deposited by various coating techniques were investigated for self-cleaning applications. The optical coating layers of TiO2 films prepared from a sol–gel precursor were deposited on glass substrates using spin coating, dip coating and screen printing techniques. Effects of film deposition techniques on crystal structure, microstructure, thickness, photocatalytic activity, hydrophilicity and optical properties of the films were investigated using XRD, AFM, SEM, surface profilometer, UV–vis spectrophotometer and contact angle measurement. Dip coating the TiO2 optical film two and three times resulted in superhydrophilic surfaces. Increasing number of dipping times was found to increase the photocatalytic activity.","Euvananont, C.;Junin, C.;Inpor, K.;Limthongkul, P.;Thanachayanont, C.",2008-05-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Controllable preparation of alumina nanorods with improved solid electrolyte electrochemical performance,"Alumina powders have been widely used in lithium-ion batteries such as separator coating, electrode surface modification and electrolyte fillers. Rod-like alumina with its special aspect ratio is expected to open up a new application direction. In this work, alumina nanorods were prepared by a facile hydrothermal method. The aspect ratio and morphology of alumina nanorods were optimized by adjusting the hydrothermal temperature, hydrothermal synthesis time, volume ratio, directing agent, and sintering temperature. γ-Al2O3 nanorods with a diameter of 200–300 nm and a mean length of 5 μm and α-Al2O3 with a diameter of 100–200 nm and mean length of 5 μm were obtained by calcining the alumina precursor (AACH) at 800 °C and 1200 °C, respectively. The prepared alumina nanorods were added into polymer solid electrolyte, which promoted the dissociation of the lithium salt and stabilized the propylene polycarbonate (PPC) polymer, resulting in an improved potential window (4.5 V) and ionic conductivity (3.7 × 10−4 S/cm) of the PPC-based polymer solid electrolyte (SE). An NCM622/SE/Li solid-state battery showed enhanced electrochemical performance at ambient temperature with an initial discharge capacity of 188.5 mAh/g and a retention capacity of 158.1 mAh/g after 200 cycles at a current density of 0.5 C. These alumina nanorods have potential to be widely used in high-performance solid electrolytes.","Hu, Xin-yu;Liu, Quan-yao;Jing, Mao-xiang;Chen, Fei;Ju, Bo-wei;Tu, Fei-yue;Shen, Xiang-qian;Qin, Shi-biao",2020-07-31,Ceramics International,"Solid-state battery,Composite solid electrolyte,Alumina nanorods,Ionic conductivity,Li–ion transport,Hydrothermal synthesis",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.178,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.178
The role of a MnO2 functional layer on the surface of Ni-rich cathode materials: Towards enhanced chemical stability on exposure to air,"The severe degradation of Ni-rich cathode materials on exposure to air is a crucial restriction for their large-scale application. To overcome this issue, a MnO2 functional layer has been introduced to the surface of LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 oxide via a wet-chemical method. Compared with pristine sample, the modified LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 shows an enhanced chemical stability because of its low sensitivity to moisture and CO2. The formation of absorbed Li2CO3/LiOH species and spontaneous reduction of Ni3+ to Ni2+ on the surface of MnO2-modified sample have been delayed remarkably, which is confirmed by characterizations of SEM, TEM, XPS and FTIR. Benefit from these merits, the modified LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 displays a specific capacity of 183 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C after air-storage for 40 days, while the pristine sample drops from 195 to 144 mAh g−1 promptly. Meanwhile, the MnO2 layer inhibits the generation of HF and protects the active material against the erosion of electrolyte in the working cell. Therefore, the MnO2 modified LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 after storage shows a capacity retention of 87.1% at 1 C after 100 cycles, which is more stable than that of stored pristine sample (70.3%).","Zhao, Junkai;Wang, Zhixing;Wang, Jiexi;Guo, Huajun;Li, Xinhai;Yan, Guochun;Gui, Weihua;Chen, Ning",2018-08-01,Ceramics International,"Lithium ion battery,Ni-rich cathode materials,LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2,Coating,Storage performance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.166,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.166
Sensitivity analysis and multi-objective optimization of double-ceramic-layers thermal barrier system,"The low residual stress and excellent thermal insulation performance are the two primary performance indicators to evaluate the Double-Ceramic-Layers Thermal Barrier Coating System (DCL-TBCs). Based on the theoretical and numerical models, the sensitivity analysis was utilized to quantify the effect of material properties of the top coating (TC) and geometric parameters on the objective functions discussed above in the present work, and the results show that the thickness ratio and the elastic modulus of TC dominate the influence on the residual stresses in YSZ and TC respectively, and the thermal conductivity of TC has a decisive effect on the overall thermal insulation performance in DCL TC/YSZ systems. Besides, a fast multi-objective optimization method combining back propagation neural network (BPNN) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with constraints (Constrained NSGA-II) has been developed to find the optimal coating structure which can make the residual stresses in ceramic layers and the equivalent thermal conductivity of entire TBCs minimized for various DCL-TBC systems. And the feasible design parameters including the total thickness of two ceramic layers (TH) and the thickness ratio (TR) of YSZ to TH were obtained considering the limitation of YSZ operating temperature and the sintering temperature of the TC. Furthermore, the reference structural parameters were chosen from the optimal solutions by using a typical decision-making TOPSIS method. Finally, the results of sensitivity analysis can also be used to account for the difference in Pareto frontiers of the LZ/YSZ, LaPO4/YSZ and LZ7C3/YSZ DCL-TBC systems.","Chen, Q.;Hu, P.;Pu, J.;Wang, J.H.",2019-10-01,Ceramics International,"DCL-TBCs,Multi-objective optimization,Pareto frontier,Sensitivity analysis",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.278,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.278
Thermo-physical and mechanical properties of Yb2O3 and Sc2O3 co-doped Gd2Zr2O7 ceramics,"Ceramic materials for the thermal barrier coating (TBC) application of Gd2Zr2O7 (GZO), (Gd0.94Yb0.06)2Zr2O7 (GYb0.06Z), (Gd0.925Sc0.075)2Zr2O7 (GSc0.075Z), (Gd0.865Sc0.075Yb0.06)2Zr2O7 (GSc0.075Yb0.06Z), and (Gd0.8Sc0.1Yb0.1)2Zr2O7 (GSc0.1Yb0.1Z) were successfully synthesized by chemical co-precipitation. The effects of the doping of Sc2O3 and Yb2O3 on the phases, thermo-physical and mechanical properties of the ceramics were investigated. The results show that both Yb2O3 and Sc2O3 doping promoted the phase transition of GZO from pyrochlore to fluorite. All the Sc2O3-doped samples exhibited enhanced fracture toughness, as compared to the undoped sample. Furthermore, the GSc0.075Yb0.06Z sample revealed a thermal conductivity of ~0.8 W/mK at 1200 °C, which was nearly 30% lower than that of the undoped sample. The associated mechanisms related to the effects of the doping on the thermophysical and mechanical properties are discussed.","Guo, Yiqian;He, Wenting;Guo, Hongbo",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Gd2Zr2O7,Doping,Fracture toughness,Thermal conductivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.209,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.209
Electrophoretic deposition of titania nanostructured coatings for photodegradation of methylene blue,"The suspensions of titania nanoparticles were prepared in different alcohols (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and butanol) using polyethyleneimine (PEI) as dispersant. The results of sedimentation, conductivity, zeta potential, FTIR and thermal analysis showed that PEI macromolecules are protonated in the suspensions and then adsorbed on the particles enhancing their positive surface charge and so colloidal stability. Optimum concentration of PEI (PEI*) was lower in large molecular size alcohols due to its higher adsorption efficiency. PEI* was 0.75, 0.5, 0.5 and 0.25 g/l in methanolic, ethanolic, isopropanolic and butanolic suspensions, respectively. Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) was performed at 60 V in different alcoholic suspensions. EPD rate was the fastest in the suspensions with PEI* due to the highest mobility of particles. In contrast to the coatings deposited for 1 min from isopropanolic and butanolic suspensions, those deposited at same conditions from methanolic and ethanolic ones severely cracked during drying owing to their higher thickness and lower PEI contents (acting as the binder). The coatings deposited from methanolic and ethanolic suspensions with PEI* had finer and rougher microstructures. The sintered coating deposited at 60 V for 10 s from ethanolic suspension with PEI* had crack-free microstructure with the thickness of ≈ 130 μm. This coating degraded ≈ 24% of methylene blue from its aqueous solution (30 ml with the concentration of 5 mg/l) within 2 h under UV illumination. Photodegradation of MB on the surface of titania coating obeyed the first order kinetics law.","Farrokhi-Rad, Morteza;Mohammadalipour, Mehrdad;Shahrabi, Taghi",2018-06-15,Ceramics International,"Electrophoretic deposition (EPD),Titania nanoparticles,Polyethyleneimine (PEI),Alcohol,Methylene blue (MB),Photocatalyst",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.106,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.106
Dense yttria-stabilized zirconia coatings fabricated by plasma spray-physical vapor deposition,"Plasma spray-physical vapor deposition (PS-PVD) is a novel technique which can offer new opportunities to obtain advanced microstructures. In this study, dense yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) coatings were deposited using PS-PVD with proper parameters. The dependencies of the microstructure of the as-sprayed coatings on axial spray distance and radial position were discussed. Four typical coatings were selected for the current work. The corresponding microstructures, phase compositions and mechanical properties were studied in detail. These as-sprayed coatings had dense lamellar or lamellar/columnar hybrid microstructures, the lowest porosity was 0.44%. Both monoclinic and tetragonal zirconia were detected in the as-sprayed coatings. The distribution of yttrium was not homogeneous, especially in the coatings deposited at shorter spray distance. Furthermore, oxygen got lost partly during the spraying process with decreasing spray distance. The hardness (H) and Young's modulus (E) of the coatings changed simultaneously with the different microstructures. The maximum values of H and E were 16.6±0.6 and 234.3±10.1GPa respectively, which were found in the densest coatings. The dense PS-PVD ceramic coatings might be applicable in anti-corrosion fields (such as alkali corrosion, marine corrosion and hot corrosion).","Shao, Fang;Zhao, Huayu;Liu, Chenguang;Zhong, Xinghua;Zhuang, Yin;Ni, Jinxing;Tao, Shunyan",2017-02-01,Ceramics International,"B.

Microstructure and oxidation protection of borosilicate glass coating prepared by pulse arc discharge deposition for C/C composites,"A borosilicate glass coating for SiC pre-coated carbon/carbon composites (SiC-C/C) was prepared by pulse arc discharge deposition (PADD). Its thickness, compactness and oxidation resistance increases with the rise of deposition voltage from 300 to 400V. The glass coating prepared at a deposition voltage of 400V can protect C/C composites from oxidation in air at 1823K for 156h with a weight loss of 2.13%. The failure mechanism of the borosilicate glass/SiC coatings was investigated.","Jian-Feng, Huang;Yong-Liang, Zhang;Kong-Jun, Zhu;Cui-Yan, Li;Li-Yun, Cao;Lei, Zhou;Hai-Bo, Ouyang;Bo-Ye, Zhang;Wei, Hao;Chun-Yan, Yao",2015-04-30,Ceramics International,"Ceramic matrix composites,Weight loss,Oxidation,Pulse arc discharge deposition",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.12.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.12.012
Novel double-ceramic-layer (La0.8Eu0.2)2Zr2O7/YSZ thermal barrier coatings deposited by plasma spraying,"Pyrochlore-type (La0.8Eu0.2)2Zr2O7 feedstocks prepared by spray drying have been used to produce ceramic thermal barrier coatings. Double-ceramic-layer thermal barrier coatings with a first layer of 8wt% yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and a top layer of (La0.8Eu0.2)2Zr2O7 were deposited by plasma spraying. Plasma sprayed (La0.8Eu0.2)2Zr2O7 coatings are composed of a defect fluorite-type phase and a t-ZrO2 phase. However, after thermal shock tests at 1250°C for 32 cycles, (La0.8Eu0.2)2Zr2O7 coatings exhibit a pyrochlore-type structure. The thermal shock failure of double-ceramic-layer (La0.8Eu0.2)2Zr2O7/YSZ coatings mainly occurs at the interface between the (La0.8Eu0.2)2Zr2O7 and YSZ layers, and is not caused by thermal grown oxide layer from the bond coat.","Liu, Zhan-Guo;Zhang, Wei-Heng;Ouyang, Jia-Hu;Zhou, Yu",2014-08-31,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Plasma spraying,Microstructure,Thermal shock",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.03.159,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.03.159
Synthesis of CsxWO3 nanoparticles and their NIR shielding properties,"A simple two-step route is developed to fabricate hexagonal CsxWO3 nanoparticles. The core of this route is the preparation of the precursor by drying the mixture of WO3 sol and CsCl, which leads to a higher Cs/W (0.32) ratio at low temperature in a short time. During reaction, oleic acid, used as a solvent, can be adsorbed on the surface of CsxWO3 nanoparticles, which results in small particle size (20 nm × 10 nm) and mild agglomeration. In addition, oleic acid also plays a role as a reducing agent in forming CsxWO3 nanoparticles without any further post-treatment. Furthermore, the film prepared from as-synthesized Cs0.32WO3 nanoparticles shows excellent NIR-shielding properties (approximately 99% of the near-infrared radiation is cut off over a wavelength range of 780–2600 nm and the visible-light transmittance at 465 nm is 78.9%) when covering on an ordinary sheet of glass. A model which simulates the real environment is applied to evaluate heat-shielding performance of the Cs0.32WO3 film while comparing with that of ordinary glass and commercial ITO glass (10 Ω □−1). Results revealed that the Cs0.32WO3 film showed superior performance than others.","Yao, Yongji;Zhang, Liangmiao;Chen, Zhang;Cao, Chuanxiang;Gao, Yanfeng;Luo, Hongjie",2018-08-15,Ceramics International,"Near-infrared radiation,Transparent coating,CsxWO3 nanoparticles,Solar filter",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.158,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.158
Ablation resistance of ZrB2–SiC coating prepared by supersonic atmosphere plasma spraying for SiC-coated carbon/carbon composites,"To improve the ablation resistance of carbon/carbon (C/C) composites, ZrB2–SiC coating was prepared on the surface of SiC-coated C/C composites by supersonic atmosphere plasma spraying. Ablation resistance of the coating was investigated by oxyacetylene torch under different heat flux. Results show that the multilayer coating is dense and its thickness is about 60μm. The mass and linear ablation rates of the coated C/C composites are 0.4×10−3 g/s and 0.6μm/s after ablation for 60s under the heat flux of 2400kW/m2. However, the coating is failure after ablation for 60s under the heat flux of 4200kW/m2. The good ablation resistance of the coating under the heat flux of 2400kW/m2 is mainly attributed to the formation of a dense ZrO2–SiO2 scale, which could act as thermal barrier and reduce inward diffusion of oxygen.","Zhang, Yulei;Hu, Zhixiong;Li, Hejun;Ren, Jincui",2014-11-30,Ceramics International,"Carbon/carbon composites,Coating,Supersonic atmosphere plasma spraying,Ablation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.06.064,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.06.064
Porous alumina coatings on carbon-bonded foam filters by electrophoretic deposition,"Carbon-bonded foam-filters, such as alumina-carbon foams, are widely used for the filtration of metal melts. The aim of the experimental investigations reported in this paper was to examine the possibility of producing alumina coatings with a porous structure on such alumina-carbon foams by an electrophoretic deposition method. This method utilizes the simultaneous gas evolution by electrolysis to generate channel-like pores during the formation of ceramic layers by the electrophoretic deposition from aqueous suspensions. The foam samples to be coated were found to possess a sufficiently high electrical conductivity to function as deposition electrode. Using an aqueous suspension of a submicron alumina powder with an anionic polyelectrolyte as dispersant, coatings containing the desired pore channels were successfully produced on these foam samples. Voltages of 10 or 15 V proved suitable for the pore formation, as illustrated by tomographic 2D slices of the coated foams and by images that were taken by means of a digital microscope. First tests showed that the sintered coatings were able to resist the thermal shock to which they were exposed by immersing them into an aluminium melt.","Moritz, Kirsten;Dietze, Christin;Voigt, Claudia;Hubálková, Jana;Aneziris, Christos G.",2019-06-01,Ceramics International,"Electrophoretic deposition,Non-destructive evaluation,Al2O3",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.141,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.141
Microstructure and wear behavior of graphene nanosheets-reinforced zirconia coating,"Zirconia/graphene nanosheets (ZrO2/GNs) composite coatings were prepared using a plasma spraying technique. Microscopic observations showed that the GNs additives (1wt%) were homogeneously distributed in the ZrO2 matrix and most of them were anchored at the splat interface. The results of wear test indicated that the ZrO2/GNs composite coating exhibited excellent wear resistance and low friction coefficient with the addition of GNs. The wear rate of ZrO2/GNs coating reduced to 1.17×10−6 mm3/Nm at 100N, which corresponded to a 50% decrease compared with the pure ZrO2 coating. Interestingly, a GNs-rich transfer layer was observed on the wear track of ZrO2/GNs coating by field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and micro-Raman spectroscopy. This layer protected the ZrO2/GNs composite coatings from severe wear by brittle microfracture, which significantly improved their tribological performance.","Li, Hongqing;Xie, Youtao;Li, Kai;Huang, Liping;Huang, Shansong;Zhao, Bizeng;Zheng, Xuebin",2014-09-30,Ceramics International,"Graphene nanosheets,Plasma spray,Wear behavior,Transfer layer",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.04.136,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.04.136
Improvement in the cycling stability and rate capability of LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathode material via the use of a Ta2O5 coating,"The electrochemical properties of the layered structure LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523) material decrease at an elevated cut-off voltage. The Ta2O5 coating method effectively enhances the surface stability of NCM523. The present study used Ta2O5 as a hydrofluoric acid (HF) barrier material to effectively resist HF attacks on NCM523. The electrochemical properties of Ta2O5-coated NCM523 were enhanced at a normal cut-off voltage of 4.3 V and an elevated cut-off voltage of 4.5 V. With the optimal amount of Ta2O5 coating (1.0 wt%), the capacity retention increased from 91.36% to 97.6% at 3–4.3 V after 210 cycles and from 88% to 92.45% after 210 cycles at 3–4.5 V. The Ta2O5 (1.0 wt%)-coated sample also exhibited a higher rate capability and maintained discharge capacities of 107 mAh g-1 and 125 mAh g-1 over the voltage ranges of 3–4.3 V and 3–4.5 V, respectively, at a current of 5C. The improvement in the electrochemical cycling performance is attributed to the effects of the Ta2O5 coating layer, which mitigates the Mn and Ni dissolution and side reactions caused by HF. The coating layer prevents the active material and the electrolyte from being in direct contact and promotes Li+ transmission. These effects produced a better cycling performance for Ta2O5-coated than the pristine NCM523.","He, Yulin;Li, Ying;Xu, Chaoxiang;Zhu, Mingyuan;Li, Wenxian",2020-07-31,Ceramics International,"Ta2O5 coating,Cycling stability,Rate capability improvement,LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.020,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.020
"Influence of Bi3+ as a sensitizer and SiO2 shell coating as a protecting layer towards the enhancement of red emission in LnVO4: Bi3+, Eu3+ @ SiO2 (Ln=Gd, Y and Gd/Y) powder phosphors for optical display devices","Enhanced red luminescence in LnVO4: Bi3+, Eu3+ @ SiO2 phosphors has been improved mainly in three stages by investigating the effects of: (i) host composition (Gd, Y and Gd/Y), (ii) co-doping Bi3+ as a sensitizer and finally (iii) SiO2 shell coating. XRD data revealed that the produced phosphors possess crystalline, pure phase with tetragonal structure. Silica coating on phosphor particles have been characterized by SEM/EDAX, TEM, PL and with the presence Si–O–Si, Si–O vibrational modes from the FT-IR spectra. Absorption band edges due to VO4 3−, shifted to higher wavelength with Bi-concentration, owing to the presence of Bi–O bond in addition to V–O. The emission intensities of 5D0→7F2 transition are stronger than 5D0→7F1; indicating the lower inversion symmetry near Eu3+, ions. Red emission intensity due to the efficient energy transfer from VO4 3− to Eu3+ via Bi3+ ions in Y0.949VO4: Bi3+ 0.001, Eu3+ 0.05 phosphor was improved significantly, i.e. 1.6 times compared to Y0.95VO4: Eu3+ 0.05. This was further enhanced 2.25 times by SiO2 shell coating.

Wear weight loss was examined by applying different loads over a 9048.96m sliding distance. Experimental results show that the wear resistance of the coated sample reduced the risk of seizure compared to the uncoated sample. An electrochemical test was also performed and the behavior of the substrate in the coated sample was investigated in 3.5% NaCl for 27 days. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) showed that the HVOF coating has high corrosion resistance and protects the substrate from NaCl electrolyte penetration.

Effects of upgrading temperature on electromagnetic shielding properties of three-dimensional graphene/SiBCN/SiC ceramic composites,"SiC coating is introduced using MTS-H2-Ar system via chemical vapor deposition technology. SER and SET of the composites increased from 7.5 dB to 18.9 dB–9.1 dB and 20.8 dB, respectively, due to the deposition of SiC coating. The influence of oxidation temperature on microstructure and electromagnetic interference shielding performance has been systematically investigated. The morphology of GF/SiBCN/SiC composite remained unchanged after oxidation at 900 °C. However, condensed particles which distributed around cauliflower-like structure disappeared and were replaced by some small particles with increasing temperature. The GF/SiBCN/SiC ceramic composites exhibited mass loss after oxidation at 900 °C initially and saw a slight mass gain afterwards.

Effect of TaC and NbC addition on the microstructure and hardness in graded cemented carbides: Simulations and experiments,"By using the gradient sintering process, a tough surface zone in the cemented carbides is usually created to prevent crack propagation from the hard-coating. The microstructure and hardness distribution in the gradient zone are crucial to crack propagation resistance. In the present work, the influence of TaC and NbC contents on the microstructure and hardness distribution in WC–Ti(C,N)–Co-based graded cemented carbides was chosen as the target and systematically studied via a hybrid approach of the simulations and key experiments. Under the guide of the thermodynamic calculation, the cemented carbides with different TaC and NbC addition have been designed and sintered at 1450°C for 2h in an N free atmosphere. The microstructure and concentration distributions were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). Based on the thermodynamic and diffusion databases, the gradient zone formation of the cemented carbides was simulated by DICTRA software. The simulation can reasonably reproduce most of the experimental concentration profiles. Microindentation was used to measure hardness as a function of depth below the surface. On the basis of the simulations and experiments, key microstructural parameters in the hardness model were obtained to predict the hardness distribution in the gradient layer. The relationship among the composition, concentration and hardness distribution can be developed via the present approach.","Zhang, Weibin;Du, Yong;Peng, Yingbiao",2016-01-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Then, ZnO thin films with thicknesses of 50nm, 150nm, 250nm, and 350nm were annealed at 800°C and with thickness of 250nm were annealed at 600°C, 700°C, 800°C, and 900°C, respectively. The effect of film thickness and annealing temperature on the structure and optical properties of sol–gel ZnO thin films on sapphire substrates were investigated by XRD, SEM, RT-PL. All the sol–gel ZnO thin films show polycrystalline hexagonal wurtzite structure and a high preferential c-axis orientation. The XRD and SEM results show that the better structural quality, high c-axis preferred orientation, uniform, compact sol–gel ZnO thin films 250nm thick were obtained when annealed at 700°C in air. Room-temperature PL spectrum of sol–gel ZnO thin films can be divided into the UV emission and the visible broad band emission. The UV emission can be attributed to the near band edge emission (NBE) and the visible broadband emission can be ascribed to the deep level emissions (DLE). The visible emission is suppressed with the annealing temperature of 600–700°C. By analyzing our experimental results, we concluded that the deep-level emission corresponds to oxygen vacancies (V O ). The biggest ratio of the PL intensity of UV emission to that of visible emission (I NBE/I DLE) is observed from sol–gel ZnO thin films 250nm thick annealed at 700°C. Therefore, we suggest that film thickness of 250nm and annealing temperature of 700°C are the most suitable conditions for obtaining high quality, high c-axis preferred orientation, uniform, compact sol–gel ZnO thin films with good luminescence performance.","Cui, Lin;Wang, Gui-Gen;Zhang, Hua-Yu;Sun, Rui;Kuang, Xu-Ping;Han, Jie-Cai",2013-04-30,Ceramics International,"ZnO,Sol–gel,Annealing,X-ray diffraction",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.10.014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.10.014
Molten salt attack on multilayer and functionally-graded YSZ coatings,"Thermal barrier coatings have been extensively studied in the last years in order to increase the operational temperature of the current gas turbines as well as to improve the coating lifetime. Many coating characteristics must be met to achieve these requirements (low thermal conductivity, high thermal fatigue resistance…); therefore, complex systems have been engineered for these purposes. One of the possibilities to optimise the different properties deals with the design of multilayer or functionally-graded coatings where various types of microstructures with different characteristics are combined. One of the most important cause of gas turbines degradation relates to the attack of different type of particles which are suspended in the atmosphere (sand, fly ash…). These solid particles are molten at the operational temperatures and then, the molten salts chemically react with the coating. For this reason, the present research was focused on this type of attack. In the present work, the molten salt attack of various YSZ coatings with multilayer and functionally-graded design was addressed. Two different type of microstructures were specifically combined for this design: the APS coating microstructure obtained from conventional (microstructured) powder and a bimodal structure with nanozones obtained from nanostructured feedstock. Besides, different salts were used to simulate different attack environments (desert sand and volcanic fly ash). Findings show that nanozones act as barrier against the penetration of molten salts toward deeper layer. However, a layer formed by nanozones can detach when the salt attack is too aggressive. Hence, functionally-graded coatings, where two types of microstructures are combined through the whole coating, become ideal to diminish the molten salt attack.","Carpio, Pablo;Salvador, M.

Performance of a ceramic frit anti-oxidation coating on a MgO–C refractory brick,"In steel production, ladles must be preheated to minimize the heat loss of the steel melt, prevent thermal shock of refractory bricks (MgO–C), and to maximize the lining life of ladle. Partial oxidation of MgO–C bricks begins in the graphite bond during the preheating. Oxidation of graphite bond also causes a decrease in performance of the bricks because of an increase in the brick porosity. In this article, coating on a MgO–C brick surface by a ceramic film to protect against carbon oxidation was studied. Coated and un-coated bricks were heated at 1200°C, cooled to room temperature, then the brick properties investigated. The oxidization resistance properties of brick with coating were much better than those without coating, which should lead to longer refractory service life.","Aslanoğlu, Z.",2011-12-31,Ceramics International,"Anti oxidation coating,Ceramic film,MgO–C brick,Oxidation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.05.147,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.05.147
"Water-repellency, ultraviolet protection and infrared emissivity properties of AZO film on polyester fabric","Aluminum doped zinc oxide (AZO) film was deposited onto a polyester fabric by magnetron sputtering. The coated fabric samples were then systematically investigated by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The thickness of the AZO film on fabric samples was also evaluated, as well as the water repellency, ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) and infrared emissivity. The results showed that the AZO coated fabric presented higher water repellency with a contact angle (CA) of 146° and substantial reduction of ultraviolet transmittance with a UPF value of 362. The infrared emissivity of the AZO coated polyester fabric was reduced to 0.916 in comparison to the untreated fabric of 0.979, when the thickness of the AZO coating was 450nm.","Jiang, Shouxiang;Xu, Jiangtao;Miao, Dagang;Peng, Linghui;Shang, Songmin;Zhu, Ping",2017-02-01,Ceramics International,"AZO,Sputter coating,Polyester,CA,UPF,IR emissivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.11.032,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.11.032
"Influence of original powders on the microstructure and properties of thermal barrier coatings deposited by supersonic atmospheric plasma spraying, Part I: Microstructure","In this work, two types of yttria-stabilised zirconia (YSZ) powders, a microsized powder and a reconstituted nanostructured powder, were used as the original feedstock for depositing thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) using a high-efficiency supersonic atmospheric plasma spraying (SAPS) system. The effect of the original powder on the coating microstructure was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The results indicated that the microsized powder was fully melted in the plasma jet and that the as-sprayed conventional coating (named MC) was composed of regular-shaped tetragonal ZrO2 with grain size of 200–500nm. However, the cross-section morphology of the water-quenched powders revealed that the reconstituted nanostructured powder was partially melted during plasma spraying and that the as-sprayed nanostructured coating (named NC) exhibited a multi-modal microstructure that mainly consisted of unmelted nanoparticles (30–50nm) and nanograins (60–110nm), with the latter being the main microstructure of the coating. One visible polycrystalline region consisting of 10nm grains was also found in NC. In addition, due to the full melting of the microsized powder in the plasma jet, MC exhibited a lower porosity and higher microhardness and Weibull modulus compared with those of NC. In the following paper (Part II), the thermo-mechanical properties, such as thermal shock resistance, oxidation resistance and thermal insulation performance, of the above two coating types will be further studied.","Bai, Y.;Tang, J.J.;Qu, Y.M.;Ma, S.Q.;Ding, C.H.;Yang, J.F.;Yu, L.;Han, Z.H.",2013-07-31,Ceramics International,"B.

Influence of thermal stress on material removal of Cf_SiC composite in EDM,"This paper proposes an electrical discharge machining (EDM) for use with carbon-fiber-reinforced silicon carbide (Cf_SiC) composite, which are materials that are extremely difficult to machine. The preliminary machining experiment indicates that EDM is a promising method to fabricate the Cf_SiC composite. However, owing to the distinct material properties of the Cf_SiC composite, the machining characteristics are quite different from those of metal materials in the EDM process, which mainly reflects the difference in the material removal process. To address the above issue, this study investigated the influence of thermal stress on the removal of material during EDM of the Cf_SiC composite. In the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) result, the morphology of the machined surface demonstrates the fracture removal of the carbon fiber with a discharge on the parallel surface and small-area spalling removal on the cross-section of the carbon fiber with a discharge on the vertical surface. In addition, it also exhibits a brittle fracture of the SiC coating and SiC matrix. Furthermore, a novel observation method that can avoid the interference of the discharge plasma by using a distinct band pass filter and laser illumination of a specific wavelength, is employed to investigate the discharge process of the Cf_SiC composite. It further confirms the fracture removal process of the SiC coating and carbon fibers. Finally, a thermal–electric–mechanical coupling simulation is conducted to investigate the stress distribution on the discharge surface of the Cf_SiC composite. It is found that the thermal stress on the machined surface exceeds the tensile strength of the SiC coating, carbon fiber, and SiC matrix. Thus, based on the above results, it is concluded that the thermal stress plays a significant role in high efficiency material removal from the Cf_SiC composite during EDM.","Yue, Xiaoming;Li, Qi;Yang, Xiaodong",2020-04-15,Ceramics International,"Electrical discharge machining (EDM),Cf_SiC composite,Thermal stress,High-speed observation,Heat conduction,Material removal",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.022
In vitro cytotoxicity of monticellite based bioactive ceramic powder synthesized from boron derivative waste,"The cytotoxicity of monticellite based bioactive ceramic powder, which was synthesized from boron derivative waste has been determined by in vitro assays of MTT, NRU, and JC-1 staining. The toxicity of powder on different mammalian cell lines (3T3-L1, HUVEC, CRL-2120) was evaluated at the concentrations of 10, 100, 200, 400 and 800 µg/mL to justify its potential for biomedical applications. The obtained results showed that monticellite based bioactive ceramic powder possesses not only bioactive feature but also biocompatible characteristic at the concentration range of 10–200 µg/mL. Hence, monticellite based bioactive ceramics have high potential as a bone graft substitute for bone void filling and coating applications.","Barutça, Banu;Köroğlu, Levent;Ayas, Erhan;Koparal, A.

CMAS corrosion resistance in high temperature and rainwater environment of double-layer thermal barrier coatings odified by rare earth,"In order to explore the difference of CMAS corrosion resistance in high temperature and rainwater environment of single-layer and double-layer thermal barrier coatings (TBCs), and further reveal the mechanism of CMAS corrosion resistance in above environment of double-layer TBCs modified by rare earth, two TBCs were prepared by air plasma spraying, whose ceramic coating were single-layer ZrO2–Y2O3 (YSZ) and double-layer La2Zr2O7(LZ)/YSZ, respectively. Subsequently, CMAS corrosion resistance tests at 1200 °C and rainwater environment of two TBCs were carried out. Results demonstrate that after high temperature CMAS corrosion for the same time, due to phase transformation, the volume of YSZ ceramic coating in single-layer TBCs shrank and surface cracks formed, which would lead to coating failure. When LZ ceramic coating of double-layer TBCs reacted with CMAS, compact apatite phases and fluorite phases formed, the penetration of CMAS into ceramic coating was inhibited effectively. Raman analysis and calculation results show that both of the surface residual stress of ceramic coating in two TBCs were compressive stress, and the residual stress of ceramic coating in double-layer TBCs were smaller than that of single-layer TBCs. Atomic force microscopy of TBCs after CMAS corrosion show that surface of double-layer TBCs was more uniform and compact than that of single-layer TBCs. The electrochemical properties in simulated rainwater of two TBCs after high temperature CMAS corrosion showed that double-layer TBCs possessed higher free corrosion potential, lower corrosion current and higher polarization resistance than those of single-layer TBCs. Consequently, the presence of LZ ceramic coating effectively improved CMAS corrosion resistance in high temperature and rainwater environment of double-layer TBCs.","Wang, Ran;Dong, Tian-shun;Wang, Hai-dou;Di, Yue-lan;Li, Guo-lu;Feng, Yang",2019-10-01,Ceramics International,"Rare earth modification,Double-layer TBCs,CMAS corrosion,Rainwater environment,Electrochemical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.301,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.301
Electrodeposition of ZnO Nanoprism-Zn substituted hydroxyapatite duplex layer coating for carbon fiber,"A ZnO nanoprism/Zn substituted hydroxyapatite duplex layer (ZnOnp-ZnHA) coating was prepared on carbon fibers (CF) by two-step electrodeposition method. The ZnOnp-ZnHA coating on CF was characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Energy dispersive spectrometer, Raman spectra and Thermogravimetric Analysis. The formation mechanism of the duplex layer coating was discussed. The in-vitro bioactivity of the duplex layer coating was investigated by simulated body fluid (SBF) immersion test. The ZnOnp interlayer showed nanoprism morphology with a length of 0.4–0.9 μm and a diameter of 117–220 nm. We found both the CF and the ZnOnp could serve as nucleation sites for ZnHA layer. The ZnHA outer layer showed ball-like morphology with a diameter of 0.6–1.7 μm. The duplex layer coating exhibited suitable in-vitro bioactivity using SBF immersion test method. The ZnOnp-ZnHA duplex layer coated CF may serve as a promising candidate for clinic applications.","Pei, Lina;Zhang, Boxin;Luo, Hao;Wu, Xiaochen;Li, Gangquan;Sheng, Hongchao;Zhang, Leilei",2019-08-01,Ceramics International, ,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.137,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.137
Thermal shock behavior of a 8YSZ/CoCrAlYTaSi thermal sprayed barrier coating on GH202 superalloy,"The thermal shock behavior of a thermal barrier coating (TBC) prepared by plasma spraying at 1100 °C was investigated. The TBC consisted of a double layer structure of 8YSZ/CoCrAlYTaSi. The morphology, microstructure, phases and the elemental distribution of the TBCs were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA). The characterization results showed that the film consisted primarily of metastable tetragonal phases (t′), and a large number of micro-cracks were present in the 8YSZ crystals. Following eighty-six thermal shock cycles of the specimens a large areal spallation was observed on the 8YSZ coating. The decreased concentration of yttrium at the coating interfaces weakened the inhibition of crystal growth and the phase transition of the Al2O3. The growth of TGO (Thermal growth oxide) and the diffusion into the 8YSZ coating produced deformation and stress in the ceramic coating. Tantalum appeared to absorb the oxygen that diffused into the coatings and delayed the growth of TGO in the interface between the CoCrAlYTaSi and substrate, which was beneficial to prolonging the life of the TBC.","Cao, Jiangdong;Gao, Keke;Cao, Xue yu;Jiang, Bocheng",2020-04-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal shock,8YSZ,CoCrAlYTaSi,Thermal barrier coating,Plasma spraying",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.247,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.247
Preparation and filtration testing of diatomite filtering layer by acid leaching,Ceramic membrane filter consisting of the filtration layer obtained from natural diatomite particles (finer than 50μm) by coating onto a large porosity support made of quartz-based materials was fabricated. The coating was achieved by pressure filtration at 5bar and later sintering applied at 600°C. The sintered product was leached by the hot acid solution (5M HCl; 75°C) for 1h. The characteristic skeletal structure of diatomite (fine microscopic pores) could be obtained without deforming the structural integrity of coating. Filtration response of the filter was tested in dead-end and periodic pressure filtration modes. The filtered particles were of calcite (finer than 1.5μm) obtained from a marble factory wastewater stream. The diatomite leaching increased the filtration capacity of the filter media more than two times. The filtrate has high clarity (0.1 NTU turbidity).

Modification of LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 with a NaAlO2 coating produces a cathode with increased long-term cycling performance at a high voltage cutoff,"A long-lived cycling property is an important factor for the extensive use of the lithium-ion batteries. In this study, a NaAlO2 layer was initially coated on the LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 surface. Electrochemical tests indicate that the coated surface achieves better cycling stability and a higher capacity at 25 °C. In addition, the 1 wt % NaAlO2-coated sample exhibits the best performance, and it also exhibits a discharge specific capacity of 189.6 mAh∙g−1 at 0.1C in the first cycle. After 800 cycles at 1C, the capacity retention of the 1 wt % NaAlO2-coated sample is approximately 73.31%, a value that is 21.26% higher than the pristine sample. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis reveals a decrease in the LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 charge transfer impedance and a significant increase in lithium ion diffusion after the application of the NaAlO2 coating. The high ion diffusion coefficient and low charge transfer impedance are conducive to the better rate performance of NaAlO2-coated LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2.","He, Yulin;Li, Ying;Yao, Nianchun;Li, Jiamei;Li, Wenxian;Wang, Ziqiang",2020-04-15,Ceramics International,"NaAlO2 coating,Long life,Cycling stability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.263,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.263
YSZ thin films deposited by spin-coating for IT-SOFCs,"Dense and crack-free yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) thin films were fabricated using a spin-coating technique for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).

The effect of macro/micro combination pore structure of biphasic calcium phosphate scaffold on bioactivity,"Cellular responses such as adhesion, spreading, growth and proliferation can be altered by macro and micro pores as well as surface patterns on its surface.

Bioactive glass based scaffolds incorporating gelatin/manganese doped mesoporous bioactive glass nanoparticle coating,"We investigated the bioactivity and cytocompatibility of 45S5 bioactive glass (BG) based scaffolds coated with a composite layer formed by gelatin and manganese doped mesoporous bioactive glass nanoparticles (Mn-MBGNs). The scaffolds were prepared using the foam replica method, and they were further coated with Mn-MBGNs/gelatin via dip coating. The synthesized scaffolds were characterized in relation to morphology, porosity, mechanical stability, bioactivity and cell biology behavior using osteoblast-like (MG-63) cells. The scaffolds were highly porous with interconnected porosity, and a suitable pore structure was maintained even after the Mn-MBGNs/gelatin coating. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirmed the presence of Mn-MBGNs in the coatings. Moreover, the presence of gelatin was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The coated scaffolds exhibited in-vitro bioactivity in simulated body fluid comparable to that of uncoated BG scaffolds.

In vitro bioactivity and biocompatibility of a Co–Cr–Mo alloy after heat treatment in contact with different bioactive systems,"As-cast samples of a cobalt base alloy (ASTM F-75) were heat treated in contact with different bioactive materials: (a) powder mixtures of β-tricalcium phosphate (TCP)–bioactive glass (BG) in different proportions (TCP–BG: 60–40, 70–30 and 80–20wt%) and (b) mineral and synthetic wollastonite. Samples were packed with each bioactive material and heat treated for 1h at 1220°C. To characterize the in vitro bioactivity, heat treated samples were immersed in a simulated body fluid. After immersion, a ceramic layer containing Ca and P was formed on all samples.

The more bioactive coatings were selected for MC3T3 cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation assays. Cell proliferation and alkaline phosphatase activity were not affected by the different coatings. Additionally, samples packed with 80TCP–20BG presented a higher cell adhesion than those packed with synthetic wollastonite.

Transparent silica thin films prepared from sodium silicate and bovine serum albumin with petal effect,"A variety of advanced functions such as hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity are required for transparent glass plates recently. This paper reports a new procedure to produce transparent silica thin films on glass plates obtained from sodium silicate as inexpensive silica source by its dip coating and subsequent deposition of silica with (NH4)2SO4 solution. When the thin films were prepared using bovine serum albumin (BSA), the resulting transparent films became more hydrophobic than that obtained without BSA and had good adhesion with water droplet, the so-called “petal effect”. Water droplet on the silica thin film did not slide down even when the substrate turned vertically and upside down. Although no BSA was included in the silica thin film, BSA contributed to the formation of nano-sized asperity structures in the film, producing more hydrophobic (less hydrophilic) property and the petal effect.","Fujiwara, Masahiro;Imura, Tatsuki",2015-07-31,Ceramics International,"Silica,Transparent thin film,Sodium silicate,Bovine serum albumin,Petal effect",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.02.080,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.02.080
Effect of sintering temperature on the microstructure and performance of a ceramic coating obtained by the slurry method,"In this paper, SiO2, Cr2O3, Al2O3, and MgO were used as ceramic aggregates, and a small amount of Al powder was added. A ceramic coating was prepared on a Q235 steel substrate. The effect of the sintering temperature on the coating microstructure, phase structure and wear resistance was studied by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and friction and wear testing. The results show that the tensile strength of the ceramic coating is increased after sintering, the structure becomes dense, and the size of coated micropores is increased to release the internal tensile stress. With the increase of the sintering temperature and tensile stress, the micropores begin to release the excess tensile stress in the form of crack initiation and expansion. The mineralization of MgO, Cr2O3, nMgO and mSiO2 phases can be achieved by sintering the coating at 200 °C; the oxygen in the atmosphere migrates along the micropores in the coating to react with Fe in the steel substrate, forming FeO, and the resulting FeO reacts with the SiO2 in the coating to form the Fe2SiO4 phase. The coating has the best wear resistance after being sintered at 400 °C, and the abrasion resistance of the sample is 6.7 times higher than that of the sample dried at room temperature.","Xiao, Kui;Xue, Wei;Li, Zhaoliang;Wang, Jirui;Li, Xueming;Dong, Chaofang;Wu, Junsheng;Li, Xiaogang;Wei, Dan",2018-07-31,Ceramics International,"Ceramic coating,Sintering temperature,Microstructures,Wear resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.147,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.147
Synthesis and thermal expansion behaviors of spin-coated Sc2Mo3O12 thin films,"Orthorhombic Sc2Mo3O12 films have been successfully prepared via spin coating technique followed by annealing at 500–750 °C. The phase composition, microstructure, morphology and negative thermal behavior of the synthesized Sc2Mo3O12 films were investigated. XRD and XPS analysis indicate that as-deposited film is amorphous. Orthorhombic Sc2Mo3O12 films can be prepared after post-annealing at 500–750 °C for 1 h. The crystallinity of Sc2Mo3O12 films gradually improved with the increase of post-annealing temperature. SEM analysis shows as-deposited film is smooth and compact, and the grain size of Sc2Mo3O12 film grows up as the post-annealing temperature increases. Variable temperature XRD analysis demonstrates that the synthesized orthorhombic Sc2Mo3O12 films show stable thermo-chemical and anisotropic NTE property in 25–700 °C. The corresponding coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) of the orthorhombic Sc2Mo3O12 film in a, b and c directions are −6.68 × 10−6 °C−1, 5.08 × 10−6 °C−1 and −4.76 × 10−6 °C−1, respectively. The whole unit cell of the orthorhombic Sc2Mo3O12 film shrinks and the volumetric CTE of the Sc2Mo3O12 thin film is −6.36 × 10−6 °C−1, and the linear CTE is about −2.12 × 10−6 °C−1 (α v = 3α l ).","Liu, Hongfei;Zhang, Chenjun;Zhang, Zhiping;Meng, Xiangdong;Zeng, Xianghua",2020-10-10,Ceramics International,"Sc2Mo3O12,Sol-gel spin coating,Negative thermal expansion,Thin film",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.046,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.046
The ablation behavior and mechanical property of C/C-SiC-ZrB2 composites fabricated by reactive melt infiltration,"In order to improve the ablation resistance of carbon/carbon (C/C) composites, SiC-ZrB2 di-phase ceramic were introduced by reactive melt infiltration. The ablation properties of these composites were evaluated by oxyacetylene torch with a heat flux of 2.38MW/m2 for 60s. Compared with the pure C/C composites, the C/C-SiC-ZrB2 composites show a significant improvement in the ablation resistance, and the linear and mass ablation rates decreased from 10.28×10−3 mm/s to 6.72×10−3 mm/s and from 3.08×10−3 g/s to 0.61×10−3 g/s, respectively. After ablation test, the flexural strength retentions of the C/C and C/C-SiC-ZrB2 composites near the ablated center region are 39.7% and 81.6%, respectively. The higher strength retention rate of C/C-SiC-ZrB2 composites was attributed to the introduction of SiC-ZrB2 ceramic phases, which have excellent ablation resistant property. During ablation test, an ‘embedding structure’ of Zr-O-Si glass layer was formed, which could act as an effective barrier for oxygen and heat. The oxide ceramic coating could protect the C/C-SiC-ZrB2 composites from further ablation, and thus contribute to retaining the mechanical property of C/C-SiC-ZrB2 composites after ablation.","Liu, Yue;Fu, Qiangang;Wang, Beibei;Liu, Tianyu;Sun, Jia",2017-06-01,Ceramics International,"Ceramic matrix composites,Microstructure,Flexural strength,Reactive melt infiltration",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.02.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.02.008
Comparative study of the hydroxyapatite coatings prepared with/without substrate bias,"The aim of this paper is to prepare the hydroxyapatite by Ion Beam Assisted Deposition and to investigate in terms of its elemental and phase composition, roughness and in vitro corrosion resistance. The coatings were prepared with and without applying bias on substrate, in order to find the effect of bias on the chemical, structural, morphological and anti-corrosive properties. The biased coatings exhibited Ca/P ratio closer to the value of the stoichiometric HAP (1.67). The phase composition is not affected by the bias evolution. The adhesion of both coatings is still satisfactory for biomedical applications, irrespective of the bias. Hydroxyapatite deposited without bias presented the best corrosion resistance in SBF at 37°C, probably due to its smooth surface and low porosity. Moreover, this coating proved to have the highest protection ability at the SBF corrosive attack.","Dudin, Stanislav;Cotrut, Cosmin M.;Dinu, Mihaela;Zykova, Anna;Parau, Anca C.;Yakovin, Stanislav;Vladescu, Alina",2017-12-01,Ceramics International,"A: Films,B: Porosity, X-ray methods,C: Corrosion,D: Apatite,E: Biomedical applications",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.016
Improving hydration resistance of MgO–CaO ceramics by in situ synthesized CaZrO3 coatings prepared using a non-hydrolytic sol,"As refractories, MgO–CaO materials exhibit excellent properties such as high refractoriness and good thermal shock resistance; however, their poor hydration resistance limits their practical applications. In this study, calcium zirconate (CaZrO3) coatings were deposited on CaO and MgO–CaO ceramics by dipping the ceramics in a non-hydrolytic sol. The optimised coating on the MgO–CaO ceramics was prepared by dipping the ceramics once in a 0.6 mol/L zirconia sol. The CaZrO3 coating was in situ synthesized after calcination. The multiphase ceramics with different CaO contents were characterised using scanning electron microscopy to determine the grain sizes of MgO and CaO and to analyse the distribution of CaO in the MgO matrix and the surface porosity of the samples. The microstructure and phase analysis results showed that most of the CaO on the surface transformed into CaZrO3 and was located at the grain boundaries. The MgO–CaO ceramics with the CaZrO3 coatings, especially the ceramics with 20 wt% CaO, showed significantly improved hydration resistance as compared to the untreated ceramics.","Xu, Tingting;Su, Yao;Shi, Tao;Zhang, Xiangdong",2020-09-07,Ceramics International,"MgO–CaO,CaZrO3 coating,Non-hydrolytic sol,Hydration resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.054,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.054
Oxidation resistance and microstructure evolution of ZrB2–SiC–La2O3/SiC dual-layer coating on siliconized graphite at 1800 °C under low air pressures,"The oxidation behaviors of a ZrB2–SiC–La2O3/SiC dual-layer coating on siliconized graphite at 1800 °C under low air pressures (50, 5 and 0.5 kPa) were investigated. The results showed that with the decrease of air pressure, the oxidation kinetics of the coated samples changed from parabolic weight gain to linear weight loss. A protective oxide scale consisted of ZrO2 and SiO2 with La dispersed was formed on the coating surface after oxidation in 50 kPa air. The oxide scale formed in 5 kPa air was full of bubbles. Only porous ZrO2 layer was left on the coating surface after oxidation in 0.5 kPa air. At 1800 °C, the active oxidation of SiC occurred and gaseous SiO formed at the coating/oxide interface. The surface volatilization of SiO became severe with the decrease of air pressure, resulting in the presence of non-protective oxide scale.","Ren, Yan;Qian, Yuhai;Xu, Jingjun;Zuo, Jun;Li, Meishuan",2020-12-01,Ceramics International,"Coating,Oxidation resistance,Graphite,Low pressure air",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.195,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.195
Laser surface modification of porous yttria stabilized zirconia against CMAS degradation,"Here, we present a new combined freeze-casting and laser processing method for the design of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) based thermal-barrier coatings. YSZ ceramics with unidirectionally-aligned pore channels were created using the freeze-casting method. After sintering, top view and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed the structural features of the preform, which exhibits a 74 ± 2% volume fraction of porosity and an average pore channel size of 30 ± 3 μm. The measured thermal conductivity of this porous structure was 0.27 ± 0.02 W/(m K), which is eight times lower than that of reported values for dense YSZ. Though high porosity is beneficial both from a structural and thermal response perspective, the open porosity could potentially be an issue from an application stand-point when evaluating the resistance of materials to calcium–magnesium–aluminum–silicon oxide (CMAS) attack. CMAS attack, which can originate from deposits of molten sand, ash, and dust, is one of the major causes of thermal barrier coating failure. Therefore, the surface of the porous samples was modified using a laser process to create a barrier to CMAS infiltration. SEM micrographs aided in determining the optimum laser parameters required to fully seal the surface using a laser treatment. The performance of the original porous and surface-modified YSZ was compared by conducting CMAS infiltration studies. Laser modification was shown to be a viable technique to significantly reduce CMAS infiltration in porous thermal barrier coatings.","Bakkar, S.;Pantawane, M.V.;Gu, J.J.;Ghoshal, A.;Walock, M.;Murugan, M.;Young, M.L.;Dahotre, N.;Berman, D.;Aouadi, S.M.",2020-04-01,Ceramics International,"Freeze-casting,YSZ,Laser processing,Porous ceramics",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.061,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.061
Structure and properties of nanostructured ceramic matrix composite coatings prepared in-situ by reactive plasma spraying micro-sized Al–Fe2O3–Cr2O3 powders,"Nanostructured FeAl2O4-based ceramic matrix composite coatings were prepared in-situ by reactive plasma spraying micro-sized Al–Fe2O3 and Al–Fe2O3–Cr2O3 powders. The microstructure, toughness, Vickers hardness, and adhesive strength of these coatings were investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and mechanical tests. The results indicated that both the coatings exhibited a nanostructured microstructure. The grains of coating AFC sprayed with Al–Fe2O3–Cr2O3 powders are finer than those of the coating AF sprayed with Al–Fe2O3 powders. The composite nano-coating sprayed with Al–Fe2O3–Cr2O3 powders exhibited higher hardness and better wear resistance compared with those of the composite nano-coating sprayed with Al–Fe2O3 powders. The adhesive strength, toughness, and wear resistance of the composite coating sprayed with Al–Fe2O3–Cr2O3 powders were significantly enhanced compared with those of the composite coating sprayed with Al–Fe2O3 powders, which were attributed to the Cr2O3 addition.","Wang, Lei;Yan, Dianran;Yang, Yong;Dong, Yanchun;Chen, Xueguang;Zhang, Jianxin",2014-06-30,Ceramics International,"C.

Mechanical characteristics of FeAl2O4 and AlFe2O4 spinel phases in coatings – A study combining experimental evaluation and first-principles calculations,"FeAl2O4 and AlFe2O4 have similar spinel structures but different atomic arrangements, leading to different properties. In this study, mechanical properties and structures of the two spinel phases in composite coatings prepared by reactive plasma spraying of Fe2O3-Al composite powder were investigated by means of multi-mode atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. It was demonstrated that AlFe2O4 was stronger than FeAl2O4 with a higher electron work function (EWF). First-principles calculations were conducted to understand the difference in mechanical properties between the two phases. It was shown that FeAl2O4 and AlFe2O4 have “normal” and “inverse” spinel structures with different configurations of valence electrons: Fe2+ tet(Al3+)2O4 and Fe3+ tet(Fe2+Al3+)octO4. Compared to Fe2+ tet(Al3+)2O4, Fe3+ tet(Fe2+Al3+)octO4 has its O and Fe atoms in the octahedral sites forming covalent bonds, which increase the stability and strength of the crystal, corresponding to higher EWF and larger bulk, shear and Young's moduli.","Dong, Yanchun;Lu, Hao;Cui, Juan;Yan, Dianran;Yin, FuXing;Li, DongYang",2017-12-15,Ceramics International,"FeAl2O4,AlFe2O4,First-principles,Electron work function",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.142,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.142
Fabrication of nanostructured ZnO thin film sensor for NO2 monitoring,"Nanocrystalline zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films were deposited onto glass substrates by a spin coating method. These films were characterized for their structural and morphological properties by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The ZnO films are oriented along (101) plane with the hexagonal crystal structure. These films were utilized in NO2 sensors. The dependence of the NO2 response on the operating temperature, NO2 concentration was investigated. The ZnO film showed selectivity for NO2 over H2S compared to NH3 ( S NO 2 / S H 2 S = 3.32 and S NO 2 / S NH 3 = 5.32 ). The maximum gas response of 37.2% was achieved with 78% stability for ZnO films upon exposure of 100ppm NO2 at operating temperature 200°C.","Chougule, M.A.;Sen, Shashwati;Patil, V.B.",2012-05-31,Ceramics International,"ZnO thin films,XRD,AFM,HRTEM,SEM,NO2 sensor",10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.11.036,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.11.036
Temperature-controlled conversion from Fe–Si particles to integrated Fe–Si/SiO2 core–shell structure particles during fluidised bed chemical vapour deposition,"In the synthesis of ferromagnetic/SiO2 core–shell structures, the minimum formation conditions and evolution mechanism are worth investigating. In the present study, to determine the minimum formation temperature of an integrated Fe–Si/SiO2 core–shell structure during chemical vapour deposition in a fluidised bed, the effects of deposition temperature on the structural and magnetic performances of SiO2 insulation coatings on Fe–Si particles were investigated. Thermodynamic calculations and differential scanning calorimetry were used to understand the thermal decomposition of C8H20O4Si. The results of the theoretical and structural studies showed that the minimum deposition temperature of the amorphous SiO2 insulation coating on the Fe–Si particle surface was ~880 K and that the Fe–Si/SiO2 composite structure started to convert into an integrated Fe–Si/SiO2 core–shell structure after the deposition temperature was raised above 920 K. The increase in the thickness of the SiO2 insulation layer due to the increased deposition temperature was studied using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope analyses. The results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that four and five types of electronic structures existed in the SiO2 insulation shell for silicon and oxygen, respectively, and that only 32.74 at.% of the oxygen from the Si(OSi)3(OH) group interacted with the Fe–Si alloy surface. The results of the performance test indicated that the integrated Fe–Si/SiO2 core–shell structure led to a substantial enhancement in the electrical resistivity of the particles and reduction in their saturation magnetisation, but hardly affected the coercive force.","Liu, L.;Liao, X.W.;Jia, J.X.;Kong, H.;Fan, X.A.;Wu, Z.Y.;Wang, X.S.",2020-02-15,Ceramics International,"Core–shell structure,Deposition temperature,Thermodynamic analysis,Fluidised bed CVD",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.006

Synthesis of Ni–TiN composites through ultrasonic pulse electrodeposition with excellent corrosion and wear resistance,"In this study, Ni–TiN composites with excellent corrosion and wear resistance were successfully prefabricated through the ultrasonic pulse electrodeposition (UPED) technique. The microstructure, cross-section composition distribution, microhardness, corrosion and wear resistance of the composites were investigated through atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Vickers microhardness testing, electrochemical workstation utilization and wear testing. Both AFM and HRTEM results indicated that the Ni–TiN composite prepared with the UPED method displayed a fine and compact surface structure, whereas the average diameters of Ni grains and TiN nanoparticles in the composite were 68.4nm and 26.8nm, respectively. The XPS results demonstrated that the concentrations of Ti and Ni in the Ni–TiN composite synthetized through the UPED method were approximately 21.7at% and 47.2at%, respectively. The UPED-deposited Ni–TiN composite displayed the highest microhardness than the other coatings, whereas the average microhardness of the nickel coating was only approximately 486.1 HV. The UPED-deposited Ni–TiN composite displayed the best corrosion resistance, due to the introduction of moderate ultrasonication. The worn surface morphologies of the UPED-deposited Ni–TiN composite were smooth, whereas only a few low-sized scratches appeared on the surface, thereby displaying the best wear resistance in this wear test.","Xia, Fafeng;Jia, Wanchun;Ma, Chunyang;Wang, Jeremy",2018-01-31,Ceramics International,"Ni-TiN composite,Ultrasonic pulse electrodeposition,Synthesis,Microstructure,Corrosion resistance,Wear resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.245,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.245
Tuning magnetic properties of BiFeO3 thin films by controlling Mn doping concentration,"Mn-doped BiFeO3 (BiFe1–xMnxO3, x = 0, 0.03, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20) polycrystalline multiferroic thin films were successfully synthesized using the facile sol-gel spin-coating method. The crystal structures, surface features, elements valences, and magnetic properties of as-prepared samples were systematically explored. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy studies revealed the substitutions of Mn into the Fe site and a rhombohedral-to-orthorhombic phase transition. The Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy showed a decrease in the average particle sizes and an improvement of surface morphology with increasing the concentration of the substitutes. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirmed the doping concentration of Mn2+ in the samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated the co-existence of Mn2+/Mn3+ ions in the doped films. The remnant magnetization value of BiFe0.90Mn0.10O3 thin film was found to be approximately six times than that of pure BiFeO3 thin film under a magnetic field of 10kOe. The enhanced magnetic property of BiFe0.90Mn0.10O3 thin film was mainly ascribed to the structural distortion of spin cycloid and the enhancement of super-exchange interaction between the Fe3+ (Mn2+) and O2- ions.","Zhang, Yilin;Qi, Ji;Wang, Yuhan;Tian, Yu;Zhang, Junkai;Hu, Tingjing;Wei, Maobin;Liu, Yanqing;Yang, Jinghai",2018-04-15,Ceramics International,"BiFeO3,Sol-gel technology,Structural phase transition,Magnetic material",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.230,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.230
High performance porous Si3N4 ceramics prepared by coated pore-forming agent method,"Coated pore-forming agent method (CPFAM) was introduced to improve the pore-forming agent method (PFAM) for the preparation of porous silicon nitride ceramics. Using SEM in combination with measurements of porosity and flexural strength, it has been found that the flexural strength of the porous silicon nitride ceramics produced with the CPFAM method is significantly higher than those without the coating process: a 100% increase in flexural strength for samples with a porosity of 50%. The porous silicon nitride ceramics also have a very low dielectric constant, which is ideal for applications in wave-transmitting systems. The enhanced mechanical strength of the silicon nitride made by the CPFAM method is a result of a more uniform distribution of the spherical pores and the formation of a dense layer of rod-like microstructures near the surface of the pores.","Fangsen, Li;Wancheng, Zhou;Hanjun, Hu;Fa, Luo;Dongmei, Zhu",2009-12-31,Ceramics International,"CPFAM,Porous Si3N4 ceramic,Flexural strength,Dielectric properties,Microstructure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2009.05.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2009.05.007
Efficient suspension plasma spray fabrication of black titanium dioxide coatings with visible light absorption performances,"The present study is a part of continuing research efforts devoted to modifying nano titania by tailoring its structure for enhanced photocatalytic performances. The study concerns suspension plasma spray fabrication of black titanium dioxide coatings with porous microstructures and high photocatalytic activity. The black titania showed composite structure comprising anatase, rutile, metastable brookite, and Ti2O3 with markedly narrowed band gap of 2.71 eV. Further TEM characterization revealed that formation of the black titania was associated with grain growth and with tremendous lattice disorders, which are predominately responsible for visible light absorption. Examination of photocatalytic performances of the black titania coatings showed enhanced absorption and degradation of methylene blue under visible light, giving inspiring insights into surface coating construction of black titania for photocatalytic applications.","Zhai, Mengjiao;Liu, Yi;Huang, Jing;Wang, Yingquan;Chen, Kuan;Fu, Yaoyao;Li, Hua",2019-01-31,Ceramics International,"Suspension plasma spray,Black titanium dioxide,Photocatalytic degradation,Visible light catalysis",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.268,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.268
Synthesis and reaction mechanism of Ti3SiC2 ternary compound by carbothermal reduction of TiO2 and SiO2 powder mixtures,"The present study aims to investigate synthesis of Ti3SiC2 from TiO2 and SiO2 powder mixtures by carbothermal reduction method. Equilibrium TiO2–SiO2–C ternary phase diagram was used to predict the conditions for the formation of Ti3SiC2 at 1800K under Ar atmosphere. A reactant mixture with a TiO2:SiO2 molar ratio of 1.5 and a C content of 68.75mol% (26.86wt%) was initially selected among the thermodynamically favorable reactant compositions for the experimental studies. Two different C sources, graphite flakes and pyrolytic C coating, were used to synthesize Ti3SiC2 at 1800K under Ar atmosphere. When graphite flakes were used, the products contained a trace amount of Ti3SiC2 phase along with major TiC and minor SiC phases. Whereas, pyrolytic C coating on the oxide particles resulted in the products with much higher Ti3SiC2 contents owing to the close contact between the reactants. Optimal C concentration for the C coated oxide mixtures with a TiO2:SiO2 molar ratio of 1.5 was determined to be 30.05wt% under the experimental conditions studied. Ti3SiC2 content of the products obtained from this reactant was observed to increase with reaction time to 31wt% at 75min beyond which it gradually decreased. XRD studies indicated that the product with the highest ternary carbide content also contained TiC and a trace amount of SiC. SEM-EDS analyses showed that this sample essentially consisted of spherical fine TiC particles and Ti3SiC2 nanolaminates. Equilibrium thermodynamic analysis of the TiO2–SiO2–C system suggested that the reaction of solid Ti2O3 with SiO and CO gases may play a dominant role in the formation of Ti3SiC2.","Cetinkaya, Senol;Eroglu, Serafettin",2012-12-31,Ceramics International,"A.

A new sol-gel route to prepare dense Al2O3 thin films,"Anew sol-gel route has been applied to synthetize dense Al2O3thin films from aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OPri)3)as raw precursor material. The results show that, in the solution, acetylacetone (AcAc) and aluminum form a complex compound which effectively suppresses the growth of colloidal particles and makes the sol very stable. Al2O3thin films fabricated by spin-coating method and calcined at 500°C for 3h possess an amorphous structure and exhibit a highly homogeneous surface texture without evidence of holes or cracks throughout the film. Moreover, the prepared films display a low leakage current and a high transmittance. This new sol-gel route appears to be a highly promising method to synthetize dense Al2O3 thin films from Al(OPri)3, and could provide a wide range of optical and electric applications.","Hu, Baofu;Jia, Erguang;Du, Baoli;Yin, Yuehong",2016-11-15,Ceramics International,"Sol-gel,Al2O3 films,Spin-coating,Chelating agent",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.181,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.181
Effect of annealing temperature on the surface properties and photocatalytic efficiencies of Cu2O/CuO structures obtained by thermal oxidation of Cu layer on titanium substrates,"In the present study, cuprous oxide (Cu2O)and cupric oxide (CuO) structures were prepared by thermal oxidation of electroplated copper (Cu) coatings on titanium substrates. The influence of different annealing temperatures from 200 to 600°C on the morphology, crystal structure and the photocatalytic activity of the Cu2O and CuO structures were studied in detail. The photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Photocatalytic activities of the samples were examined by the degradation of methylene blue (MB) under UV light irradiation. The spectroscopic analysis was investigated by UV–vis spectrophotometer. The results showed that the microstructure and surface morphology of the samples changed considerably at different annealing temperatures. The sample annealed at 500°C exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity.

Improved reliability of breakdown voltage measurement of yttrium oxide coatings by plasma spray,"Understanding the dielectric breakdown voltage of coatings inside plasma equipment is important for improving the reliability of semiconductor processes. Measurements of breakdown voltage can vary owing to many factors, but the measurement itself has not yet been studied systematically. In this paper, we designed two type tools to measure the breakdown voltage. We decided to use a one-electrode method with a 20 mm2 electrode and chose to apply the voltage at 15 V/s to minimise measurement error. We used these tools to systematically evaluate the breakdown voltages of different coatings deposited using various methods. Coatings deposited using suspension plasma spraying had a higher breakdown voltage than coatings deposited using atmospheric plasma spraying, because suspension plasma spraying films can be deposited at high density, minimizing electrical stress. As the fluorine content in the coating increased, it is widely used for material of excellent etching resistance in fluorine plasma etching. However, dielectric breakdown voltage decreased with increasing fluorine content, which could affect process reliability.","Song, Je-Boem;Choi, Eunmi;Oh, Seong-Geun;So, Jongho;Lee, Seung-Su;Kim, Jin-Tae;Yun, Ju-Young",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Breakdown voltage,Plasma arcing,Atmospheric plasma spray coating,Suspension plasma spray coating,Anodizing",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.238,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.238
Electrophoretic deposition of hydroxyapatite-chitosan-CNTs nanocomposite coatings,"Three component suspensions of hydroxyapatite (HA), chitosan and CNTs were prepared in ethanol base solution (15vol% water and 0.05vol% acetic acid). The adsorption of HA nanoparticles on CNTs was investigated by FTIR and SEM analysis. It was found that HA nanoparticles are adsorbed on CNTs via chemical bonding between -NH2 groups of chitosan (adsorbed on their surface) and -COOH groups of CNTs. Current density as well as kinetics of EPD was studied at 60V. It was found that current density increases or remains nearly constant during EPD due to the rise in water electrolysis as deposit grows on the substrate. Deposition weight against EPD time showed a linear trend due to the absence of any voltage drop over the deposit during EPD. The incorporation of chitosan and CNTs in the microstructure of coatings was confirmed by TG/DTA and SEM analysis. CNTs exhibited high efficiency in reinforcing the microstructure of coatings and preventing from their cracking. CNTs incorporation in the coatings improved their mechanical properties (adhesion strength, hardness and elastic modulus) and corrosion resistance.","Farrokhi-Rad, M.;Shahrabi, T.;Mahmoodi, S.;Khanmohammadi, Sh.",2017-04-01,Ceramics International,"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs),Chitosan,Electrophoretic deposition (EPD),Ethanol,Hydroxyapatite (HA)",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.139,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.139
Large scale production of spherical WO3 powder with ultrasonic spray pyrolysis assisted by sol–gel method for hydrogen detection,"The spherical WO3 powder was prepared by a facile ultrasonic spray pyrolysis process assisted by a sol–gel method. The thermal analysis of tungsten oxide precipitate indicated that there is 10% weight loss in the temperature range of 25–350°C with two distinct steps, which correspond to the loss of the interlayer water molecules and the coordinated water molecules. The crystal structure and morphology have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results indicate that the XRD peaks for the obtained sample can be indexed to the orthorhombic WO3·H2O and triclinic WO3 with the crystal water being eliminated after heat treatment. The particle size distribution was characterized by laser particle size analyzer and the result shows a double distribution; 50% of the total volume is composed of particles which are smaller than 0.74μm. The d.c. electrical response to hydrogen of the spin-coating thick film sensor has been measured in the temperature range from 200°C to 300°C. The results indicate that the sensor performs as a n-type semiconductor, and it shows the maximum and minimum responses at 200°C and 300°C, respectively, with nearly linear dependence on the hydrogen gas concentration.","Yang, Taisheng;Zhang, Yue;Li, Chen",2014-01-31,Ceramics International,"Gas sensor,Sol–gel,Ultrasonic spray pyrolysis,Sphere powder",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.07.076,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.07.076
Physicochemical and thermo physical characterization of CaO–CaF2–SiO2 and CaO–TiO2–SiO2 based electrode coating for offshore welds,"This paper investigates the physicochemical and thermo-physical properties of CaO–CaF2–SiO2 and CaO–TiO2–SiO2 based electrode coating for welding offshore structures. Twenty-one electrode coating compositions have been formulated using extreme vertices design method. The coating was crushed to powder form.

Relationship analysis on particle-coating-ablation property of UHTC coatings fabricated by plasma spray technique,"The relative high porosity of plasma spray ultra-high temperature ceramic (UHTC) coatings has been an important limiting factor for the ablation property and one of the reasons is the original pores of feedstocks. In this work, dense and spherical ZrC–SiC powders were fabricated by induction plasma spheroidization (IPS) and were used to prepare ZrC–SiC coating by vacuum plasma spray. The effect of microstructure of feedstock particles on the microstructure and ablation property of coating was studied. The results showed that the spherodized particles were composed of eutectic-like phase and ZrC granules, exhibiting high degree of compactness and sphericity, which had higher deposition rate and generated splats with flattened structure to overlap compactly then produce highly dense coating compared with those of spray drying (SD) particles. The deposition rate was doubled and the porosity of the coating was reduced by half. The ablation resistance of ZrC–SiC coating was greatly improved due to the formation of dense oxide scale.","Pan, Xiaohui;Xu, Xueting;Niu, Yaran;Huang, Shansong;Zhong, Xin;Zheng, Wei;Zeng, Yi;Zheng, Xuebin",2020-09-28,Ceramics International,"ZrC coatings,Induction plasma spheroidization,Densification,Ablation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.238,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.238
Degradation of CVD-SiC coated PIP-C/SiC composites exposed to the hot firing test based on MMH/N2O4 bipropellants,Ablation property of CVD-SiC coated PIP-C/SiC composites was investigated by using a hot-firing test in a liquid propellant rocket motor. The effect of the combustion temperature was studied; then ablation mechanisms of coated composites were discussed. The degradation of PIP-C/SiC composites was determined by analyzing surface variations. Two different ablation modes of C/SiC composites were discussed. The coupling effects (thermal–mechanical denudation and thermal–chemical erosion) worsened the degradation of the coated PIP-C/SiC composites.

Oxidation and erosion resistance of multi-layer SiC nanowires reinforced SiC coating prepared by CVD on C/C composites in static and aerodynamic oxidation environments,"A multi-layer SiC nanowires reinforced SiC (SiCnws-SiC) coating was prepared in-situ on carbon/carbon (C/C) composites by three chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes. The microstructure and phase composition of the nanowires fabricated on the first-layer SiCnws-SiC coating and the coatings were examined by SEM, TEM, and XRD. The bamboo-like SiC nanowires with a 50 nm diameter and a length of several tens of micrometers are straight, randomly orientated and distributed like a net on the first-layer SiCnws-SiC coating. The growth direction is [111], and the growth mechanism is VS. The multi-layer SiCnws-SiC coating has three layers: the thickness of the first-layer is roughly 400 µm, and the outer two layers are about 200 µm. Each layer has a sandwich structure. The isothermal oxidation and erosion resistance of the multi-layer SiCnws-SiC coating were investigated in an electrical furnace and a high temperature wind tunnel. The results indicated that the weight loss of the multi-layer SiCnws-SiC coated C/C composites was only 1.8% after oxidation in static air at 1773 K for 361 h. Further, the coated sample failed due to fracture of the coating at the clamping position (i.e. 80 mm) after erosion at 1873 K for 130 h in the wind tunnel. The weight loss of the coated C/C composites occurred due to the formation of penetrating cracks in the coating during the oxidation thermal shock. The maximum bending moment and the larger clamping force caused the coating fracture and resulted in intense oxidation of the substrate and the failure of the specimen.","Qiang, Xinfa;Li, Hejun;Liu, Yunfan;Zhang, Nan;Li, Xin;Tian, Song;Cong, Yuan",2018-10-01,Ceramics International,"CVD,SiC nanowires,SiC coating,Microstructure,Oxidation,Erosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.005
The hydrophobicity and optical properties of the HfO2-deposited glass,"The HfO2 thin film was deposited on the glass substrate by physical vapor deposition and exhibited good surface flatness. The coating had smaller grain size with increasing RF power. A control of lower oxidation state of Hf (Hf2+) is a way to enhance the hydrophobicity of the HfO2-deposited glass. The nonlinear refractive index of HfO2 film on the glass substrate was measured by Moiré deflectometry, and was of the order of 10–8 cm2 W–1. As the RF power increased, the transparent HfO2-deposited glass showed a blue-shift and lower transmission in the near-IR region. On comparing with the pure glass, the HfO2-deposited glass exhibited hydrophobicity and had optical selection in the Vis–IR region for improving optical application.","Lin, Su-Shia;Liao, Chung-Sheng",2013-01-31,Ceramics International,"Film,Power,Hydrophobicity,Transmission",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.06.033,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.06.033
Effect of V-addition on the thermal stability and oxidation resistance of CrAlN coatings,"Since the superiority of tribological properties, V-containing coatings, with the potential to generate lubricious Magnéli oxides at elevated temperatures, are regarded as excellent candidates for machining applications. Here, a study was conducted to shed light on the intrinsic thermal stability, mechanical properties and oxidation resistance of V-alloyed CrAlN coatings deposited by cathode arc evaporation. The hardness of Cr0.48Al0.52N and Cr0.44Al0.50V0.06N coatings with a single-phase face-centered cubic structure is 30.8 ± 0.9 and 33.0 ± 1.3GPa, respectively. Upon annealing in Ar atmosphere, Cr0.44Al0.50V0.06N coating reveals a retarded precipitation of wurtzite AlN as well as a postponement in Cr–N disintegration as compared to V-free Cr0.48Al0.52N coating, owing to the solid solution of V with a stronger binding capacity with nitrogen. The improved structural stability of Cr0.44Al0.50V0.06N coating contributes to the mild decline in hardness and elastic modulus upon annealing. When exposed to air, the incorporation of V into CrAlN promotes the formation of (Al, Cr)2O3 mixed oxide as well as additional V2O5, leading to a significantly lower onset temperature for oxidation. The existence of V2O5 degrades the protective of (Al, Cr)2O3 oxide layer and causes a complete oxidation of Cr0.44Al0.50V0.06N coating at 950°C, where only a dense and thin oxide scale can be detected in Cr0.48Al0.52N coating.","Xu, Yu X.;Hu, Chun;Chen, Li;Pei, Fei;Du, Yong",2018-04-15,Ceramics International,"Films,CrAlVN,Hardness,Thermal properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.135,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.135
Sol–gel derived PMN–PT thick films for high frequency ultrasound linear array applications,"A 12-µm PMN–PT [0.65Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3–0.35PbTiO3] thick film was produced by alternate spin-coating of a ceramic powder/sol–gel composite and infiltration of the sol–gel. Using this technique, a high quality PMN–PT thick film was obtained, showing a permittivity ε r of ~3300 and dielectric loss factor of ~0.02 at 1kHz. Photolithographic and wet etching techniques were used to fabricate a 32-element linear array from the film. The completed array showed a center frequency of approximately 110MHz and a bandwidth of 60% at −6dB without a matching layer. The performance of the kerfless array was studied and compared to a kerfed array simulated with finite element analysis.","Zhu, B.P.;Wu, D.W.;Zhang, Y.;Ou-Yang, J.;Chen, S.;Yang, X.F.",2013-12-31,Ceramics International,"PMN–PT thick film,High frequency,Kerfless linear array",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.04.054,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.04.054
Properties of calcium phosphates ceramic composites derived from natural materials,"In this study, ceramics containing mixed phases of hydroxyapatite/beta-tricalcium phosphate (HA/β-TCP) were fabricated by a solid-state reaction technique. The HA powder was synthesized from cockle shells while the β-TCP powder was synthesized from egg shells. Pure HA and β-TCP fine powders were successfully obtained. The HA and β-TCP were mixed and subjected to a thermal treatment up to 1100°C. To form the mixed phase ceramics, the resulting powders were sintered at 1350°C. Effects of HA concentration on the properties of the studied ceramic were investigated. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that all samples presented multiphase of calcium phosphate compounds. Average grain size of the ceramics decreased with the HA additive content. The 75wt% HA ceramic showed the maximum hardness value (5.5GPa) which is high when compared with many calcium phosphate ceramics. In vitro bioactivity test indicated that apatite forming increased with the HA additive content. To increase antibacterial activity, selected ceramics were coated with AgNO3. Antibacterial test suggested that an Ag compound coating on the ceramics could improve the antibacterial ability of the studied ceramics. In addition, the antibacterial ability for the Ag coated ceramics depended on the porosity of the ceramics.","Lertcumfu, N.;Jaita, P.;Manotham, S.;Jarupoom, P.;Eitssayeam, S.;Pengpat, K.;Rujijanagul, G.",2016-07-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Ammonium polyacrylate adsorption on “aluminium hydroxides and oxyhydroxide” coated silicon nitride powders,"Si3N4 powders coated with pseudoboehmite, Al hydroxide with a OH/Al mol ratio (R) lower than 3 and bayerite, were prepared from different coating solutions and dispersed in water with an ammonium polyacrylate (NH4PA) to produce 11.8 vol% slips. The coated powders showed isoelectric points at pH 7, 7.5 and 7.5 close to that of the precipitate coatings of pseudoboehmite, Al hydroxide (R<3) and bayerite, respectively, indicating that the surface coverages were almost complete. The bayerite coated powders had the lowest specific surface area values. The coatings on Si3N4 particles were shown to improve the adsorption of NH4PA dispersant on Si3N4. The maximum adsorption of the polyelectrolyte at pH 9.5 increased from 0.01 for the uncoated powder to 0.03, 0.055 and 0.08 mg/m2 for the coated powders with pseudoboehmite, Al hydroxide (R<3) and bayerite, respectively.","Albano, Marı́a P.;Garrido, Liliana B.;Garcia, Ana B.",2000-06-16,Ceramics International,"D.

"Biocompatibility, corrosion resistance and antibacterial activity of TiO2/CuO coating on titanium","In this work, TiO2/CuO coating was prepared on titanium (Ti) by combination of magnetron sputtering and annealing treatment. The microstructure, biocompatibility, corrosion resistance and antibacterial property of TiO2/CuO coating were investigated in comparison with pure Ti and TiO2 coating. The results show that TiO2/CuO coating is mainly composed of TiO2 and CuO. In vitro cytocompatibility evaluation suggests that no obvious toxicity appears on the TiO2/CuO coating, and the coating stimulates the osteoblast spreading and proliferation. Compared with Ti and TiO2 coating, TiO2/CuO coating exhibits improved corrosion resistance and antibacterial ability against S.aureus. This study is the first attempt to apply the combination of magnetron sputtering and annealing treatment to introduce the Cu into TiO2 coating for surface modification of Ti-based implant materials, which may provide a research foundation for further development of bioactive multifunctional coatings to meet the better clinical demand.","He, Xiaojing;Zhang, Guannan;Wang, Xin;Hang, Ruiqiang;Huang, Xiaobo;Qin, Lin;Tang, Bin;Zhang, Xiangyu",2017-12-15,Ceramics International,"Implant materials,TiO2/CuO coating,Biocompatibility,Corrosion resistance,Antibacterial property",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.196,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.196
Microstructure and ablation behavior of double anti-oxidation protection for carbon-bonded carbon fiber composites,"To improve the oxidation protective ability of carbon–bonded carbon fiber (CBCF) composites, double anti-oxidation protection for CBCF composites were prepared, i.e., ceramic coating-coated CBCF composites combined with ceramic-modified carbon fiber in CBCF matrix. The ablation behavior of modified CBCF composites was tested under an oxyacetylene flame at 1600°C for 300s and 800s, respectively. The results indicate that the ZrB2 in matrix and ZrB2-based ceramic coating can play double protection for CBCF composites during ablation process. The linear ablation rate of the sample after ablation for 300s and 800s were −1.1×10−4 and 8.38×10−4 cms−1, respectively. The modified CBCF composites presented excellent oxidation resistance for 300s. With the increase of the oxidation time for 800s, the ZrB2-based ceramic coating experienced catastrophic damage. However, the carbon fiber surface only exhibited some circular pits instead of complete oxidation, implying that the ZrB2 on the carbon fiber surface improved the anti-oxidation and ablation resistance of CBCF composites.","Xu, Baosheng;An, Yumin;Wang, Peng;Jin, Xinxin;Zhao, Guangdong",2017-01-31,Ceramics International,"Carbon-bonded carbon fiber composites,Ceramic coating,Oxidation resistance,Ablation behavior",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.009
Combined effect of heat treatment and sealing on the corrosion resistance of reactive plasma sprayed TiNx/TiOy coatings,"A titanium nitride/titanium oxide composite coating was deposited on a Q235 steel substrate by reactive plasma spraying (RPS). The microstructure and phases of the coatings were analysed by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The corrosion performance of the coatings was evaluated through electrochemical measurements. The as-sprayed coating is composed of TiN, TiN0.3, and Ti3O phases. Ti2O and TiO2 were generated after heat treatment at 300 and 400 °C, respectively. Heat treatment reduced the porosity of the coating. Sealing the coating before and after the heat treatment led to improved corrosion resistance. The coating heat-treated at 300 °C and then sealed had the lowest porosity (0.8%), with a reduction in porosity of 55.6% compared to that of a sealed as-sprayed coating (1.8%). The corrosion current density and corrosion potential of the sealed as-sprayed coating were found to be 6.03 × 10−7 A/cm2 and −0.47 V, respectively, whereas the coating heat-treated at 300 °C and then sealed had the lowest corrosion current density (1.8 × 10−8 A/cm2) and the highest corrosion potential (−0.19 V). Thus, the results indicate that sealed heat-treated coatings have much better corrosion resistance than the sealed as-sprayed coating.","Zhang, Yu;Wang, Zehua;Shi, Ying;Shao, Yanfan;Gu, Chenyu",2019-12-15,Ceramics International,"Reactive plasma spraying,Titanium nitride coating,Heat treatment,Corrosion resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.182,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.182
Preparation and characterization of alumina-coated silicon carbide supports,"Porous ceramic membranes have attracted research interest because of their high thermal and chemical stabilities. Recently, silicon carbide membranes have been fabricated. However, insufficient data exist regarding the microfiltration applications of silicon carbide supports. We compared the measured membrane properties of alumina-coated silicon carbide and pyrophyllite supports. The experimental data were used to determine whether the average pore size of a silicon carbide support could be effectively reduced while maintaining acceptable water permeability by controlling the thickness of the alumina coating via a multiple dip-coating method. The membrane properties of the alumina-coated silicon carbide supports were examined using scanning electron microscopy, mercury porosimetry, and a dead-end microfiltration system.","Ha, Jang-Hoon;Lee, Sujin;Abbas Bukhari, Syed Zaighum;Choi, Jae Ryung;Lee, Jongman;Song, In-Hyuck;Lee, Seung Jun;Choi, Jaeho",2017-08-15,Ceramics International,"Alumina coating,Alumina support layer,Silicon carbide support,Pore characteristics,Microfiltration",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.126,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.126
Phase stability and hot corrosion behavior of ZrO2–Ta2O5 compound in Na2SO4–V2O5 mixtures at elevated temperatures,"For thermal barrier coating (TBC) applications, yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is susceptible to hot corrosion. This paper examines the hot corrosion performance of ZrO2/Ta2O5 compounds. Different compositions of ZrO2–Ta2O5 samples in the presence of molten mixture of Na2SO4+V2O5 at 1100°C were tested. The compositions were selected to form tetragonal and orthorhombic phases of zirconium-tantalum oxides. Results show that orthorhombic zirconium-tantalum oxide is more stable, both thermally and chemically in Na2SO4+V2O5 media at 1100°C, and shows a better hot corrosion resistance than the tetragonal phase.","Habibi, M.H.;Yang, Shizhong;Guo, S.M.",2014-04-30,Ceramics International,"C.

Effect of temperature on the growth of boron nitride interfacial coatings on SiC fibers by chemical vapor infiltration,"In order to improve bonding property between SiC fibers and matrix of SiCf/SiC composites, boron nitride (BN) interfacial coatings were synthesized by chemical vapor infiltration. BN coatings were fabricated from BCl3–NH3 gaseous mixtures at four different temperatures (843 °C, 900 °C, 950 °C and 1050 °C) with different deposition times. Growth kinetics, nucleation and growth processes, microstructure and chemical composition of boron nitride coatings were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectrometry. Results showed that deposition rate increased as the temperature increased from 843 °C to 950 °C. However, deposition rate decreased slightly from 23.10 ± 0.85 nm/min (950 °C) to 21.39 ± 0.67 nm/min when the temperature was increased further to 1050 °C. It could be due to the nucleation occurring in the gas and the consumption of a large amount of BCl3 and NH3. When deposition temperature was 843 °C, BN grains deposited on top layer of the coating could not completely cross Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier and grew in island growth mode. On the other hand, the deposition pattern followed a layer-by-layer growth mode when deposition temperature was 1050 °C. Deposition temperature significantly affected the microstructure of as-deposited BN coatings. At 843 °C, 950 °C and 1050 °C, the coatings presented amorphous, polycrystalline and hexagonal structures, respectively.","Dai, Jianwei;Wang, Yiguang;Xu, Zhenhua;Mu, Rende;He, Limin",2019-10-15,Ceramics International,"Hexagonal boron nitride,SiC fibers,Chemical vapor infiltration,Growth kinetics,Growth mode",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.077,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.077
Properties and residual stress distribution of plasma sprayed magnesia stabilized zirconia thermal barrier coatings,"Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are employed to protect hot section components in industrial and aerospace gas turbine engines. Conventional TBCs frequently fail due to high residual stresses generated within the coating systems owing to the difference between coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the substrate & deposited layers. Functionally graded-thermal barrier coatings (FG-TBCs) with gradual variation in composition and microstructure have been proposed to minimize the problem. In the present study, three different TBC systems, one duplex and two FG-TBCs, having three and five layers, respectively, were prepared by atmospheric plasma spray (APS) process on Nimonic 90 substrates using Ni-5Al as bond coat (BC) and magnesia stabilized zirconia as top coat (TC) materials. Five layers comprising the three TBC systems were also deposited separately as individual coatings to study their characteristic properties. The coatings were characterized by a scanning electron microscope. Microhardness and CTE of the individual coatings were also measured. Finite element analysis (FEA) using ANSYS 14.5 was performed to estimate the thermal residual stresses generated within the as-sprayed coating systems. The microstructure, microhardness and CTE in the five-layer FG-TBC changed gradually as compared with duplex and three-layer FG-TBC. The lowest radial, axial and shear stresses were generated in the five-layer FG-TBC compared with those of the duplex and three-layer FG-TBC. Increasing the number of layers with a gradient in composition from BC to TC having similar thickness of coatings increased the bond strength of the FG-TBCs. The bond strength of five-layer FG-TBC was found to be almost 1.5 times as high as that of the duplex TBC.","Baig, M.N.;Khalid, F.A.;Khan, F.N.;Rehman, K.",2014-04-30,Ceramics International,"Ni-5Al bond coat,Magnesia stabilized zirconia,Plasma spraying,Finite element analysis",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.09.035,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.09.035
Interaction between Y-Al-Si-O glass-ceramics for environmental barrier coating materials and Ca-Mg-Al-Si-O melts,"Y2O3-Al2O3-SiO2 (Y-Al-Si-O, YAS) glass is a highly promising material offering resistance against calcium magnesium aluminosilicate (Ca-Mg-Al-Si-O, CMAS) corrosion, and it is an excellent candidate for environmental barrier coating (EBC). In this study, influence of composition on YAS glass properties and CMAS corrosion resistance at 1300 °C was investigated, and the result indicated that most sets of YAS glass possessed the superior CMAS resistance than yttrium disilicate. The increase of Y2O3 content and decrease of Al/Si ratio both resulted in a higher nucleation rate during heating. Moreover, when YAS was subjected to the molten CMAS corrosion, two types of corrosion restraining behaviors were observed. One is the generation of anorthite layer on YAS with high-optical basicity, and the recession depth becomes less than that of yttrium disilicate. Stacking of anorthite grains obstructs the diffusion of Y to the corrosion front, which inhibits the corrosion. The other mechanism involves the generation of calcium yttrium cyclosilicate layer at ~1270 °C first on YAS with low-optical basicity. Next, with the increase in the temperature, the reaction changes to generate an amorphous phase. Moreover, the layer acts as a barrier to restrain the corrosion. Furthermore, the difference between the two corrosion behaviors was explained based on the optical basicity (OB) theory calculation, and a YAS composition region with excellent resistance toward CMAS corrosion was predicted. The region with an OB higher than that of CMAS shows superior CMAS resistance, in particular, for the portion with a lower difference in values of OB between the two substances.","Deng, Juanli;Lu, Baofu;Hu, Kaiyue;Li, Hao;Wang, Jiahao;Fan, Shangwu;Zhang, Litong;Cheng, Laifei",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"Y-Al-Si-O,Glass-ceramic,CMAS,Environmental barrier coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.037,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.037
Improved fracture toughness and multiple toughening mechanisms of NdPO4/NdYbZr2O7 composites,"The low fracture toughness of NdYbZr2O7 limits its application as a novel thermal barrier coating (TBC) material. In the present work, NdPO4 was selected to toughen NdYbZr2O7 and the NdPO4/NdYbZr2O7 composites were synthesized by solid-state reaction sintering. Microstructures, fracture toughness and associated toughening mechanisms of the composites were investigated. The fracture toughness of the composite with 20 mol% NdPO4 was ~1.6 MPa m1/2, nearly 25% higher than that of NdYbZr2O7 ceramic. With the addition of NdPO4, the fracture mode transformed from intragranular fracture to a mixed mode of transgranular fracture and intergranular fracture. Besides, several crack propagation paths such as crack bridging, deflection and bifurcation were observed in the NdPO4 grains, indicative of enhanced fracture toughness. Compressive stress in the NdYbZr2O7 matrix, weak NdPO4/NdYbZr2O7 interface and tensile stress in the layered NdPO4 second phase are responsible for the improvement of fracture toughness.","Wu, Yang;He, Wenting;Guo, Hongbo",2020-07-31,Ceramics International,"Fracture toughness,Toughening,Composites,Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs)",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.234,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.234
Microstructure and anti-ablation performance of HfC-TaC and HfC-ZrC coatings synthesized by CVD on C/C composites,"HfC-TaC and HfC-ZrC biphase coatings were synthesized on C/C composites through CVD technique with the aim of elevating the anti-ablation performance of the HfC monophase coating. The phase composition, microstructure and anti-ablation performance of the biphase coatings were researched, as well as the ablation mechanism of the coated C/C samples. Results manifested that both the HfC-TaC and HfC-ZrC coatings exhibited a compact and particle-stacked structure and combined well with the C/C substrate. Incorporating TaC is capable of enhancing the anti-ablation performance of the HfC coating by reason of forming the stable Hf6Ta2O17 phase during ablation. The evaporation and mechanical denudation of the Hf-Ta-O glassy film leaded to the HfC-TaC coating exfoliation. In comparison to the HfC and HfC-TaC coatings, the HfC-ZrC coating exhibited superior anti-ablation performance on account of the solid solution sintering between the HfO2 and ZrO2 particles and the good anti-scour performance of the oxide layer. After exposure to oxyacetylene torch for 120 s, the mass and linear ablation rates of the HfC-ZrC-coated C/C sample were only 0.63 mg/s and 0.21 μm/s, respectively.","Ren, Jincui;Feng, Errong;Zhang, Yulei;Zhang, Jian;Li, Lu",2020-06-01,Ceramics International,"C/C composites,Biphase coating,Chemical vapor deposition,Microstructure,Anti-ablation performance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.006
Effect of HfB2 and WC additives on the ablation resistance of ZrB2–SiC composite coating manufactured by SPS,"ZrB2–SiC composite coating with HfB2-WC as additives was successfully manufactured on graphite substrate by spark plasma sintering method. The effect of HfB2 and WC on coating properties was investigated. The microstructure, phase changes and ablation resistance of the coatings were studied. Results showed that composite coatings with the thickness of 500 μm and penetration depth of 250 μm were obtained for all samples. Results of the oxyacetylene flame test showed that the ablation resistance of the coated graphite was significantly increased. The minimum ablation weight percentage and rate of 2% and 3 mg s−1 were obtained for the composite coating with 3.75% of each additive.","Akbarpour Shalmani, S.

Effect of Mo on tribological behaviors of atmospheric plasma sprayed Al2O3-13%TiO2/Mo coatings under boundary lubrication condition,"The role of Mo alloy element on the tribological behaviors of AT13/Mo coatings sliding against Si3N4 balls under boundary lubrication condition was investigated. The results revealed that the AT13 and AT13/Mo coatings were mainly composed of γ-Al2O3, α-Al2O3 and TixOy ceramic phases and both coatings underwent a transition from boundary lubrication to dry friction. Furthermore, the addition of Mo could greatly reduce friction. Moreover, the tribological properties of AT13/Mo coating under boundary lubrication condition were superior over those of pure AT13 coatings. According to XPS results, Mo has undergone a chemical reaction to generate a tribofilm covering the friction interface under boundary lubrication condition, and the film containing MoS2 and MoO2 can greatly enhance load-bearing capability and provide good boundary lubrication effect.","Zhang, Chao;Huang, Bo;Xu, Jinyong;Cao, Wenjian;Sun, Guodong;Xiao, Jinkun;Yin, Shuo",2020-07-31,Ceramics International,"Atmospheric plasma spray,Coatings,Tribological performance,Boundary lubrication,Tribofilm",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.041,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.041
Nanolayer CrAlN/TiSiN coating designed for tribological applications,"With the goal to produce a hard and tough coating intended for tribological applications, CrAlN/TiSiN nanolayer coating was prepared by alternative deposition of CrAlN and TiSiN layers. In the first part of the article, a detailed study of phase composition, microstructure, and layer structure of CrAlN/TiSiN coating is presented. In the second part, its mechanical properties, fracture and tribological behavior are compared to the nanocomposite TiSiN coating. An industrial magnetron sputtering unit was used for coating deposition. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy were used for compositional and microstructural analysis. Mechanical properties and fracture behavior were studied by instrumented indentation and focused ion beam techniques. Tribological properties were evaluated by ball-on-disk test in a linear reciprocal mode. A complex layer structure was found in the nanolayer coating. The TiSiN layers were epitaxially stabilized inside the coating which led to formation of dislocations at interfaces, to introduction of disturbances in the coating growth, and as a result, to development of fine-grained columnar microstructure. Indentation load required for the onset of fracture was twice lower for the nanolayer CrAlN/TiSiN, compared to the nanocomposite TiSiN coating. This agrees very well with their mechanical properties, with H3/E2 being twice higher for the TiSiN coating. However, the nanolayer coating experienced less severe damage, which had a strong impact on tribological behavior. A magnitude of order lower wear rate and four times lower steady state friction coefficient were found for the nanolayer coating.","Miletić, Aleksandar;Panjan, Peter;Čekada, Miha;Kovačević, Lazar;Terek, Pal;Kovač, Janez;Dražič, Goran;Škorić, Branko",2020-09-12,Ceramics International,"CrAlN/TiSiN,B: Microstructure,C: Fracture,C: Wear resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.034,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.034
Supersonic atmospheric plasma sprayed ZrO2 and ZrB2-SiC/ZrO2 coatings on Cf/Mg composites for anticorrosion,"To improve the corrosion resistance of the carbon fiber reinforced magnesium matrix composites (Cf/Mg composites), ZrO2 and ZrB2-SiC/ZrO2 composite coatings were prepared by supersonic atmospheric plasma spraying (SAPS) on Cf/Mg composites. The microstructure and phase composition of the coatings before and after the corrosion test were investigated. Open circuit potential and potentiodynamic polarization tests were measured at room temperature. Results revealed that the corrosion current density ( i corr ) of the ZrO2 coated Cf/Mg composites decreased by one order while the ZrB2-SiC/ZrO2 coated Cf/Mg composites reduced by two orders. Compared with Cf/Mg composites, the corrosion potential ( E corr ) of the ZrO2 and ZrB2-SiC/ZrO2 coated Cf/Mg composites increased by 220.5 mV and 1021.8 mV respectively, indicating that the ZrB2-SiC/ZrO2 composite coatings greatly improve the corrosion resistance of Cf/Mg composites. The uniform distribution of the SiC particles with small grain size in ZrB2 is responsible for the densification of the coating. The ZrB2-SiC/ZrO2 composite coatings provide a barrier for the substrate to impede the entry of Cl- in the corrosion solution, thus exhibiting a better corrosion resistance than the ZrO2 coating.","Shi, Xiao-Hong;Yang, Li;Qi, Le-Hua;Yan, Ning-Ning;Wang, Chang-Cong;Zhang, Hong-Rui",2018-12-15,Ceramics International,"Cf/Mg composites,Coating,Corrosion resistance,Supersonic atmospheric plasma spraying",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.357,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.357
Role of interface on electrical conductivity of carbon nanotube/alumina nanocomposite,"Interface of multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)/alumina (Al2O3) nanocomposites have been studied using TEM. At low sintering temperature (T sin =1500°C), a 3–5nm thick amorphous interface region was noticed. Nanocomposite sintered at 1700°C possessed a well-defined graphene layer coating on matrix grains as the interface between CNT and Al2O3. A mechanism of such layered interface formation has been proposed. No traceable chemical reaction product was observed at the interface even after sintering at 1700°C. It was noticed that while DC electrical conductivity (σ DC ) of 1500°C sintered 2.4vol% MWCNT/Al2O3 nanocomposite was only~0.02S/m, it raised to ~21S/m when sintering was done at 1700°C. Such 103 times increase in σ DC of present nanocomposite at a constant CNT loading was not only resulted from the exceptionally high electron mobility of CNT but the well-crystallized graphene interface on insulating type Al2O3 grains also significantly contributed in the overall increase of electrical performance of the nanocomposite, especially, when sintering was done at 1700°C.","Sarkar, Soumya;Das, Probal Kr.",2014-03-31,Ceramics International,"B.

Oxidation and ablation resistance of Fe2O3 modified ZrB2–SiC–Si coating for carbon/carbon composites,"To protect carbon/carbon composites against oxidation and ablation, a Fe2O3 modified ZrB2–SiC–Si coating was prepared by a two-step pack cementation. The microstructure, oxidation and ablation resistance of the Fe2O3 modified ZrB2–SiC–Si coating were studied. The results showed that the Fe2O3 modified ZrB2–SiC–Si coating had good oxidation and ablation resistance, and could effectively protect the carbon/carbon composites from oxidation at 1773K for 150h and ablation at 2573K for 60s. The excellent oxidation and ablation resistance of the coating were mainly attributed to its dense and large amount of ZrB2 in the coating.","Feng, Tao;Li, He-Jun;Hu, Man-Hong;Lin, Hong-Jiao;Li, Lu",2016-01-31,Ceramics International,"Carbon/carbon composites,Coating,Oxidation,Ablation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.08.105,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.08.105
Enhanced visible-light catalytic activity of Au nanoparticles loaded c-axis oriented Bi2VO5.5 porous thin films,"Au nanoparticles loaded c-axis oriented Bi2VO5.5 (BVO) porous thin films were prepared by using a simple spin-coating technique. The porous structures were formed through the hydrolysis of bismuth nitrate, Bi(NO3)3, one of the raw materials for synthesizing the BVO precursor solutions. The optimal photocatalytic rate of the porous thin film is three times more than that of pure BVO thin film. The enhancement of photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the Schottky barrier in the intimate interface between Au nanoparticles and BVO grains and the increase of absorption of light caused by surface plasmon resonance effect of gold nanoparticles. The possible degradation mechanism of Au–BVO-Methylene Blue system has been discussed based on the energy band structure and further trapping experiments. This study provides a simple method to prepare bismuth-containing oxide porous thin films without any pore-forming reagents, and the results suggest that the Au nanoparticles loaded BVO thin film is a promising candidate material for water or air treatment.","Xie, Wei;Qin, Ni;Li, Baojun;Bao, Dinghua",2015-08-31,Ceramics International,"Bi2VO5.5 thin film,Au nanoparticles loading,Porous,Spin-coating,Photocatalysis",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.03.045,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.03.045

Different parameters such as polymer concentration and dip coating time were considered while preparing the membrane. Special emphasis has been laid down on an extensive study of the physical and chemical properties of the membrane.

Microstructure evolution and isothermal oxidation properties of c-AlPO4 and SiC whisker co-modified mullite coated SiC-C/SiC composites,"An oxidation protective c-AlPO4 and SiC whisker co-modified mullite coating (c-AlPO4-SiCw-mullite) on SiC coated C/SiC composites were manufactured by hydrothermal electrophoretic deposition accompanied by magnetic stirring. Phase composition of c-AlPO4-SiCw-mullite coatings on SiC coated C/SiC composites with different deposition time was detected by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), element distribution and microstructure were investigated by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results show that a crack-free, dense and homogeneous coating was prepared by hydrothermal electrophoretic deposition method. The thickness, homogeneity and antioxidant properties of c-AlPO4-SiCw-mullite coating were improved with the extension of deposition time from 10 min to 30 min. The coating manufactured after deposition of 30 min showed smoothest surface and highest density, which can effectively protect C/SiC composites from oxidation for 160 h at 1773 K in air with a weight loss of 10.02 mg cm−2. Microstructural characterization after oxidation indicated that the failure of the c-AlPO4-SiCw-mullite coating was due to the consecutive formation of penetrative micro-cracks and micro-holes.","Pu, Dongmei;Chen, Pengju;Xiao, Peng;Li, Zhuan;Liu, Zeyan;Li, Yang",2019-11-30,Ceramics International,"C/SiC composites,c-AlPO4,Oxidation,Coating,Hydrothermal electrophoretic deposition",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.054,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.054
Ferroelectric and pyroelectric properties of novel lead-free polyvinylidenefluoride-trifluoroethylene–Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 nanocomposite thin films for sensing applications,"Novel ferroelectric nanocomposite films with bismuth sodium titanate, Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 (BNT), particles as fillers and polyvinylidenefluoride-trifluoroethylene, P(VDF-TrFE), copolymer as the matrix were prepared. The sol–gel method was used to synthesize the BNT nanopowder and spin coating was used to fabricate the nanocomposite films. The volume fraction of the BNT (∅) was in the range of 0.1–0.3. The structural, dielectric, pyroelectric, and ferroelectric properties of the samples were extensively investigated. Theoretical models, including Maxwell, Furukawa, Clausius–Mossotti, and effective medium theory (EMT), were employed to describe the effective dielectric permittivity of the composites. It is shown that the incorporation of BNT into the copolymer as a composite film significantly enhances the pyroelectric and ferroelectric properties. The P(VDF-TrFE)–BNT nanocomposite film with ∅=0.2 exhibits an exceptionally high remanent polarization of 115mC/m2 and pyroelectric coefficient of 50µC/m2 K1. The figure of merit for detectivity F D is found to increase from 52 to 75µC/m2 K1. The enhanced pyroelectric and ferroelectric properties obtained from this novel composite thin film strongly indicate the potential to apply this lead-free material as a thermal/infrared detector, energy storage, and micro-electromechanical system.","Mahdi, R.I.;Gan, W.C.;Halim, N.A.;Velayutham, T.S.;Majid, W.H.

Novel micro/nanostructured TiO2/ZnO coating with antibacterial capacity and cytocompatibility,"Insufficient osseointegration between implants and bone, and peri-implant infection are the two most common factors contributing to implantation failure. As such, implant materials should ideally be designed with antibacterial capacity while maintaining cytocompatibility. Combining Zn, a known antibacterial agent, with micro/nanostructures on the implant surface to promote osseointegration, potentially reduces peri-implant infection. To this end, in the present study, we developed novel bifunctional micro/nanostructured titanium oxide/zinc oxide (TiO2/ZnO) coating by micro-arc oxidation (MAO) followed by hydrothermal treatment. The release rate of the Zn2+ ions was reduced by heat treatment which established a balance between antibacterial capacity and cytocompatibility. The results demonstrate a simple approach for developing a Zn-based material that balances antibacterial capacity and cytocompatibility as a promising coating material for Ti implants.","Zhang, Ranran;Liu, Xujie;Xiong, Zhiyuan;Huang, Qianli;Yang, Xing;Yan, Hao;Ma, Jing;Feng, Qingling;Shen, Zhijian",2018-06-01,Ceramics International,"TiO2,ZnO,Surfaces,Biomedical applications",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.202,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.202
Synthesis and characterization of Ni-W/TiN nanocomposite coating with enhanced wear and corrosion resistance deposited by pulse electrodeposition,"To enhance mechanical properties and anti-corrosion capability of Ni-W alloy further, Ni-W/TiN nanocomposite coating has been co-deposited via pulse current co-deposition in this work. The effects of TiN nanoparticles and operating parameters on the structure and properties of the deposited coating were examined. It illustrated that the nanocomposite coatings are uniform, dense and crack-free, exhibiting dome-like or hill-valley like structure. The particles were homogeneously incorporated in the metallic matrix. RTC analysis indicated that the preferred orientation of Ni-W/TiN was (111) texture. The crystallite size was of 10–16 nm, indicating the formation of nanocrystalline structure. TiN concentration, duty cycle and frequency could influence the amount of TiN particle and W element in the coating, then regulating hardness and anti-wear behaviors. The low duty cycle and long deposition time could diminish the roughness of the coating. The inclusion of TiN nanoparticles in the nickel matrix could promote the nucleation of fresh nickel crystals and restrict the growth of already formed nickel grains, favoring the homogeneous growth and grain refinement of Ni-W crystals. The doped TiN particles would favor the preferred orientation (111) plane, enhanced the hardness, wear and corrosion resistance of Ni-W alloy. Electrochemical results illustrated that the best corrosion-resistant properties of the nanocrystalline coating could be obtained at TiN 30 g L−1, duty cycle of 20% and frequency of 60–200 Hz. The enhanced mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of Ni–W/TiN coating benefits its application in harsh corrosive environment.","Zhang, Weiwei;Li, Baosong;Ji, Cuicui",2019-08-01,Ceramics International,"Nanocomposite coating,Ni-W/TiN,Pulse electrodeposition,Corrosion resistance,Microstructure,Wear resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.101,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.101
Effect of triethanolamine on the electrophoretic deposition of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles in isopropanol,"Suspensions of hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles were prepared in isopropanol and triethanolamine (TEA) was used as the dispersant. It was found that H+TEA species generated by proton capturing from isopropanol are chemically adsorbed on HA nanoparticles via strong hydrogen bonding, enhancing their zeta potential and hence colloidal stability. Electrophoretic deposition was performed at 60V for various durations. It was found that sticking parameter (f factor) decreases with TEA concentration due to the increase in the potential (electrical+chemical) difference at the interface of deposit and suspension. The wet density of deposits increased with the zeta potential of particles as well as deposition time, due to the time dependent rearrangement of particles within the deposit caused by electro-osmotic flow which is stronger when the zeta potential is higher. It was found that the coating deposited from the suspension with 4mL/L TEA had the best corrosion resistance in Ringer's solution at 37.5°C due to its fine, homogeneous and crack-free microstructure acting as a good barrier against the corrosive medium.","Farrokhi-Rad, Morteza;Shahrabi, Taghi",2013-08-31,Ceramics International,"D.

The effect of bond coat on mechanical properties of plasma sprayed bioglass-titanium coatings,"Bioglass, known as 45S5 (45% SiO2, 6% P2O5, 24.5% CaO and 24.5% Na2O all in weight percent), was plasma sprayed onto a titanium substrate with and without Amdry 6250 (60% Al2O3 40% TiO2) as bond coating layer. Mechanical properties were evaluated in accordance with the ASTM C633 method and scanning electron microscopy was used for the microstructural characterization. Results indicated that it is possible to coat bioglass on titanium substrate by utilizing similar conditions used for hydroxyapatite. Application of bond coat layer in the plasma spraying of (45S5) bioglass on titanium substrate has increased the bonding strength about three times. The adhesive bonding observed at the bioglass metal interface turned into cohesive bonding by application of the bond coating layer. It has been observed that there is a uniform coating layer with a thickness of 110 and 80 μm depending on coating type with a little amount of porosity.","Goller, Gultekin",2004-12-31,Ceramics International,"Bioglass,Plasma spray coating,Bond coat layer,Titanium",10.1016/S0272-8842(03)00107-X,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0272-8842(03)00107-X
Sintering behavior and phase transformation of YSZ-LZ composite coatings,"Sintering behavior and phase transformations in yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)-based thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) control their applications in gas turbines operated at high working temperatures required for improved fuel efficiency. In this work, to control the sintering behavior and reduce phase transformations in YSZ-based TBCs, lanthanum zirconate (LZ) powder was blended with the YSZ feedstock powder, and YSZ-LZ composite coatings were fabricated using the air plasma spraying method. The influence of mixture weight ratio of YSZ to LZ (75:25, 50:50, and 25:75) on the sintering behavior and phase stability of the composite coatings was investigated through the isothermal exposure test at 1100, 1300, and 1400 °C. The as-coated composites showed the pyrochlore and tetragonal phases, indicating that the phases are LZ and YSZ, respectively. As the exposure temperature was increased, the phase transformation of YSZ from the tetragonal phase to the monoclinic phase was accelerated. The content of monoclinic phase was changed with the increasing LZ content after thermal exposure at 1300 and 1400 °C. In addition, the composites showed different sintering and bridging behaviors at the adjacent splats with the LZ content. The composites prepared with the blended feedstock powders of LZ and YSZ produced an obvious effect on the phase stability and mechanical properties.","Lyu, Guanlin;Kim, In-Soo;Song, Dowon;Park, Hyeon-Myeong;Kim, Jun Seong;Song, Taeseup;Myoung, Sangwon;Jung, Yeon-Gil;Zhang, Jing",2020-02-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,Lanthanum zirconate,Composite,Sintering behavior",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.093,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.093
Investigation and evaluation of structural color of TiO2 coating on stainless steel,"Titanium dioxide (TiO2) thin films were deposited on the stainless steel substrates by RF magnetron sputtering. In order to prevent film delamination and cracking caused by thermal mismatch between the stainless steel and TiO2 thin film, Ti thin film was initially deposited on the stainless steel as buffer layer.

Microstructure and properties of PZT53/47 thick films derived from sols with submicron-sized PZT particle,"A hybrid sol–gel process technology has been developed for the fabrication of thick films of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) thick films. In this paper, submicron-sized PZT powder was dispersed into a 2-methoxyethanol (MOE) diluted PZT sol solution uniformly to obtain a suspension/slurry for spin-coating purpose. Thick films on platinized silicon substrate with thickness of 10μm were obtained after annealing at 650°C for 30min. A higher sol solution concentration had larger single layer thickness, but a smaller one resulted in a more uniform surface. The resultant films have a composite microstructure. Dielectric and ferroelectric properties were investigated for all samples made from such process. Ferroelectric P–E hysteresis loop were obtained for most of them and the dielectric constant, remanent polarization, and coercive field for sample 3023 were 884, 20μC/cm2, and 95kV/cm, which was comparable with bulk PZT ceramic.","Zhao, Changlei;Wang, Zhihong;Zhu, Weiguang;Tan, Ooikiang;Hng, Hueyhoon",2004-12-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Interaction mechanism between Sm–Co magnets and glass coatings doped with mixed adherent oxides,"To protect Sm–Co magnets against oxidation in air at elevated temperatures, many efforts were made. In this work, borosilicate glass coatings containing mixed adherent oxides have been prepared onto Sm–Co magnet substrates by brush painting and then were fired at 830 °C for 3min following by cooling in argon atmosphere. The compositions and morphologies near interface of the coatings and the substrates were analyzed by using scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The results show that all glass coatings have good adherence with the substrates due to the formation of a silicate layer though they exhibit large difference in the thermal expansion coefficients. And a silicon diffusion layer forms over the internal oxidation zone of Sm–Co magnets. The appearance of precipitated reaction products in the glass coating area indicates that the glass coatings could react chemically with the magnet substrates. Transition metal cations of the adherence oxides are reduced by the ferrous ions that are selectively dissolved by the molten glass, and precipitate from the glass in sequence. The competitive reaction mechanism was discussed in detail.","Yu, Xiaojie;Han, Wei;Wang, Shuai;Song, Kuikui;Fang, Yikun",2019-10-15,Ceramics International,"Firing,Interfaces,Corrosion,Glass,Sm–Co magnet",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.041,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.041

Effect of free carbon on micro-mechanical properties of a chemically vapor deposited SiC coating,"SiC coatings with different content of free carbon were deposited on polycrystalline silicon substrate by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) by using CH3SiCl3-H2-Ar reactive system. The composition, microstructure and micro-mechanical properties of coatings were investigated. The results show that, when H2/MTS is 10, there is no free carbon in coatings. However, at the ratio of H2/MTS of 8.89, 7.97 and 7.32, the content of free carbon is falling in the range of 0.025–0.065, 0.100–0.800 and 0.005–0.035 respectively. The supersaturation of [H] is a key factor to control the generation of free C and the nucleation and growth of SiC coating. As to mechanical properties of SiC coatings, there may be a critical value of the content of free carbon in the coating. When the content of carbon is less than the critical value, the free carbon can enhance the mechanical properties of the coating; otherwise, the free carbon weakens the mechanical properties.","Wang, Linjing;Chen, Zhaoke;Wang, Bowen;Li, Yue;Zhang, Ruiqian;Liu, Guiliang;He, Zongbei;Fu, Daogui;Wang, Haoran;Xiong, Xiang",2018-10-01,Ceramics International,"SiC coating,CVD,Free C,Mechanical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.165,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.165

The pigment was characterized by XRD, SEM, TG-DSC, UV–vis and CIE L*a*b*C*h* colorimetric. The resulting green pigment showed that the chromaticity performance is better. The doping Co did not affect the main crystalline structure, all samples were retained ZnO wurtzite structure. The better green hue is a* = −15.35 and achieved a near-infrared reflectivity up to 40%, when CoO content was x = 0.04, combustion agent was glycine, calcination temperature was 1000 °C. The synthesized pigments have a better thermal stability, chemical stability and a small amount of cobalt oxide (2.8 wt%), and the preparation process is simple. Therefore, the green pigment of ZnO wurtzite structure has great potential in serving as cool pigments for building coatings.","Zhou, Nianying;Luan, Jiapan;Zhang, Yin;Li, Mingming;Zhou, Xiang;Jiang, Feng;Tang, Jun",2019-02-15,Ceramics International,"NIR,ZnO,Low cobalt content,Combustion method",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.241,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.241
Optical and electrical properties of sol–gel derived thin films of PbTiO3,"Thin films of polycrystalline PbTiO3 were prepared by sol–gel process—spin coating method. The substrates used were fused silica and stainless steel. The effect of post-deposition annealing on the electrical properties was analysed. Crystalline phase of PbTiO3 can only be obtained when the annealing temperature was higher than 500°C. The electrical measurements were conducted on metal-film-metal capacitors. Films annealed at 600°C exhibited crystallinity with perovskite phase, a dielectric constant of 125 and a dissipation factor of 0.035 at 1kHz. Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were found to be ohmic at lower fields and space charge limited current (SCLC), controlled by traps at higher fields. Transmission spectra of the films deposited on fused silica were recorded and from this, refractive index, extinction coefficient and thickness of the films were calculated. The refractive index was found to be in the range 1.90–2.25 for different wavelengths (300–900nm).","Yadav, H.O.",2004-12-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Influence of porosity on anisotropic thermal conductivity of SiC fiber reinforced SiC matrix composite: A microscopic modeling study,"The effect of porosity on the effective thermal conductivities calculation for continuous SiC fiber reinforced SiC matrix composites (SiCf/SiC) was studied in this work by finite element modeling. A three-dimensional representative volume element (RVE) containing detailed geometric features (fibers, matrix, fiber coatings and pores) was generated to rebuild the microstructure of SiCf/SiC and used to numerically calculate the effective transversal and longitudinal thermal conductivities of SiCf/SiC. Markworth model and parallel model were chosen as theoretical models to calculate the transversal and longitudinal thermal conductivities respectively. The numerical results obtained by RVE models were validated by comparison with the theoretical and experimental results. The results highlight the existing theoretical models cannot well predict the transversal thermal conductivity of SiCf/SiC with the existence of pores. In the analysis of the effect of porosity, real pore structure in SiCf/SiC was investigated to revel the relationship between porosity and the effective thermal conductivities. In the case of longitudinal thermal conductivity, the parallel model plus the linear term of porosity can still be used to predict the longitudinal thermal conductivity. As for the transversal thermal conductivity, a more proper Markworth model for SiCf/SiC transversal thermal conductivity calculation calibrated by incorporating porosity is proposed to efficiently calculate the transversal thermal conductivity at the end of this paper.","Wang, Jun;Chen, Yunsheng;Feng, Yajie;Zhao, Gang;Jian, Xigao;Huang, Qing;Yang, Lingwei;Xu, Jian",2020-12-15,Ceramics International,"Composite,SiC,Finite element model,Thermal conductivity,Porosity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.029,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.029
Effect of partial crystallization of an amorphous layer on the mechanical properties of ceramic/metal-glass coating by thermal spraying,"On the basis of successful preparation of amorphous-ceramic composite coating by atmospheric plasma spraying, a nanostructure bond-coat was prepared in-situ by inducing partial crystallization of an amorphous layer through heat treatment. The unit mechanics contribution rate (UMCR) was proposed to evaluate the mechanical properties of the coating, and the interference of the substrate to the evaluation of the coating mechanical properties was removed. In this work, the mechanical properties of the coating were systematically evaluated at the macroscopic, mesoscopic and microscopic scales through three-point bending (3 PB), microhardness and nanoindentation tests, respectively. Results show that the nanoparticle-ceramic coatings formed by heat treatment have a higher hardness and Young's modulus. The mechanical properties at the micro scale were obviously better than those at the macro scale. A partial crystallization was observed in the amorphous bond-coats in the process of heat treatment, and a large number of nanoparticles and solid solution were formed in the nanoparticle-ceramic coatings, effectively hindering the crack growth and improving the coating performance.","Li, Qiaolei;Song, Peng;Dong, Quan;Hua, Chen;Deng, Chunming;Li, Lu;Zheng, Biju;Lu, Jiansheng",2019-10-15,Ceramics International,"Amorphous-ceramic coating,Nanostructure,Crystallization,Young's modulus,Hardness,Thermal spraying",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.110,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.110
Degradation behaviors of three-dimensional hydroxyapatite fibrous scaffolds stabilized by different biodegradable polymers,"For bone tissue engineering, three-dimensional (3D) macroporous bioceramic scaffolds are usually preferred because they can mimic the inorganic components in natural bone tissues. Among them, fibrous bioceramic scaffolds are more preferred due to their biomimetic morphology, while they are usually fragile without polymer coating. In this study, hydroxyapatite nanowires (HANW) were prepared using hydrothermal technique and shaped into 3D macroporous scaffolds via steps of dispersing in water, freeze-drying and sintering. Five biodegradable polymers of different features were applied to coat the HANW scaffolds, and the polymers were poly(l-lactide) (PLLA), polycaprolactone (PCL), poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), poly(lactide-co-caprolactone) (PLCL) and gelatin. By optimzing the coating operation, the polymer coatings would not deform the fibrous structure of the HANW scaffold, and not cause cytotoxicity. All these polymers could stabilize and reinforce the HANW scaffold. Among them, the crystalline PLLA and the rigid gelatin could improve the mechanical properties of the polymer-coated HANW scaffolds more significant than the other three polymers. At the meantime, the PLLA or the gelatin coating could maintain the mechanical strengths of the composite scaffolds alongside degradation for a longer time than the other polymer coatings. In summary, a proper polymer coating could be helpful in obtaining 3D bioceramic fibrous scaffolds with improved performances targeting bone tissue engineering.","Guo, Liying;Du, Zhiyun;Wang, Yue;Cai, Qing;Yang, Xiaoping",2020-06-15,Ceramics International,"A.

Photocatalytic activity of visible-light-active iron-doped coatings prepared by plasma spraying,"This study examines the photocatalytic activity of coatings produced by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS). The applied spraying tools were gas-stabilized (GSP) and water-stabilized (WSP) plasma guns. The TiO2–Fe2O3 powder with and without Na2SiO3 additive was produced as agglomerates suitable for feeding into the plasma jet. The coatings are analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray fluorescence and X-ray diffraction. Photocatalytic degradation of butane under UV and under visible light, as well as the growth kinetics of the products – carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide – is quantified for all coatings and compared with a pure TiO2 coating. The coatings show a lamellar structure, as it is typical for this process. However, their porosity is rather high. Anatase titania from the feedstock powder is converted into rutile phase in all coatings; whereas the presence of FeTiO3 is detected in the coating without Na2SiO3 made by WSP and metallic iron in the GSP coating. The coating from powder with Na2SiO3 admixture is partly amorphous. This coating is photocatalytically active especially under UV, whereas under visible light it is overcome by the WSP coating. The GSP coating has the best photocatalytic activity under both different radiations.","Ctibor, P.;Pala, Z.;Stengl, V.;Musalek, R.",2014-01-31,Ceramics International,"B.

Effects of in situ BiScO3 nanoparticles on the microstructure and dielectric properties of Ba0.7Sr0.3Ti0.9925Tm0.0103@BiScO3 ceramics,"Ba0.7Sr0.3Ti0.9925Tm0.01O3 (BST) and core-shell structured BST@BiScO3 ceramics were prepared via a sol-precipitation and conventional sintering method. The single perovskite structure of the BST@BiScO3 ceramic powder and bulk materials were confirmed via X-ray diffraction. Additionally, transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that the surface of the BST powder was successfully coated in situ with amorphous BiScO3 nanoparticles. Scanning electron microscopy analysis indicated that the grain sizes of the BST@x mol.% BiScO3 (x = 1, 2, 3) ceramics decreased with increasing coating amounts. For x = 4 mol.%, the grain size of the BST@BiScO3 ceramic significantly increased relative to that of BST@x mol.% BiScO3 (x = 1, 2, 3), and some smaller particles were found to have precipitated. The results revealed that the dielectric constants of the BST@BiScO3 ceramics decreased at room temperature, but remained above 10000, and that the dielectric loss was significantly reduced. In addition, the Curie peak of BST@x mol.% BiScO3 (x = 1, 2, 3, 4) broadened and shifted to a higher temperature. The Curie peak of the BST@4 mol.% BiScO3 ceramic material was nearly a flat line. In this work, dielectric materials with high dielectric constants and low dielectric losses were successfully prepared; thus, they met the requirements of miniaturization and temperature stability for dielectric ceramics.","Ban, Huiyun;Fan, Yongzhe;Zhao, Xue;Du, An;Ma, Ruina;Cao, Xiaoming",2020-02-01,Ceramics International,"Core-shell structure,BiScO3,Dielectric property,Curie temperature",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.172,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.172
Laser cladding of yttria partially stabilized ZrO2 (YPSZ) ceramic coatings on aluminum alloys,"A feasibility study of laser clad 7 wt.% yttria partially stabilized zirconia ceramic coatings undoped or doped with 2.5 wt.% TiO2 to produce single tracks and partially overlapped tracks on the surfaces of AlSi9Cu3, AlZn10Si8Mg and AlSi10Mg alloys was carried out by using a 6 kW RS5000 continuous wave CO2 laser together with continuous powder-feeding system. The dependencies of the macro and microquality of ZrO2 ceramic coatings on the properties of the coating powder and laser parameters, and microstructure (such as morphology, phase transformation, etc.) were studied. The addition of 2.5 wt.% TiO2 into the YPSZ powder is beneficial for the controllable cracking in the ceramic layer on AlSi9Cu3 alloy. The ceramic layers on three kinds of aluminum alloys exhibit planar ZrO2 crystals with different sizes at the lower, columnar grains in the intermediate, and equiaxed grains at the upper region of the cross-sections. Small amounts of molten aluminum alloy are observed to segregate at the boundary regions of columnar or equiaxed grains in the ZrO2 layer because of the poor affinity. The ceramic layers consist mainly of non-transformable t’ phase and small amount of the retained c phase. Under conditions of optimum laser parameters and coating powder properties, the bonding to aluminum alloys is satisfactory with small dilution. Molten aluminum alloy is also observed to flow into the cracked ZrO2 layer at the bottom to seal these cracks. The hardness of the ZrO2 ceramic layer was 1415–1575 HV0.1, which is mainly attributed to the absence of porosity and fine grains in the ceramic layers.","Ouyang, J.H;Nowotny, S;Richter, A;Beyer, E",2001-12-31,Ceramics International,"B.

The correlation between the Na2SiO3·9H2O concentrations and the characteristics of plasma electrolytic oxidation ceramic coatings,"Various plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) ceramic coatings were fabricated on aluminum in the electrolytes with different concentrations of Na2SiO3·9H2O. The morphology of fractured cross-section and coating/substrate (C/S) interface, phase compositions, and corrosion behavior of these ceramic coatings were characterized employing field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The results showed that adding Na2SiO3·9H2O in the electrolyte could reduce the decrease amplitude of the voltage-time curve, and it can affect the types of the anodic film before the beginning of plasma discharges. A novel phenomenon was recorded as PEO treatment was carried out in the electrolyte with 1.85 g l−1 Na2SiO3·9H2O that the substrate was first covered by a barrier-type anodic film, and then a porous-type anodic film appeared after the barrier-type anodic film was broken down. The anodic film continued to grow for a long duration in the PEO process after being broken down. Characteristics of PEO ceramic coatings with a similar thickness acquired in various electrolytes were also evaluated. XRD results indicated that these ceramic coatings of similar thickness were mainly composed of α-Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3, and the α-Al2O3 proportion decreased with increasing Na2SiO3·9H2O concentration. The electrochemical data showed that the corrosion resistance of these PEO ceramic coatings of similar thickness decreased by adding Na2SiO3·9H2O in the electrolyte.","Yang, Zhong;Zhang, Xu-zhen;Wu, Ye-kang;Wu, Guo-rui;Wang, Dong-dong;Liu, Xin-tong;Han, Hui-ping;Su, Yu;Shen, De-jiu",2019-10-15,Ceramics International,"Anodic oxidation,Plasma electrolytic oxidation,Ceramic coating,Na2SiO3·9H2O concentration,Corrosion resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.191,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.191
Thermal cycling behavior and bonding strength of single-ceramic-layer Sm2Zr2O7 and double-ceramic-layer Sm2Zr2O7/8YSZ thermal barrier coatings deposited by atmospheric plasma spraying,"The single-ceramic-layer (SCL) Sm2Zr2O7 (SZO) and double-ceramic-layer (DCL) Sm2Zr2O7 (SZO)/8YSZ thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) were deposited by atmospheric plasma spraying on nickel-based superalloy substrates with NiCoCrAlY as the bond coat. The mechanical properties of the coatings were evaluated using bonding strength and thermal cycling lifetime tests. The microstructures and phase compositions of the coatings were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. The results show that both coatings demonstrate a well compact state. The DCL SZO/8YSZ TBCs exhibits an average bonding strength approximately 1.5 times higher when compared to the SCL SZO TBCs. The thermal cycling lifetime of DCL SZO/8YSZ TBCs is 660 cycles, which is much longer than that of SCL 8YSZ TBCs (150 cycles). After 660 thermal cycling, only a little spot spallation appears on the surface of the DCL SZO/8YSZ coating. The excellent mechanical properties of the DCL LZ/8YSZ TBCs can be attributed to the underlying 8YSZ coating with the combinational structures, which contributes to improve the toughness and relieve the thermal mismatch between the ceramic layer and the metallic bond coat at high temperature.","Wu, H.X.;Ma, Z.;Liu, L.;Liu, Y.B.;Wang, D.Y.",2016-08-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Bonding strength,Thermal cycling lifetime,Rare-earth zirconates",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.062,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.062
Additive manufactured polyamide foams with periodic grid as templates for the production of functional coated carbon-bonded alumina foam filters,"For the industrial production of metal melt filters, the replica technique is established since several decades. The polyurethane foams used as templates show a rather random structure with several defects which are transferred into the final filter structure after the replication. In order to generate filters with periodic structure and low amount of defects, a periodic foam model was used and open cell foams were produced by selective laser sintering of aged polyamide 12 (PA12). The PA12 foams were then used as sacrificial templates for the replica technique in the production route of Al2O3-C filters with functional coatings based on a cold sprayed Al2O3-C coating or a flame sprayed coating based on Al2O3. The differences in geometry between the computer-generated model foam, the sacrificial PA12 foam, the foam after carbonization, and the additional functionalized filters with the cold and hot coating were analyzed by computed tomography. Based on CT-data isosurfaces of the foams were generated to virtualize and distinguish the differences. Preliminary mechanical tests showed a higher cold crushing strength for the filters coated via flame-spray technique than the cold coating.","Herdering, Andreas;Abendroth, Martin;Gehre, Patrick;Hubálková, Jana;Aneziris, Christos G.",2019-01-31,Ceramics International,"Additive manufacturing,3D printing,Ceramic foam filters,Replication,Refractories,Metal melt filtration",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.146,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.146
Fabrication of tubular SiCf/SiC using different preform architectures by electrophoretic deposition and hot pressing,"This paper reports the processing feasibility of electrophoretic deposition combined with hot pressing in the fabrication of dense tubular SiCf/SiC composites using a cylindrical mold. A simulation of pressure distribution using ANSYS software was performed by varying the angular inclinations in a cylindrical mold with an ‘out → in’ configuration so as to ensure a maximum and uniform conversion of vertical hot press force to the lateral side of a centrally-located preform through graphite powder. The simulation revealed an inhomogeneous pressure distribution along the height of the preform, which could be minimized by mold optimization to achieve a more uniform tube density. To verify this, two different preform architectures such as 0/90° woven 2-D fabric rolled in a jelly state and filament winding with two plies having an inter-ply angle of 55° were hot-pressed using a mold fabricated based on the simulation after infiltrating the matrix phase by electrophoretic deposition. The density of the tube could be increased with more uniform microstructures. Although the tube using a filament winding preform exhibited a lower flexural strength (105MPa) and relative density (90%) than those with the preform rolled in a jelly state (221MPa, 95%), the results revealed a high degree of fiber pull-out due to the PyC coating on the SiC fiber.","Fitriani, Pipit;Sharma, Amit Siddharth;Septiadi, Arifin;Park, Ji-Yeon;Yoon, Dang-Hyok",2017-07-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Synthesis and properties of YSZ and CeO2 dual nanoparticles doped Ni–B matrix nanocomposite coating,"In this work, a novel yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and CeO2 dual nanoparticles doped Ni–B matrix nanocomposite coating has been fabricated by pulse current electrodeposition route. The effect of electrodeposition parameters on its structure, surface properties, corrosion and wear behaviors were evaluated. The nanocomposite coatings are compact with nodular-like morphology. The roughness is reduced with the increase of duty cycle. The average roughness (S a) was about 28–46 nm and the duty cycle of 70% benefits low roughness and fine-grained structure. The crystallite sizes are 10–15 nm. Crystallite size is more dependent on current density compared to duty cycle and frequency. The coating exhibits a nanocrystalline structure with the preferred orientation of Ni (111) texture. The phase composition and preferred orientation is independent of duty cycle and frequency, but more dependent on current density. AFM and XPS were utilized to analyze the surface properties. EIS and wear test results indicated that the electrodeposition parameters greatly affect its corrosion and wear resistance. Duty cycle of 30% and 90%, current density of 2 A dm−2, frequency of 500–1500 Hz were the optimal parameters for the best corrosion resistance and better electrochemical stability in the long-term service in 3.5 wt% NaCl media.","Li, Baosong;Zhang, Weiwei;Mei, Tianyong;Du, Shengsong;Miao, Yicheng;Li, Dandan",2020-04-15,Ceramics International,"Nanocomposite coating,Ni–B/YSZ-CeO2,Pulse electrodeposition,Corrosion behavior,Wear resistance,Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.030,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.030
Tunable chromaticity and enhanced luminous efficacy of white LEDs with phosphor-in-glass coating via multilayer screen-printing,"The phosphor-in-glass (PiG) coating was fabricated via multilayer screen-printing and low-temperature sintering. The PiG coating consisted of Eu2O3-doped P2O5-ZnO-B2O3 (PZB) glass, Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ (YAG:Ce) yellow phosphor, and CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ (CASN:Eu) red phosphor. Eu2O3 and CASN:Eu were used to provide red emission for tunable chromaticity of white light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and surprisingly, the luminous efficacy was also enhanced. The impact of the variation in the B2O3 content on the PZB glass and the effect of Eu2O3, YAG: Ce, and CASN:Eu on the luminescent properties of the PiG coating were investigated. The glass matrix with 8mol% B2O3 showed the lowest transition temperature and a suitable coefficient of thermal expansion. The spectra showed that the coating can be excited by blue light and produce yellow light and red light. The spatial distribution of the PiG coating was inspected by scanning electron microscopy, and it was observed that only a low erosion of phosphor by the glass matrix occurred. Furthermore, the white LEDs devices were constructed with the PiG coating on the blue LED chips. This method showed a decreased correlated colour temperature of 5137, a increased colour rendering index of 82.8 and an improvement in the luminous efficacy. The PiG coating for tunable chromaticity and enhanced luminous efficacy of white LEDs shows potential for application.","Xu, Xujia;Li, Hong;Zhuo, Yong;Li, Ruixin;Tian, Peijing;Xiong, Dehua;Chen, Mingxiang",2017-11-30,Ceramics International,"Phosphor-in-glass (PiG) coating,Multilayer screen-printing,White LEDs,Chromaticity,Luminous efficacy",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.065,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.065
"Influence of the selenization time on the properties of (Na0.1Cu0.9)2ZnSn(S,Se)4 thin films and their photovoltaic solar cells","(Na0.1Cu0.9)2ZnSn(S,Se)4 thin films with a single kesterite phase were synthesized using a sol-gel spin-coating method accompanied by rapid post-annealing. In this study, we investigated the effect of selenization time on the crystal quality and photoelectric performance of the (Na0.1Cu0.9)2ZnSn(S,Se)4 films. It was found that the crystallinity and morphology of the films was enhanced, and some of bigger Se substituted for the S site in (Na0.1Cu0.9)2ZnSn(S,Se)4 with increasing the selenization time. The bandgap of the film can be regulated from 1.04 eV to 0.99 eV by varying the selenization time. In addition, all films showed p-type conductive characteristics, and films with optimal electrical performance could be obtained by optimizing the selenization time. Finally, the (Na0.1Cu0.9)2ZnSn(S,Se)4 thin film with the best crystal quality and optical-electrical characteristics was obtained at an optimized selenization time of 15 min. A high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.92% was obtained for the (Na0.1Cu0.9)2ZnSn(S,Se)4 device, which is 42% higher compared to that of the undoped Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) device.","Sui, Yingrui;Jiang, Dongyue;Wu, Yanjie;He, Wenjie;Zeng, Fancong;Wang, Zhanwu;Wang, Fengyou;Yao, Bin;Yang, Lili",2020-09-15,Ceramics International,"(Na0.1Cu0.9)2ZnSn(S,Se)4 films,Electrical properties,Optical properties,Selenization time,Solar cells",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.141,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.141
SHS powders for thermal spray applications,"Self-propagating high temperature synthesis (SHS) is defined as a combustion process in which reagents, when ignited, spontaneously transform, to complete conversion, into products, due to the exothermic heat of reaction. This process has been recently recognised as a very promising technique for materials processing: ceramics, intermetallics and cermets with good physico-chemical properties have been produced at low costs. The use of SHS products for thermal spray applications represents a natural evolution of the technique. Demanded characteristics for thermal spray feedstock powders can be very different, depending on the spraying process, the operating conditions, the desired properties of the final coating, etc. However, technical requirements can also be extremely rigid and detailed. As a consequence, the production process must be reliable and flexible, while remaining possibly inexpensive. SHS is investigated as a promising candidate technique for the production of different powders to be used for thermal spray coatings with different applications: metallic mixtures are considered, as well as ceramic and composite powders. The chemical and morphological features of different SHS powders are described, and their technical characteristics of flowability and sprayability are outlined. Wear performance and hardness tests results for some of the coatings obtained by both air and vacuum plasma spraying of SHS powders are also reported.","Bartuli, Cecilia;Smith, Ronald W.;Shtessel, Emil",1997-12-31,Ceramics International, ,10.1016/0272-8842(95)00141-7,https://doi.org/10.1016/0272-8842(95)00141-7
Thermophysical properties of Er3Ce7Ta2O23.5 and Dy3Ce7Ta2O23.5 oxides,"In this study, two types of rare-earth tantalum oxides, Er3Ce7Ta2O23.5 and Dy3Ce7Ta2O23.5, are synthesised by sintering at 1873 K for 10 h. Their phase composition, microstructure, thermal conductivity, and thermal expansion coefficients are investigated. The obtained oxides exhibit a single-crystal fluorite-type lattice and dense microstructure. Owing to phonon scattering by the complex lattice framework, the large number of oxygen vacancies and substituting atoms, the obtained oxides have lower thermal conductivities than that of YSZ. The thermal expansion coefficient of Dy3Ce7Ta2O23.5 at 1473 K is slightly higher than that of Er3Ce7Ta2O23.5 owing to the larger lattice parameter of Dy3Ce7Ta2O23.5 than that of Er3Ce7Ta2O23.5.

After the freeze-casting step, samples were air sintered at 1250 °C for 2 h, which led to the crystallization of 58S. The obtained scaffolds were subsequently infiltrated with poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), a biodegradable polymer with potential application for bone tissue repair. The prepared materials were examined by helium pycnometry, laser granulometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Archimedes tests, X-ray microtomography (micro-CT), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), N2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and uniaxial compression tests. Samples cytotoxicity was evaluated by (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) tetrazolium reduction (MTT) and LIVE/DEAD assays. Their biocompatibility was also examined after soaking in a simulated body fluid (SBF) solution at 37 °C for up to 14 days. It was observed that the infiltration of PCL into the 58S scaffolds greatly increased their mechanical stability. Moreover, it was shown that these composites displayed a high cell viability (above 70%), which reveals that they did not interfere in the production of osteoblast cells. A hydroxyapatite coating was observed on the samples surface upon soaking in SBF, reinforcing that they are biocompatible materials. As far as we know, this is the first time that freeze-cast scaffolds were obtained using sol-gel derived 58S particles and a naphthalene-camphor mixture. Besides, as the infiltration of PCL into freeze-cast bioactive glass scaffolds improved their mechanical stability without impairing their bioactivity, this is a promising approach to prepare samples for load-bearing applications in bone tissue engineering.","dos Santos, Diogo M.M.;de Carvalho, Sandhra M.;Pereira, Marivalda M.;Houmard, Manuel;Nunes, Eduardo H.M.",2019-06-01,Ceramics International,"Composites,Porosity,Mechanical properties,Biomedical applications,Scaffolds",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.030,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.030
Microstructure and mechanical properties of yttria stabilized zirconia coatings prepared by plasma spray physical vapor deposition,"Plasma spray physical vapor deposition (PS-PVD) was used to deposit yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) coatings with different columnar morphologies by varying the spray distance. Although similar quasi-columnar structures were formed at the spray distances of 600mm and 1400mm, the formation mechanisms of particles in the coatings were different. Besides, an electron beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD) like columnar coating out of pure vapor was deposited at a spray distance of 1000mm and the columnar consisted of elongated nano-sized secondary columns. The hardness and Young׳s modulus of the coatings were investigated. Compared to the other two quasi-columnar structures, the EB-PVD like columnar coating exhibited higher hardness (~9.0GPa ) and Young׳s modulus (~110.9GPa), mainly due to its low porosity and defect.","Gao, Lihua;Guo, Hongbo;Wei, Liangliang;Li, Chenyi;Gong, Shengkai;Xu, Huibin",2015-08-31,Ceramics International,"Yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ),Microstructure,Young׳s modulus,Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs),Plasma spray physical vapor deposition (PS-PVD)",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.02.141,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.02.141
Asymmetric TiO2 hybrid photocatalytic ceramic membrane with porosity gradient: Effect of structure directing agent on the resulting membranes architecture and performances,"Asymmetric TiO2 hybrid photocatalytic ceramic membranes with porosity gradient have been fabricated via acid-catalyzed sol–gel method. Different structure directing agents (SDAs) i.e. Pluronic P-123, Triton X-100, Tween 20 and Tween 80 were incorporated in the preparation of TiO2 sol to obtain a porous multilayered TiO2 coated on the alumina ceramic support. Six different SDA-modified membrane specimens were fabricated. Four of which were coated with the TiO2 sols prepared using only one type of SDA. The remaining two specimens were fabricated via multilayer coating of different TiO2 sols prepared using different types of SDAs. Physico-chemical and morphological properties of different TiO2 layers were thoroughly investigated. The membrane M1 which had the most porous TiO2 sub-layers showed a high pure water permeability of 155Lm−2 h−1 bar−1. The membrane showed a relatively high Rhodamine B (RhB) removal of 2997mgm−2 over 8h treatment duration in the batch photoreactor, second only to the Pluronic-based TiO2 membrane (specific RhB removal of 3050mgm−2). All membrane specimens exhibited good performances while operated in the flow-through photocatalytic membrane reactor. Over 91% of RhB removal capability was retained after 4 treatment cycles. All membranes also showed self-cleaning property by retaining >90% of initial flux after 4 treatment cycles. The flexibility of optimizing membrane performances by fine-tuning the porosity gradient configuration of the photocatalytic layer has also been demonstrated.","Goei, Ronn;Lim, Teik-Thye",2014-06-30,Ceramics International,"Titanium dioxide (TiO2),Structure directing agent (SDA),Photocatalytic membrane reactor (PMR),Asymmetric membrane,Ceramic membrane",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.11.137,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.11.137
Percolation effect of V2O5 nanorod/graphene oxide nanocomposite films for stable fast-switching electrochromic performances,"In the present study, V2O5 nanorod (VR)/graphene oxide (GO) nanocomposite films that can be used as an electrochromic (EC) material have been developed using the sol-gel spin-coating method. In order to optimize the nanocomposite effect of GO consisting of the VR films on EC performances, we controlled the volume percentage of GO compared to vanadium precursor to 0, 1, 2, and 3 vol%. With the increase of GO in VR films to 2 vol%, the resultant films exhibited a densely percolated structure, which was due to the nanocomposite effect of GO to generate the VR growth by an interaction with the oxygen-containing functional groups of GO. Due to the effect of optimized GO, the VR/GO nanocomposite films fabricated with 2 vol% GO revealed fast switching speeds (2.5 s for the bleaching speed and 1.4 s for the colouration speed). This was the result of an improved electrical conductivity and ion diffusion coefficient and high cycling retention of transmittance modulation (94.90% after 500 cycles) stemming from the remarkable electrochemical stability of the films as compared to those of bare VR films.","Koo, Bon-Ryul;Bae, Ju-Won;Ahn, Hyo-Jin",2019-06-15,Ceramics International,"Films,Electrical properties,Optical properties,Carbon,Electrochromic performances",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.148,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.148
Preparation and properties of TaSi2-MoSi2-ZrO2-borosilicate glass coating on porous SiCO ceramic composites for thermal protection,"A TaSi2-MoSi2-ZrO2-borosilicate glass (TMZG) coating was prepared by a slurry method on a carbon fibre-reinforced porous silicon oxycarbide (SiCO) ceramic composite for thermal protection. The coating was well adhered to the substrate and showed a uniform thickness of approximately 375 µm. After thermal cycling from 1873 K to room temperature six times (total oxidation time of 180 min), the shape and dimension of the TMZG remain almost unchanged with no cracking or peeling of the coating surface. The TMZG-coated sample exhibits good oxidation resistance because of a molten SiO2 film with ZrSiO4 particles distributed on the outer layer of the coating. After ablation testing under an oxyacetylene flame at 1927 K for 90 s, the linear ablation rate of the TMZG coated sample are 8.33 × 10−4 mm/s. The whole coating retains integrity, preventing substrate ablation during the test. The TMZG coating with excellent temperature resistance shows broad applicability in thermal insulation materials.","Li, Xiafei;Feng, Junzong;Jiang, Yonggang;Lin, Hao;Feng, Jian",2018-11-30,Ceramics International,"Porous SiCO ceramic composites,TaSi2-MoSi2-ZrO2-borosilicate glass coating,Anti-oxidation,Ablation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.159,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.159
Low-temperature conducting performance of transparent indium tin oxide/antimony tin oxide electrodes,"We fabricated transparent indium tin oxide (ITO)/antimony tin oxide (ATO) electrodes using a combined process of spin-coating of hybrid ITO nanoinks, electrospraying of ATO, and hydrogen (H2) activation carried out at a low annealing temperature of 200°C. The produced ITO electrode exhibited an enhanced surface densification and phase conversion of In(OH)3 to ITO. As a result, the H2-activated ITO/ATO electrodes exhibited excellent transparent conducting performances with a superior sheet resistance of ~47.5 Ω/□ and a good transmittance of ~85.3% as compared to the ITO and ITO/ATO electrodes. Despite the use of the low annealing temperature, the achieved improvement in the conducting performance could be attributed to the synergistic effect of the enhanced carrier concentration and the Hall mobility related to the improved surface densification achieved with the electrosprayed ATO thin film and reduction of the residual In(OH)3 phase by H2 activation. Therefore, our method can be used as a novel strategy for obtaining high-performance solution-processed transparent conducting oxides at a low annealing temperature of 200°C for use in various optoelectronic applications.","Koo, Bon-Ryul;Bae, Ju-Won;Ahn, Hyo-Jin",2017-06-01,Ceramics International,"Transparent conducting oxides,Surface,Electrical properties,Optical properties,Electrodes",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.02.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.02.006
Electrophoretic deposition of bioactive wollastonite and porcelain–wollastonite coatings on 316L stainless steel,"Wollastonite and porcelain–wollastonite coatings on stainless steel were obtained by electrophoretic deposition using acetone as dispersive medium. A direct electric current of 800V for 3min was used for obtaining the single wollastonite coating. A well-sintered layer was observed after heat treatment at 1050°C for 1h in air. The two-layer coating was obtained by depositing dental porcelain at 400V for 30s followed by the deposition of wollastonite at 400V for 3min. After forming the two layers, this complex coating was heat treated at 800°C for 5min. Under these conditions, strong bonds of both the interface wollastonite–porcelain and that of porcelain–metallic substrate were observed. The in vitro bioactivity assessment of the coatings was performed by immersing the deposited substrates in simulated body fluid (SBF) for 21 days. All the materials showed to be highly bioactive through the formation of a homogeneous apatite layer.","Rodríguez, H.H.;Vargas, G.;Cortés, D.A.",2008-07-31,Ceramics International,"D. Porcelain,D.

TiB2–ZrB2–SiC composite ceramic coating with the formation of solid-phase (TixZr1-x)B2 deposited by atmospheric plasma spraying as a barrier to molten cryolite-based salt,"TiB2, ZrB2, and SiC powders with particles measuring several micrometers were first agglomerated and then deposited onto the substrate of a porous carbon block as a barrier to molten cryolite-based salt. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy were conducted to investigate the fine microstructure of the obtained ceramic coating and to elucidate the evolution of agglomerated powder from sprayed particles in plasma jet to splats on a substrate. Results indicated that a highly dense ceramic coating consisting of a solid solution (TixZr1-x)B2, residual TiB2, and ZrB2 was obtained. The compactness of the coating and the formation of a solid solution phase was mainly caused by a SiC-rich liquid phase, as determined from a boride and silicon carbide pseudodiagram. After being submerged in molten cryolite-based salt for 8 h, the ceramic coating was firmly bonded to a carbon block. No molten slat permeated the ceramic coating.","Liu, Xuezhang;Deng, Chunming;Zhang, Xiaofeng;Duan, Xiaohua;Zhao, Ruimin;Li, Shunhua",2020-09-30,Ceramics International,"Refractory coating,Solid solution,Corrosion resistance,Cryolite-based slat,Atmospheric plasma spraying",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.149,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.149
Preparation and characterization of multilayer coatings on tool steel,"This work is focused on the design and preparation of ZrO2-, TiN- and TiAlN-based multilayer using a combination of different strategies. Films have been deposited onto stainless and tool steels with the aim of characterizing the coatings as well as analyzing their behavior in order to optimize service capacity, extend working life and minimize production costs.

Electrophoretic deposition and characterization of thin hydroxyapatite coatings formed on the surface of NiTi shape memory alloy,"The NiTi surface was modified so as to improve its biocompatibility by forming multifunctional protective layers of TiO2 and hydroxyapatite (HAp). A special focus was placed on obtaining relatively thin (~2.4µm), crack-free and homogenous HAp coatings using the electrophoretic deposition method (EPD). A well-dispersed and stable colloidal suspension with the predominant particles size of ca 100nm was used for the deposition process. The coatings were obtained at the following deposition parameters: 40V /120s and after vacuum-sintering at 800°C by 2h providing to an increase of the surface roughness. It was revealed that the composite coatings had adhesion features of (15.1±1.4) MPa and crack resistance to deformation of 2.48%. Moreover, no layer spalling was found, even at the maximum deformation value ε=3.53%. The newly manufactured coatings were also observed to have no impact on the martensitic transformation responsible for shape memory effect. Additionally, a two-step martensitic transformation below room temperature was observed.","Dudek, Karolina;Goryczka, Tomasz",2016-12-31,Ceramics International,"Electrophoretic deposition (EPD),Hydroxyapatite (HAp) coatings,NiTi shape memory alloy (SMA)",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.09.074,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.09.074
Fabrication and photocatalytic performance of Sn-doped titania hollow spheres using polystyrene as template,"Sn-doped anatase hollow spheres were fabricated using a template method involving polystyrene spheres as core and anatase coating as shell. The synthesis route included the preparation of PS spheres, followed by their coating by Sn-doped TiO2 sol-gel precursor and subsequent removal of the PS cores by pyrolysis and recrystallization at 500°C for 2h. The observation of minor amounts of rutile suggests that Sn promotes the anatase → rutile phase transformation. At doping levels of ≤ 1.0mol% Sn, the unsaturated solubility and increasing defect densities enhanced nucleation. At 1.0–2.0mol% Sn, the solubility remained unsaturated but increasing Sn incorporation reduced crystallinity owing to lattice deformation and partial amorphization. At 2.0–3.0mol% Sn, solid solution saturation occurred, resulting in excess dopant precipitation, leading to grain boundary pinning and partial blockage of surface-active sites. Ionic radii, thermodynamic, phase equilibria, intervalence charge transfer, and defect chemistry considerations suggest that Sn4+ exhibits substitutional solid solubility in the TiO2 lattice. The photocatalytic performance was in the order 1.0 > 1.2 > 1.5 ≈ 0.7 > 2.0 > 0.0 > 3.0mol% Sn. This ranking is consistent with the dominant role of crystallinity such that, at ≤ 1.0mol% Sn, the performance increased owing to enhanced nucleation from low defect density and increasing crystallinity while, at 1.0–2.0mol% Sn, the performance decreased from increased lattice strain and effective partial amorphization, and, at 2.0–3.0mol% Sn, it decreased from maximal lattice strain and blockage of active sites.","Wang, Jieyu;Ren, Hangjuan;Chen, Wen-Fan;Koshy, Pramod;Sorrell, Charles Christopher",2018-04-01,Ceramics International,"Titania,Sn-dopeing,Hollow spheres,Polystyrene,Photocatalytic performance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.092,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.092
Preparation of lanthanum zirconate films with a widely controllable La/Zr ratio by LCVD,"Lanthanum zirconate (LZ) films with a controllable La/Zr composition were prepared by laser enhanced chemical vapor deposition (LCVD). The effects of different precursors ratio, i.e. the La(dpm)3/Zr(dpm)4 molar ratio, on composition, crystal structure, morphology and electrical conductivity of films were investigated. The formation region of columnar and purely cubic pyrochlore structured LZ films with a controllable La/Zr molar ratio in a wide range of 0.51–2.53 was mapped. Crystal structure changed with the different precursor's ratio, which was caused by atomic substitution between lanthanum and zirconium, being proved by combining with experimental and theoretical XRD patterns. It is found that electrical conductivity of non-stoichiometric LZ films is up to 4.3 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 1073 K. The columnar pyrochlore structured LZ films with a wide region of non-stoichiometric compositions are expected to be candidates for many potential applications, such as dielectric, thermal barrier coatings and nuclear waste treatment materials.","Wang, Duojin;Liu, Yuchen;Zhu, Changhua;Yang, Guang;Liu, Bin;Chen, Hongfei;Cui, Yuanyuan;Luo, Hongjie;Gao, Yanfeng",2018-06-15,Ceramics International,"Lanthanum zirconate,Laser enhanced chemical vapor deposition,Lanthanum zirconium atomic ratio,Density functional theory",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.088,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.088
Solidification mechanism and microstructure evolution of Al2O3-ZrO2 ceramic coating prepared by combustion synthesis and thermal explosion spraying,"The solidification mechanism and microstructure of the hypoeutectic Al2O3-ZrO2 (Al2O3:72mol%) ultra-fined ceramic coating prepared by combustion synthesis and rapid plate cooling method were analyzed by the heat transfer process and dynamic characteristics. The rapid solidification process inhibited the transformation from the t-ZrO2 to m-ZrO2 at low temperatures. The growth rate of the solid-liquid interface to form the amorphous and nano-crystalline Al2O3-ZrO2 was about 65.7mm/s and 13.7mm/s, respectively. The mechanism formation of both the amorphous and nano-crystalline areas were analyzed using rapid solidification models. When the growth rate reduced to about 8.23mm/s, large quantities of nanosized eutectic structures was identified by SEM in the pseudo-eutectic area. The interphase spacing of the eutectic structures was 40–100nm. In addition, some typical divorced eutectic structures appeared at this area. After that, micron dendrites (0.2–0.6µm) took the main part when the growth rate decreased to about 3.67mm/s for such a hypoeutectic Al2O3-ZrO2 binary system. The nano-crystalline area showed the highest nanohardness (22GPa). This paper may provide new guidance to prepare high performance Al2O3-ZrO2 ceramics both in experiment and theory.","Pan, Jiayu;Zheng, Yongting;Zheng, Yuandi;Ye, Wei;Yu, Wanjun",2017-04-01,Ceramics International,"Microstructure evolution,Rapid solidification,Al2O3/ZrO2,Ultra-fined ceramic coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.11.153,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.11.153
Microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of a vacuum-brazed Al2O3/Ti joint with Mo-coating on Al2O3 and Ti surfaces,"Au-foil was used to braze Al2O3 and Ti to obtain a joint with biocompatibility. Mo-coatings of thicknesses 2 or 4 μm were deposited on the surfaces of Al2O3 and Ti by magnetron sputtering before the brazing experiments. The microstructure evolution and mechanical property of the Al2O3/Ti joint were systematically investigated. Due to the (i) different wettabilities of Ti and Mo and (ii) thermal expansion mismatch between dissimilar components, defects were observed in the Al2O3 Mo/Au/Ti joint when only Al2O3 was metallised by a Mo-coating. However, the Al2O3 Mo/Au/MoTi joints were nearly defect free when both Al2O3 and Ti were coated with Mo films. The typical microstructure of an Al2O3 Mo/Au/MoTi joint was characterised by Al2O3/Mo-rich phase + Au-rich phase/TiAl intermetallic compound/Au-rich phase + TiAu2 intermetallic compound+(Ti, Mo) solid solution/Ti. The distribution of the (Ti, Mo) solid solution, width of the reaction layer, and quantity of the TiAl intermetallic compound varied with brazing temperature and holding time. The thickness of Mo-coating only affected the width of the reaction layer. Compared to those of the holding time and Mo-coating thickness, the influence of the brazing temperature on the microstructure and shear strength of joints was the most noticeable. The mechanical properties of the Al2O3/braze interface and seam were key factors for determining the shear strength of the Al2O3 Mo/Au/MoTi specimens. The maximum shear strength was 208 MPa for the Al2O3 Mo/Au/MoTi couple obtained at 1100 °C for 5 min with a Mo-coating thickness of 2 μm.","Lin, Panpan;Lin, Tiesong;He, Peng;Wang, Maochang;Yang, Jia",2019-06-15,Ceramics International,"Al2O3,Commercially pure titanium,Au foil,Mo-coating,Microstructure,Joint strength",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.163,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.163
Effect of temperature and film thickness on structural and mechanical properties of c-axis oriented Zn0.95Mg0.05O thin films,"Zn0.95Mg0.05O solutions were synthesized by the sol-gel technique using Zn and Mg-based alkoxide. The structure, microstructure, and mechanical properties of the c-axis oriented Zn0.95Mg0.05O thin films were investigated as a function of film thickness and temperature. Zn0.95Mg0.05O thin films were grown on a glass substrate using the sol-gel dip-coating method. Then, the thin films were annealed at various temperature values (500–600 °C for 30 min) under air. X-ray diffraction of the Zn0.95Mg0.05O thin films results indicated that all samples had a ZnO wurtzite structure and (002) orientation. The photoluminescence (PL) measurements revealed the near-band emission (NBE), the Zni related emission, and the excess oxygen interstitials and their complexes with zinc vacancies. The surface morphologies and microstructure of all samples were characterized by using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). It was observed that surface morphologies of Zn0.95Mg0.05O thin film were dense, uniform, crack free and without pinhole. Effects of film thickness and temperature on stress in Zn0.95Mg0.05O thin films were analyzed theoretically to see whether there was any crack inside of the thin films and substrate or not. It was found that the stress component values of thin films were compressive; however, for glass substrate they were tension.","Tosun, M.;Arda, L.",2019-09-30,Ceramics International,"ZnMgO,Residual stress,Sol-gel,Thin films",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.145,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.145

The results show that the bismuth ferrite thin films annealed at 550°C is single phase and the grain size increases with the rise of annealing temperature. The band gap of bismuth ferrite thin films annealed at 550–650°C is between 2.306eV and 2.453eV. With the rise of the annealing temperature, the remnant polarization gradually decreases and the coercive electric field increases. The short circuit photocurrent density decreases with the rise of annealing temperature, and the open circuit photovoltage and the power conversion efficiency of bismuth ferrite thin films annealed at 550°C are higher than the thin films annealed at higher temperature.","Lin, Zebin;Cai, Wei;Jiang, Weihai;Fu, Chunlin;Li, Chun;Song, Yunxia",2013-12-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Bioinspired design of triboceramics: Learning from the anisotropic micro-fracture response of dental enamel under sliding contact,"In the quest for novel ceramics for tribological applications via bioinspired design, the differences in the fracture modes that arise upon scratching relevant locations of ceramic-like tooth enamel are investigated. It is found that fracture initiates from weak rod-sheath interfaces at relatively low loads, independent of the sliding direction. However, the geometry and propagation of the cracks depends on the orientation of the interfaces relative to the maximum tensile stress: scratching along the occlusal surface propagates approximately sinusoidal cracks, parallel to the sliding direction, while scratching along the cross-section produces straight cracks that propagate normal (scratch parallel to occlusal surface) or parallel (scratch perpendicular to occlusal surface) to the sliding direction. The formation of cracks is hindered in scratching near the enamel-dentine junction. Implications for the microstructural design of triboceramics (bulks and coatings) with improved durability are discussed.","Sánchez-González, Estíbaliz;Rodríguez-Rojas, Fernando;Pinilla-Cienfuegos, Elena;Borrero-López, Oscar;Ortiz, Angel L.;Guiberteau, Fernando",2020-12-15,Ceramics International,"Bioinspired triboceramics,Enamel,Microstructure,Sliding contact,Fracture",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.292,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.292
Fabrication and characterization of ceramic coatings with alumina–silica sol-incorporated α-alumina powder coated on woven quartz fiber fabrics,"The formation and properties of dense silica/α-alumina coatings derived from alumina–silica sol-incorporated coarse alumina powder (median particle size d 50=0.509μm) using Al(NO3)3·9H2O and tetraethyl orthosilicate as precursors have been investigated. Phase compositions and thermal evolution analysis of the coatings as well as interface microstructure between the coatings and the matrix were characterized by means of XRD, XRF, DSC-TG, TEM, SEM supplemented with EDS, and tensile strength tester. Silica/α-alumina coatings combined with quartz fiber matrix are homogeneously integrated with distinct inter-diffusion near the interface. The heat conduction mechanism of the quartz fiber matrix was influenced by the dense silica/α-alumina ceramic coatings, and the prepared coatings provide practical thermodynamic stability and desired mechanical strength for the woven quartz fiber fabrics.","Lu, Hao-Ran;Wang, Chang-An",2013-08-31,Ceramics International,"Quartz glass fibers,SiO2/Al2O3 coatings,Sol–gel technique",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.01.020,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.01.020
Preparation of Al2O3 coating on TiN coating by polymer-assisted deposition to improve oxidation resistance in coking inhibition applications,"In order to inhibit the metal catalytic coking and improve oxidation resistance of single TiN coating, the TiN/Al2O3 double layer coatings were designed as a chemically inert coating for methylcyclohexane supercritical pyrolysis. Internal TiN coatings were prepared by atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition using TiCl4–H2–N2 system. The external Al2O3 coatings with different thicknesses were prepared on the TiN surface by polymer-assisted deposition, and the coating with the most suitable thickness was further annealed at different temperatures of 600, 700, 800 and 900 °C. The morphology, elemental and phase composition of TiN/Al2O3 coatings were characterized by SEM, EDX and XRD respectively. The chemical state information of the coating elements was based on Ti 2p, Al 2p core level X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra. The results indicated that the external Al2O3 coating will partially peel off at 900 °C annealing temperature. The thermogravimetric analysis results indicated that all TiN/Al2O3 coatings show better oxidation resistance than single-layer TiN coating. The anti-coking test with methylcyclohexane supercritical pyrolysis showed that the TiN/Al2O3 coatings can effectively cover the metal catalytic sites and eliminate metal catalytic coking. However, the acid sites of external Al2O3 coating slightly promoted coking, so the anti-coking ratios of TiN/Al2O3 coatings were smaller than that of TiN. Thus, the addition of external Al2O3 coating can greatly improve the oxidation resistance of TiN coatings with little loss of coking resistance.","Gong, Xianlong;Wang, Bo;Han, Huaizhi;Kang, Tao;Zhu, Quan;Wang, Jianli;Li, Xiangyuan",2020-04-15,Ceramics International,"TiN/Al2O3 double layer,Polymer-assisted deposition,Oxidation resistance,Anti-coking coating,Supercritical pyrolysis",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.281,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.281
Preparation and characterization of vitrified CeO2 coated cBN composites,"The performances of vitrified cBN composites are deeply affected by the wettability of vitrified bonds on cBN particles. CeO2 coated cBN particles were successfully prepared for the further improvement of the covering and wetting of cBN by vitrified bonds. The microstructure and properties of vitrified cBN composites were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), hot stage microscope (HSM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and flexural strength. Results showed that the prepared CeO2 coating on the surface of cBN was uniform and dense. Besides, the improved wettability of vitrified bonds on CeO2 coated cBN particles accompanied with the formation of Ce–O–Al and N–Si confirmed by XPS were supposed to conduce to enhancing the holding power of the vitrified bonds to cBN particles, which resulted in increasing the flexural strength of vitrified cBN composites by 9.16%. Thus, coating cBN with CeO2 was a potential and effective method to obtain vitrified cBN composites with higher flexural strength.","Shi, Jiang;He, Feng;Xie, Junlin;Liu, Xiaoqing;Yang, Hu",2019-11-30,Ceramics International,"Ceria,cBN,Vitrified bonds,Chemical bonding",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.222,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.222
Thermal properties of La3TaO7 and La2AlTaO7 oxides,"The La3TaO7 and La2AlTaO7 oxides were prepared by solid state reaction method. The phase composition, microstructure and thermal properties were examined. Results show that pure La3TaO7 and La2AlTaO7 oxides are prepared successfully. From 20°C to 1200°C, the average thermal conductivities of La3TaO7 and La2AlTaO7 ceramics are 1.12W/mK and 1.71W/mK, respectively, which are much lower than that of YSZ. Compared to La2AlTaO7, La3TaO7 has lower thermal conductivity due to its higher atom-mass difference between the substituting and the substituted atoms. The thermal expansion coefficient of La3TaO7 is higher than that of YSZ, and the thermal expansion coefficient of La2AlTaO7 is close to that of YSZ. As compared with La2AlTaO7, the higher thermal expansion coefficient of La3TaO7 can be ascribed to its lower electro-negativity difference between ions at sites A and B. The La3TaO7 and La2AlTaO7 oxides can be explored as potential ceramic materials for thermal barrier coatings.","Haoming, Zhang;Yan, Feng;Xiaoge, Chen;Hongsong, Zhang;Yanxu, Liu;An, Tang;Bo, Ren",2017-01-31,Ceramics International,"Ceramics,Thermal barrier coatings,Thermal conductivity,Thermal expansion coefficient",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.005
Spray coated seed layer for scalable synthesis of aligned ZnO nanowire arrays on FTO substrate and their photovoltaic properties,"Spray coating has been employed as a non-vacuum route for deposition of a ZnO seed layer on large-area fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates. Optimization of spray parameters, particularly precursor flow rate and volume, was found to yield preferably oriented and uniform ZnO seed layer. Vertically aligned single crystalline ZnO nanowire arrays with controlled features were grown on aforementioned substrate at 95°C by a hydrothermal method. The current–voltage characteristics of dye-sensitized solar cells fabricated with the aligned ZnO nanowire arrays as photoanode have demonstrated a maximum photocurrent density of 1.86mAcm−2 under 1 sun illumination (100mWcm−2, AM 1.5G).","Islavath, Nanaji;Ramasamy, Easwaramoorthi;Das, Dibakar;Joshi, Shrikant V.",2015-04-30,Ceramics International,"C.

Carbon layer on the surface of PNb9O25 nanowires offers lots of areas for charge transfer,"Carbon coating always has a positive effect on improving the electrochemical performance of electrode materials for lithium ions batteries and its mechanism has once drawn great attention, yet few studies offer a model to elaborate on it. In this study, we select PNb9O25 nanowires as anode material and coat carbon on them to investigate how carbon layer does affect its electrochemical performance. Meanwhile, a theoretical model has proposed for the investigation of mass transfer and electron transfer at the surface of PNb9O25. The result suggests that due to the presence of carbon layer, mass transfer and electron transfer at the surface of PNb9O25 shows a decent boost, leading to the improvement of electrochemical performance at the high current density.","Yu, Haoxiang;Zhang, Jundong;Zheng, Runtian;Xia, Maoting;Deng, Chenchen;Zhang, Xikun;Yan, Huihui;Shu, Jie;Wang, Zhen-Bo",2020-12-15,Ceramics International,"PNb9O25,Carbon coating,Proposed theoretical model,Mass transfer,Electron transfer",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.079,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.079
Fabrication of Cf/ZrC–SiC composites using Zr–8.8Si alloy by melt infiltration,"Cf/ZrC–SiC composites were fabricated by melt infiltration at 1800°C using Zr–8.8Si alloy and carbon felt preforms. Microstructural analysis showed the formation of both ZrC and SiC phases in the matrix, in which ZrC acted as a main composition of the resulting composites. The results showed that carbon matrix reacted preferentially with Si of Zr–8.8Si alloy, which caused the formation of SiC first and then ZrC. The designed carbon coating by pyrolysis prevented the severe reaction between fibers and the melt. The composites could be more dense and uniform with the bending strength of 53.3MPa, when preforms had a high open porosity (47.2%) with small size pores (10–40μm).","Jiang, Jinming;Wang, Song;Li, Wei;Chen, Zhaohui",2015-08-31,Ceramics International,"B.

On reactive suspension plasma spraying of calcium titanate,"This study shows possibility of preparation of calcium titanate powder and coatings by reactive suspension plasma spraying. Suspension of mixture of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) powders in ethanol was fed into hybrid plasma torch with a DC-arc stabilized by a water–argon mixture (WSP®-H 500). Various feeding distances and angles were used in order to optimize suspension feeding conditions. In the next step, the coatings were deposited on stainless steel substrates and the effect of substrate temperature on microstructure and chemical and phase composition of the coatings was studied. Captured in-flight particles and deposits were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy SEM equipped with EDX detector. Obtained results confirm that chemical reaction of CaCO3 and TiO2 forming CaTiO3 perovskite takes place during the interaction of suspension with plasma jet. The conditions of rapid cooling during spraying process result in the presence of metastable CaTiO3 high-temperature tetragonal and cubic phases. Increase in the substrate temperature increases the content of the calcium titanate in the deposit and the coatings microstructure becomes more compact. Obtained results show that WSP®-H technology may be used for deposition of the CaTiO3 powders and coatings by reactive plasma spraying.","Kotlan, Jiri;Pala, Zdenek;Musalek, Radek;Ctibor, Pavel",2016-02-15,Ceramics International,"A.

The pyrolytic conversion of perhydropolysilazane into silicon nitride,"Polymeric precursors to ceramics have the potential to enable production of ceramic articles in novel forms, with novel microstructures, and improved properties. The polymer-to-ceramic conversion process is not sufficiently understood for this approach to be widely utilised. Perhydropolysilazane converts to high purity silicon nitride (Si3N4), and has been shown to be a useful coating and matrix precursor. The conversion of PHPS to Si3N4 is being examined by Solid State, Magic Angle Spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy and other techniques. This paper summarises the results to date of this investigation.","Schwab, Stuart T.;Graef, Renee C.;Blanchard, Cheryl R.;Dec, Steven F.;Maciel, Gary G.",1998-12-31,Ceramics International, ,10.1016/S0272-8842(97)00010-2,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0272-8842(97)00010-2
Ultra-high temperature ceramic coating for carbon/carbon composites against ablation above 2000K,"To improve the ablation resistance of carbon/carbon composites at the temperature above 2000K, a ZrB2-SiC-ZrC ultra-high temperature ceramic coating was prepared by combination of supersonic atmosphere plasma spray (SAPS) and reaction melt infiltration. The micro-holes in ZrB2-Si-ZrC coating prepared by SAPS were effectively filled and the compactness and interface compatibility between the coating and C/C composites was improved through the reaction melt infiltration process. The ultra-high temperature ceramic coating exhibited good ablation resistance under oxyacetylene torch ablation above 2000K. After ablation for 120s, the mass and linear ablation rates of the ZrB2-SiC-ZrC coated C/C samples were only −0.016 × 10−3 g/s and 1.30µm/s, respectively. Good ablation resistance of the ultra-high temperature ceramic coating is mainly attributed to the dense coating structure and the improvement of interface compatibility between the coating and C/C composites.","Zhang, Yulei;Wang, Haohao;Li, Tao;Fu, Yanqin;Ren, Jincui",2018-02-15,Ceramics International,"Carbon/carbon composites,ZrB2-SiC-ZrC coating,Ablation resistance,Supersonic atmosphere plasma spraying,Reaction melt infiltration",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.066,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.066
Evaluation of oxidation behavior of laser clad CoWSi–WSi2 coating on pure Ni substrate at different temperatures,"Microstructural aspects of CoWSi–WSi2 coating on pure Ni and its oxidation performance under cyclic heating and cooling conditions in air at 900, 1100 and 1300°C have been studied. The coating was applied by laser cladding process. The microstructure evaluations demonstrated that a uniform free cracks coating formed which was metallurgically bonded to the substrate. XRD and EDS analysis results showed that the coating consisted of CoWSi, WSi2 and γ-Co. The mass gain/unit area versus oxidation time plot for all the samples was parabolic indicating that the oxidation process was diffusion-controlled. The structure of scales depended on oxidation temperatures; at 900°C, a dense scale layer consisting of SiO2 and small amounts of WO3 and CoO, at 1100°C, a characteristic scale structure, namely a mixed layer structure and at 1300°C, the dense oxide scale enrichment of SiO2 and porous interdiffusion layer with low oxygen concentration was formed.","Zarezadeh Mehrizi, M.;Shamanian, M.;Saidi, A.;Shoja-Razazvi, R.;Beigi, R.",2015-09-30,Ceramics International,"Laser cladding,CoWSi–WSi2 coating,Cyclic oxidation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.04.041,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.04.041
Thermal stability and oxidation resistance of V-alloyed TiAlN coatings,"V-containing nitride coatings recently attract a wide range of research interests owing to their excellent tribological properties. To evaluate their comprehensive properties, a comparative study on the intrinsic thermal stability and oxidation resistance of TiAlN and TiAlVN coatings are conducted here. Ti0.56Al0.44N, Ti0.50Al0.44V0.06N, and Ti0.40Al0.50V0.10N coatings, deposited by cathodic arc evaporation, exhibit a single-phase face-centered cubic structure with a hardness of 28.9–29.8GPa. The V-containing coatings show a pronounced age-hardening upon annealing, which contributes to a hardness increase of 3.7 and 4.8GPa at 800°C for Ti0.50Al0.44V0.06N and Ti0.40Al0.50V0.10N, respectively, corresponding to 2.9GPa for Ti0.56Al0.44N. Also, alloying with V retards the formation of wurtzite AlN upon annealing, especially in Ti0.50Al0.44V0.06N, and thus contributes to a higher hardness above 30GPa even annealing at 1100°C, while the hardness of Ti0.56Al0.44N significantly reduces to 27.8 ± 0.6GPa. However, alloying with V into TiAlN leads to an earlier formation of rutile TiO2 and also Ti-rich oxide top-layer on the outside surface instead of dense Al2O3, and thus degrades the oxidation resistance. When exposed to air at 700°C for 10h, the Ti0.50Al0.44V0.06N and Ti0.40Al0.50V0.10N coatings suffer from a severe oxidation, whereas only a compact oxide scale with a thickness of ~ 80nm for Ti0.56Al0.44N is formed.","Xu, Yu X.;Chen, Li;Pei, Fei;Yue, Jian L.;Du, Yong",2018-02-01,Ceramics International,"Films,TiAlVN,Hardness,Thermal properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.100,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.100
Polymer derived gel-like preceramic precursor of core-shell silicon oxycarbide ceramic for robocasting,"The conventional techniques for 3D printing ceramic parts are the ceramic powder laser sintering and lithography process that are usually costly in equipment and materials. A low-cost technique for robocasting ceramic has been developed via polysilazane preceramic precursor incorporated with nano γ-alumina powders to form a gel-like preceramic precursor with the aim to be used as the raw material for robocasting ceramic parts. The gel-like preceramic precursor is simply extruded for shaping by CAD design with the self-incorporated robocasting machine, and then pyrolyzed the shaped gel-like preceramic precursor at 700, 850 and 950 °C, respectively to transform from a polymeric composite to core-shell silicon oxycarbide ceramic composite that has been characterized by XRD representing an amorphous silicon oxycarbonitride structure coating on the surface of nano γ-alumina. The Vickers hardness of the core-shell silicon oxycarbide ceramic is about HV 266–300 that is two times higher than that of 7000 series aluminum alloy.","Hu, Lung-Hao;Wang, Yu-Kai;Wang, Sheng-Chang",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Robocasting,Gel-like preceramic precursor,Core-shell silicon oxycarbide ceramic,Polysilazane precursor",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.053,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.053
Carbon-coated Li2S cathode for improving the electrochemical properties of an all-solid-state lithium-sulfur battery using Li2S-P2S5 solid electrolyte,"Li2S is coated with carbon to improve the electrical conductivity of the composite cathode in all-solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries. Carbon is applied by thermal evaporation from a polyacrylonitrile (PAN) source at 600°C for 5h. It is shown that the carbon coating is impurity free, and the crystallinity of Li2S is well maintained. The electronic conductivity of Li2S is dramatically improved from 9.21 × 10−9 Scm−1 to 2.39 × 10−2 Scm−1 upon carbon coating. An all-solid-state battery prepared with the carbon-coated Li2S shows a high initial capacity of 585mAhg−1 (g of Li2S) that increases up to 730mAhg−1 (g of carbon-coated Li2S) by the 10th cycle. This high capacity is stable throughout the 25 cycles tested, with an excellent coulombic efficiency of 99%. Carbon-coated Li2S is advantageous for all-solid-state batteries due to the increased electrical conductivity, while allowing a reduction of the total carbon content present in the composite cathode.","Choi, Sunho;Yoon, Insang;Nichols, William T.;Shin, Dongwook",2018-05-31,Ceramics International,"Solid electrolyte,Lithium sulfide,Lithium sulfur battery,Carbon coating,All-solid-state battery",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.104,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.104
"Study of the structure, properties, scratch resistance and deformation behaviour of graded Cr-CrN-Cr(1-x)AlxN coatings","An in-depth investigation of the structure, properties, scratch adhesion characteristics of graded Cr-CrN-Cr(1-x)AlxN coatings synthesized onto M42 steel substrates using closed – field unbalanced magnetron sputtering (CFUBMS) was carried out. Advanced microscopy (scanning and transmission electron microscopy), focused ion beam (FIB) imaging, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and micro–scratch tests was used to investigate the microstructure, mechanical properties and scratch performance as a function of Al content. FIB and TEM investigations revealed that the coatings exhibited a distinct structure; i.e., an adhesive Cr layer, a CrN transition layer and a graded CrAlN top layer with a face centered cubic (FCC) B1 structure. A columnar morphology was exhibited by the coatings and the dimensions of the columnar grains decreased with increasing Al content. Residual stress measurements, obtained from the XRD – sin2ψ method, revealed increasing compressive stresses with increasing Al content. Furthermore, nanoindentation tests showed an increase in mechanical properties, fracture toughness index (H/E) and plastic deformation resistance (H3/E2) as the Al content increased, accompanied by a decrease in the critical load, LC, during scratch testing implying a decrease in scratch toughness.","Kabir, Mohammad Sharear;Munroe, Paul;Zhou, Zhifeng;Xie, Zonghan",2018-07-31,Ceramics International,"Graded coatings,Unbalanced magnetron sputtering,Plastic deformation resistance (H3/E2),Nanoindentation,Adhesion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.187,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.187
Influence of total pressure on the microstructures and growth mechanism of ZrC coatings prepared by chemical vapor deposition from the Zr-Br2-C3H6-H2-Ar system,"Zirconium carbide (ZrC) coatings were deposited on graphite substrates by chemical vapor deposition from the Zr-Br2-C3H6-H2-Ar system. The influence of total pressure on the growth of ZrC was investigated in the range of 5–60kPa. As the total pressure increased, the deposition rate increased evidently, and the preferential orientation of ZrC coatings changed from the (200) plane to the (220) plane. The growth mechanism changed from a mass transport reaction to a surface reaction at the total pressure of 20–40kPa. At the total pressure below 20kPa, the deposition was dominated by crystal growth, so the coatings were composed of well-faceted pyramidal-shaped crystals growing along the <001> direction. At the total pressure above 60kPa, the growth of ZrC coatings was controlled by the nucleation mechanism, so the coatings were cluster-like crystals rapidly growing along the <110> direction. In addition, low pressure was conducive to the formation of near-stoichiometric ZrC without free carbon. These variations of ZrC coatings can mainly be attributed to gas supersaturation and remarkably changed transport diffusion coefficients with increasing total pressure.","Ma, Xin;Chen, Si’an;Mei, Min;Li, Yong;Hu, Haifeng;He, Xinbo;Li, Guangde;Qu, Xuanhui",2017-03-31,Ceramics International,"ZrC coating,Ultra-high temperature ceramic,Total pressure,Chemical vapor deposition,Microstructure,Growth mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.172,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.172
"Chemical solution deposition of pure and Gd-doped ceria thin films: Structural, morphological and optical properties","High quality smooth, uniform and crack-free ceria and gadolinium doped ceria (GDC) thin films were prepared on Si and Si/YSZ substrates by chemical solution deposition. The thermal behavior of Gd-Ce-O precursor was investigated by TG-DSC measurements. The phase purity and structure of deposited films were evaluated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and Raman spectroscopy. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were employed for the estimation of surface morphological features. Oxidation state of Ce ions in fabricated films was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Optical properties were evaluated by diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectrometry. Thickness of the films can be controlled by applying a certain number of spin coating cycles. A linear relation between the thickness of the films and the number of deposited layers was observed. The single-layer thickness was determined to be approximately 20nm. The influence of annealing temperature and Gd content on the film structure, morphology and optical properties was studied and discussed. The dependence of an optical band gap as a function of grain size was demonstrated.","Zarkov, Aleksej;Stanulis, Andrius;Mikoliunaite, Lina;Katelnikovas, Arturas;Jasulaitiene, Vitalija;Ramanauskas, Rimantas;Tautkus, Stasys;Kareiva, Aivaras",2017-04-01,Ceramics International,"A.

On the role of TGO growth in the interface undulation in MCrAlY coating system upon thermal cycling,"The bond-coat/TGO (thermally grown oxide) interface has been experimentally observed to progressively undulate upon thermal cycling. This work presents a study on the role of TGO growth in the interface undulation. An axisymmetric finite element model was built based on the ratcheting phenomenon. It is found that the interface undulation is associated with not only the compressive stresses in the TGO but also the softness of the bond-coat. The compressive stresses provide the driving force for the interface undulation. At high temperature, lengthening TGO growth is responsible for the compressive stresses and therefore plays a crucial role in the interface undulation. The bond-coat needs to be soft enough to accommodate the interface undulation. Thickening TGO growth itself almost has no effect on the interface undulation, but the variation of TGO thickness appears to affect the sensitivity of the interface undulation to the lengthening strain rate of TGO growth.","Cen, L.;Qin, W.Y.;Yu, Q.M.",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"thermal cycling,TGO growth,Interface undulation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.322,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.322
Failure mode analysis of carbide cutting tools used for machining titanium alloy,"Intensive research on the performance of coated carbide tools in machining titanium alloy is being conducted worldwide. Titanium alloy has special characteristics such as high strength at elevated temperature and high mechanical resistance that makes carbide tools suitable to cut this material. This is because carbide tools are classified as hard and highly resistant to wear even at high temperature. This paper discusses the failure mode of a coated carbide cutting edge that is caused by the loading and unloading effect during milling. Tool failure adversely affects tool life, the quality of the machined surface and the surface's dimensional accuracy, and consequently the economics of cutting operations. The milling parameters that were observed to affect the failure of coated carbide tools were cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut, and the application of a cutting fluid. Wear occurred along the flank and rake faces, which then propagated into the substrate material after the removal of the coating material. Wear along the flank and rake faces led to the concentration of stress over a certain area of the cutting edge, which was initiated by a microcrack and then propagated due to the loading and unloading effect during the intermittent milling process until significant brittle fracture occurred in the substrate material. Cutting speed and depth of cut were identified as the main factors responsible for the failure and fatigue of the coated carbide tools during the milling of titanium alloy.","A.

Oxidation protective MoSi2-SiC-Si coating for graphite materials prepared by slurry dipping and vapor silicon infiltration,"A novel kind of dense MoSi2-SiC-Si coating was prepared on the surface of graphite substrate by slurry dipping and vapor silicon infiltration process. Mo-SiC-C precoating was fabricated via slurry dipping method, and then MoSi2-SiC-Si coating with dense structure consisting of Si, MoSi2 and SiC was obtained by vapor silicon infiltration process. The isothermal oxidation tests at temperatures from 800 to 1600°C and TGA test from room temperature to 1500°C were used to evaluate the oxidation resistance ability of the MoSi2-SiC-Si coating. The experimental results indicate that the prepared coating has good oxidation protection ability at a wide temperature range from room temperature to 1600°C. Meanwhile, the oxidation of the coated samples is a weight gain process at temperatures from 800 to 1500°C due to the formed SiO2 layer on the surface of coating. After oxidation for 220h at 1600°C, the weight loss of the coated sample was only 0.96%, which is considered to be the excessive consumption of the outer coating and the appearance of defects in the coating. Two layers can be observed in the coating after oxidation, namely, SiO2 layer and MoSi2-SiC-Si layer.","Jiang, Yan;Ye, Chaochao;Ru, Hongqiang;Wang, Wei;Zhang, Cuiping;Yue, Xinyan",2018-04-01,Ceramics International,"Graphite,Oxidation resistance,MoSi2-SiC-Si coating,Vapor silicon infiltration",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.122,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.122
Rolling contact fatigue behavior of Ti/TiN coated ADI by cathodic arc deposition,"This work studies the rolling contact fatigue (RCF) behavior of austempered ductile iron samples coated with Ti/TiN by cathodic arc deposition. The influence of the TiN layer thickness on the characteristics and RCF life of the coated samples is analyzed. RCF tests were performed in a flat washer type testing rig, using a thrust ball bearing as a counterpart. The maximum contact pressure was 1400MPa. RCF tests results were analyzed using the two-parameter Weibull distribution. The rolling track of the tested samples was examined by using SEM and EDS. The results show that the surface hardness, residual stresses and coating adhesion strength of the samples increase as TiN layer thickness increases while surface roughness, coating hardness and elastic modulus do not vary significantly with the TiN layer thickness. Regarding the RCF tests, two failure mechanisms were observed in the coated samples, coating delamination and substrate spalling. Coating delamination turned out to be the most predominant mechanism and occurred at fewer loading cycles than substrate spalling. The EDS analysis revealed that inside the delaminated areas the Ti interlayer remained adhered to the substrates in all the cases. Extended tests on delaminated samples show growing delamination until final failure by substrate spalling occurred. The Weibull analysis indicates that the RCF life of the coated samples seems to have a tendency to increase with the TiN layer thickness and, in the case of the thicker TiN layer, to exceed the life of uncoated ADI after the extended tests. However, due to the number of samples employed, the statistic analysis does not show significant differences in the RCF behavior of the uncoated and coated samples.","Colombo, Diego Alejandro;Massone, Juan Miguel;Echeverría, María Dolores;Márquez, Adriana Beatriz",2017-04-01,Ceramics International,"Austempered ductile iron,Physical vapor deposition,Cathodic arc deposition,TiN,Ti interlayer,Rolling contact fatigue",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.068,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.068
Fabrication and dry cutting performance of Si3N4/TiC ceramic tools reinforced with the PVD WS2/Zr soft-coatings,"WS2/Zr soft-coatings were deposited on Si3N4/TiC ceramic cutting tools by medium-frequency magnetron sputtering together with multi-arc ion plating. Microstructural and fundamental properties of the coatings were examined and dry cutting tests on hardened steel were carried out. The cutting performance and wear characteristic of the coated tools were investigated compared with uncoated tool. Results show that the WS2/Zr coated Si3N4/TiC cutting tools significantly improve the lubricity at the tool–chip interface; the cutting force, cutting temperature, friction coefficient and tool wear are reduced and the tool life is increased compared with uncoated tool. Crater wear and flank wear occurred both on uncoated and coated tools. Abrasive wear, adhesions and chipping are the predominant wear mechanisms of uncoated tool on crater wear and flank wear; abrasive wear, coating delamination and chipping are the main wear mechanisms of WS2/Zr coated tools. Friction-reduction and increased wear-resistance are attributed to the formation of a transfer lubricant layer at the tool–chip interface during the dry cutting process.","Xing, Youqiang;Deng, Jianxin;Zhang, Kedong;Wang, Xingsheng;Lian, Yunsong;Zhou, Yonghui",2015-09-30,Ceramics International,"C.

After that, the coated samples were heat-treated using a Nd:YAG laser. Then, the microstructures of the conventional and nanostructured TBCs before and after the laser glazing process were examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The coating phases were studied by X-ray diffractometry (XRD). The high-temperature corrosion behavior of the nanostructured plasma sprayed coating in the presence of Vanadium pentoxide and Sodium sulfate molten salt was compared with that of the conventional coatings before and after laser treatment at 1050 °C. The hot corrosion results showed that the coatings had a similar degradation mechanism based on which the corrosive molten salt reacted with the stabilizer of YSZ, producing hot corrosion products such as YVO4. It led to an unwanted phase transformation from tetragonal (t) to monoclinic (m) Zirconia and the final degradation of the TBC system. However, reducing molten salt penetration, decreasing surface roughness and, reduction of the specific surface area are three important mechanisms that improved hot corrosion resistance, finally extending the lifetime of the glazed samples. The results also showed that the nanostructured TBC had higher hot corrosion resistance in comparison with other samples.","Pakseresht, A.H.;Kimiayi, A.;Alizadeh, M.;Nuranian, H.;Faeghinia, A.",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"TBCs,Nanostructured,Laser glazing,Molten salt,Hot corrosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.259,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.259
TiC/Ti3AlC2–Co plasma-sprayed coatings with excellent high-temperature tribological properties,"In this work, TiC/Ti3AlC2–Co cermet coatings with varying amounts of Ti3AlC2 were deposited by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) process and their wear-resistant properties were discussed. The friction coefficients and wear rates at high-temperatures were measured through a ball-on-disk type friction test at 600 °C. In addition, the corresponding wear mechanisms were elucidated through the observation of phase changes and surface microstructural evolution of the coatings. The results indicated that the as-prepared coatings consisted of TiC, Ti, TiO2, Al2O3, Co and CoO phases, which were produced by the decomposition and oxidation of TiC and Ti3AlC2. Compared with other samples, the sample with 30 wt% Ti3AlC2 addition displayed the smallest friction coefficient and least wear rate. Its wear rate was about 1.26 times lower than that of reported TiC–Co cermet material and about 10 times lower than that of the typically used TiC–Ni cermet material, suggesting outstanding wear resistance at elevated temperature. The addition of Ti3AlC2 reduced the friction coefficient of the coating by producing more TiC and Al2O3 hard phases and a consequent reduction of coating porosity. When the amount of Ti3AlC2 in the coating was less than 30 wt%, the main wear mechanism was abrasive wear. As the content of Ti3AlC2 was increased in the coating, the wear mechanism changed from abrasive wear to adhesive wear and the wear pattern of the coating gradually transformed from the furrows to the debris. This transformation of mechanism was related to the synergistic effect of hardness and porosity of the coating, which resulted from the remaining content and the special layered structure of Ti3AlC2.","Chen, Hongfei;Du, Yaxiong;Wang, Duojin;Zhang, Chi;Yang, Guang;Liu, Bin;Gao, Yanfeng;Shi, Suilin",2018-12-15,Ceramics International,"TiC/Ti3AlC2–Co cermet coatings,High-temperature wear resistance,Plasma spraying,Wear mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.023
Application of SiC particles coated with a protective Ni layer for production of Ni/SiC co-electrodeposited composite coatings with enhanced tribological properties,"In this paper, the mechanical properties of composites consisting of electroplated Ni and co-electrodeposited SiC particles, coated with a thin protective layer of Ni, were studied. The protective layer was on the SiC particles prior to adding them to the electrolyte bath. It was demonstrated that due to the application of the protective layer it was possible to decrease sliding friction force, and improve the wear resistance, of the composite coatings in comparison with standard electroplated composite coatings made of Ni and co-electrodeposited pure SiC particles. Coating SiC particles with Ni was achieved by means of a PVD process. The main advantage of this step is avoiding oxidation of the surface of the particles during the contact with an electrolyte. Particles protected from oxidation lead to stronger interfacial bonding between the matrix and the reinforcement. Furthermore, better bonding protects the SiC particles from being extracted from the matrix by a counter-probe during friction and wear tests. The influence of the particle's concentration is studied. A smaller friction force and constant wear rate was observed.","Jenczyk, Piotr;Gawrońska, Małgorzata;Dera, Wojciech;Chrzanowska-Giżyńska, Justyna;Denis, Piotr;Jarząbek, Dariusz M.",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Wear,Friction,Interfacial bonding strength,Metal matrix composites,Silicon carbide,Electrodeposited nickel",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.063,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.063
The effect of metal coatings on the interfacial bonding strength of ceramics to copper in sintered Cu-SiC composites,"Cu-SiC composites are very promising materials which have high thermal and electrical conductivity and may find many applications. Unfortunately, the main disadvantage of these materials is the dissolution of silicon in copper at elevated temperature, which significantly reduces their properties. In order to overcome this problem particles can be coated with a protective material before sintering. In this paper– the influence of three different metallic coatings on bonding strength were investigated. SiC particles were coated with tungsten, chromium or titanium. As reference a material with uncoated particles was prepared. The experiments were carried out with the use of microtensile tester. The highest increase in strength was observed in the case of chromium coating. On the other hand, the titanium coating, which was of very poor quality, decrease the bonding strength in comparison with uncoated particles. Furthermore, scanning electron and optical microscopes were used to determine the mechanism of debonding.","Jarząbek, Dariusz M.;Milczarek, Michał;Wojciechowski, Tomasz;Dziekoński, Cezary;Chmielewski, Marcin",2017-04-15,Ceramics International,"Interfacial bonding strength,Metal matrix composites,Tensile strength,Silicon carbide particles",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.01.056,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.01.056
Sol-infiltrated multilayer SiC/yttrium silicate coatings for imparting enhanced oxidation resistance to C-SiC composites,"Yttrium silicate coatings are applied on C-SiC composites for advanced aerospace structural applications at high temperatures. The Air Plasma Spray (APS) method is widely used for the deposition of yttrium silicate coatings. However, the oxidation resistance offered by the APS-deposited coating is limited by the inherent porosity and micro-cracks in the coating. The present study demonstrates the effective sealing of the pores and micro-cracks in the APS coating by impregnation with yttrium silicate sol followed by sintering at 1400 °C. The cyclic oxidation behavior is comparatively assessed at 1300 and 1500 °C in air for the C-SiC composite samples applied with multilayer coatings comprising combinations of CVD SiC/APS yttrium silicate/sol infiltrated yttrium silicate coatings. The lone SiC coated and the SiC/APS yttrium silicate coated samples exhibited rapid decrease in weight. On the contrary, the SiC/APS coated samples infiltrated with yttrium silicate sol exhibited significantly improved oxidation resistance. The weight loss during oxidation was prevented after infiltration of the yttrium silicate sol at a higher vacuum level of 1 mbar, which effected in better healing of the pores in the APS coating and formation of a dense yttrium silicate scale on the surface.","Rani, I.

Selection and application of wear-resistant materials to increase service life of components,"The approach to erosion and wear testing is discussed, emphasizing the set-up of test methods to allow reliable experimental data of technological usefulness to be obtained. Case histories regarding testing in simulative conditions and applications of advanced ceramics, surface treatments and coatings are presented. The high potential of new materials, surface treatments and coatings to reduce wear damage has been demonstrated through several laboratory and field tests.","Martinella, R.",1993-12-31,Ceramics International, ,10.1016/0272-8842(93)90027-O,https://doi.org/10.1016/0272-8842(93)90027-O
Improved Li–S batteries obtained by using multifunctional separators modified with vapor grown carbon Fiber/MoS2 composites,"Li–S battery is considered as one of the most competitive energy storage devices mainly due to the high theoretical specific capacity and high specific energy. However, when facing with the practical application, some issues, especially poor electro-conductivity of element sulfur and severe polysulfides (LiPSs) migration, are still needed to solve to further improve the performance of the Li–S batteries. Aiming at the above two disadvantages, in this work, multifunctional separators are designed as efficient LiPSs absorber via coating vapor grown carbon fiber/MoS2 (VGCF/MoS2) composites on the polypropylene separator (PP) near the cathode side. For the as-prepared VGCF/MoS2 coated polypropylene separator (VM/PP), MoS2 could provide strong chemical adsorption for the LiPSs, while the VGCF framework could act as an electronic transmission channel for the conversion of LiPSs, and also provide physical adsorption for LiPSs at the same time. Benefit from these characteristics, the batteries with VM/PP exhibits a high initial capacity of 1208.7 mAh g−1 at 0.2C and maintains at 862.4 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles. Impressively, the VM/PP shows the high specific capacity of 904.3 mAh g−1 and long-lasting cycling stability with 0.03% capacity attenuation per cycle over 600 cycles at 1.0C, demonstrating excellent electrochemical performance.","Wang, Rui;Li, Jing;Zhang, Ying;Li, Pengyu;Duan, Jidong;Tang, Manqin;Yuan, Chun",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"Li–S batteries,VGCF/MoS2,Polysulfide barrier,Surface modification,Shuttle effect",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.284,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.284
Synthesis and application of titania-coated ultrafine diamond abrasive particles,"In order to improve the oxidation resistance of ultrafine diamonds (UFDs) and broaden their applications in the field of ultra-precision grinding, titania-coated UFDs were prepared successfully with the aid of acetic acid and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Compared with the pristine UFDs, the oxidation resistance temperature of titania-coated UFDs was enhanced by around 130°C. The titania shell thickness was approximately 4nm. The hydrolysis rate of titania precursors was controlled effectively, and a mass of isolated titania particles were not formed when pH value of the system was about 5.0. The amphiphilic PVP could be adsorbed easily on the surface of UFDs and subsequently combine with the hydroxyl groups of hydrolyzed TiO2 particles, which stimulated the formation of titania-coated UFDs. In addition, titania-coated UFD-vitrified bond wheels were manufactured through the titania-coated UFD-vitrified bond composite powders obtained by a polyacrylamide gel (P-G) method, with which their mechanical performances were largely improved. These results would provide a new pathway of manufacturing high-quality ultra-precision grinding wheels.","Miao, Weipeng;Yan, Ning;Zhao, Yucheng;Liu, Mingyao;Li, Yapeng;Wang, Liping;Zou, Qin;Tang, Hu;Qiao, Lina;Wang, Mingzhi",2016-05-15,Ceramics International,"Coating,Ultrafine diamond,Ultra-precision,Oxidation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.02.139,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.02.139
Microstructure and mechanical properties of alumina 5vol% zirconia nanocomposites prepared by powder coating and powder mixing routes,"Zirconia toughened alumina (ZTA) nanocomposites are attractive structural materials which combine the high hardness and Young's modulus of the alumina matrix with an additional toughening effect by the zirconia dispersion. In this study two approaches to prepare ZTA are compared. For the first approach, an ultrafine alumina powder was coated with 5vol% zirconia by a wet chemical method. For the second one, the reference material was prepared by intensively mixing and milling the same alumina with nanoscale zirconia powder. Samples were consolidated at 1350–1600°C by hot pressing and their mechanical properties, microstructure and transformation behavior were compared. Toughness increments derived from different toughening mechanisms are also briefly discussed. Besides better sinterability, the mixed material exhibited a finer grain size of both matrix and dispersion and thus higher hardness and strength. The alumina matrix was under compressive hydrostatic residual cooling stress, whereas zirconia was under tensile one. The coated material, however, showed higher transformability, deeper transformation zones and thus higher fracture toughness. In addition, it contained more monoclinic zirconia so the matrix was under tension.","Kern, Frank;Palmero, Paola",2013-01-31,Ceramics International,"B. Microstructure-final,C.

"Progress of ceramic research in the Shanghai Institute of ceramics, Academia Sinica","Research activities in the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences started in the early fifties after the founding of the People's Republic of China. The Institute is now an establishment devoted essentially to studies of inorganic materials with a broad spectrum of research projects relating to single crystal studies, glass (amorphous material) research, oxide and non-oxide ceramics research, ferroics studies, fast-ion conductor research, inorganic coating materials studies and research on ancient Chinese porcelain and glazes. Problems concerned with processing, characterization, microstructure and properties are involved. Other major branches of ceramic science and engineering are being studied in other institutions run by the Building Materials, Light Industries and Metallurgy Departments of the Government and some Universities and Institutions of Technology.

Resistance to intense electron beam bombardment of TiC/Graphite: Numerical modeling and experimental investigation,"Resistance to intense electron beam bombardment of TiC/Graphite was investigated numerically and experimentally. The results indicate that the decreasing of initial electron energy and the increasing of TiC coating thickness could both enhance the electron energy deposition inside the surface layer of the TiC/Graphite, and finally cause the increasement of the temperature differences at the interface between TiC coating and graphite substrate. The graphite substrate is well coated with TiC in all the TiC/graphite targets, and the morphology of the TiC coatings could be controlled by adjusting its thickness. Under electron beam with accelerating voltage of 850 keV, current of 11 kA, pulsewidth of 40 ns and pulse number of 30 times, TiC/Graphite target with TiC coating thickness of 1 μm shows more excellent electron beam bombardment resistance, agreeing with the results of the numerical modeling.","Chen, Changhua;Tang, Yunsheng;Liu, Wenyuan;Cheng, Jun;Ke, Changfeng;Huo, Yankun;Wu, Ping;Ni, Jianzhong",2020-08-19,Ceramics International,"Graphite,Electron beam bombardment,TiC coating,Modeling,Energy deposition,Electron damage",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.141,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.141
Fabrication and cytotoxicity assessment of novel polysiloxane/bioactive glass films for biomedical applications,"This work evaluates for the first time the cyto-compatibility of silicone (polysiloxane)/bioactive glass composite films produced by dip coating on stainless steel substrates using osteoblast-like (MG-63) cells. With the aim of creating corrosion resistant coatings for biomedical applications, bioactive glass (BG) of 45S5 composition was used as a filler in conjunction with commercial silicones (MK and H62C). Bioactive glass has the property of forming a direct bond to living bone, and polysiloxane is an attractive candidate for protective coatings due to its resistance to oxidation and corrosion. Suspensions based on polysiloxanes (MK/H62C) and micro-sized BG fillers were used for dip coating stainless steel substrates at room temperature, followed by curing in oxidative atmosphere at 260°C and 500°C. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis revealed the presence of Si–O–Si, Si–OR, Si–CH3 and Si–OH groups on the substrate. Field emission scanning electron microscopy showed that the coatings were homogeneous with no obvious cracks or pinholes at relatively high concentrations of both polysiloxane and BG. The cell biology experiments confirmed that the expressed cell-morphology, analyzed on chosen surfaces, was pheno-typical for MG-63 cells after 48h of incubation. On the film containing the lower amount of polysiloxane/BG the most dense cell layer was formed. Our results indicated that polysiloxane/BG composite films exhibited good cyto-compatibility at 260°C and 500°C and showed no toxicity toward MG-63 cells suggesting the potential of this composite for applications in medical implants.","Francis, A.;Detsch, R.;Boccaccini, A.R.",2016-11-01,Ceramics International,"Silicones,Bioactive glasses,Composite coatings,Cytotoxicity,Polymer-derived ceramics,Polysiloxane,Silicon oxycarbide,FTIR",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.195,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.195
"Composition, mechanical properties and thermal cycling performance of YSZ toughened La2Ce2O7 composite thermal barrier coatings","Poor fracture toughness of La2Ce2O7 (LC) seriously prevents its practical applications as thermal barrier coatings. In this study, 8 wt% yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) was introduced to toughen the plasma-sprayed LC coatings. The mechanical performance, thermophysical properties and thermal shock resistance of the coatings were improved significantly, although a solid solution reaction between LC and YSZ occurred during spraying. For instance, the toughness, adhesion and thermal conductivity at 1273 K for 20 mol% YSZ doped LC coating achieved ~1.25 MPa·m1/2, ~60 MPa and ~0.49 W/(m·K), respectively. Moreover, the thermal contraction was suppressed effectively. The enhanced toughness could be attributed to the increased fracture energy resulted from the reaction of LC with YSZ. The chipping spallation, caused by the high thermal stress as well as low fracture toughness, appeared within the ceramic top coat near the bond coat during cycling. These findings lay a theoretical foundation for the toughening of brittle coatings.","Zhang, Hao;Yuan, Jieyan;Song, Wenjia;Zhou, Xin;Dong, Shujuan;Duo, Shuwang;Wang, Jinshuang;Yang, Xiong;Jiang, Jianing;Deng, Longhui;Huang, Jingqi;Cao, Xueqiang",2020-04-01,Ceramics International,"La2Ce2O7,Toughening,Fracture energy,Failure mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.152,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.152
Mechanical and histological evaluation of a plasma sprayed hydroxyapatite coating on a titanium bond coat,"To improve the biological stability of hydroxyapatite-coated implants, the use of an appropriate commercial pure titanium bond coat (CP-Ti) is an effective method for significant improvement in the interface bonding and stress reduction of the plasma-sprayed HA coating and Ti-alloy system. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of plasma-sprayed CP-Ti on the in vivo properties of the HA coating on Ti6Al4V. According to the experimental results, samples with an HA coating on the CP-Ti (Ti-HA coating) display a lower and ineffective residual stress than samples without the bond coat. The CP-Ti provides a very rough surface and results in a higher adhesive strength between the HA and CP-Ti. In the in vivo test, after the intramedullary implantation, the histological observation showed the apposition of the new bone tissue directly onto the HA coating. The shear strength between the bone and the Ti-HA coating was higher than that without CP-Ti after 12 weeks of implantation (5.15 vs. 1.41MPa). The failure mode analysis showed the failure mainly occurring at the surrounding bone, with some failure at the HA/CP-Ti interface. The excellent bio-durability and mechanical properties of the HA coating in this study contributed to the reduction of the compressive residual stress in the HA coating and to the enhancement of interface adhesive strength by introducing the commercial pure titanium bond coat.","Yang, Yung-Chin;Yang, Chyun-Yu",2013-08-31,Ceramics International,"Plasma spray,Residual stress,Hydroxyapatite,Bond coat",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.01.083,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.01.083
Analysis of structure and microhardness of Al2O3-40 wt.% TiO2/NiCoCrAl gradient coating with in-situ needle-like phase reinforcement after high-temperature treatment,"This study investigated the structural evolution and microhardness of Al2O3–40 wt.% TiO2/NiCoCrAl gradient coatings deposited by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) after high-temperature treatment carried out at 800 °C in air for 600 h. The gradient region exhibited a different ceramic growth and oxidation behaviour at different zones. The nonhomogeneous needle-like γ-Al2O3 phase was formed at the ceramic region, whereas the homogeneous needle-like NiAl2O4 phase was formed at the NiCoCrAl oxidation region close to the ceramic coating. And the ingrowth Cr-rich phase existed inside the NiCoCrAl splats at the gradient region close to the bond coating. An obviously microhardness improvement of the coating can be measured by a Vickers microhardness tester. The formation of the needle-like phase has an effect on the reinforcement of coating.","He, Xuan;Yuan, Xiaohu;Xu, Hao;Song, Peng;Yu, Xiao;Li, Chao;Huang, Taihong;Li, Qiaolei;Lü, Kaiyue;Feng, Jing;Lü, Jianguo;Lu, Jiansheng",2019-08-15,Ceramics International,"Gradient coating,Al2O3,TiO2,NiCoCrAl,Microhardness",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.171,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.171
Dispersion and microwave processing of nano-sized ITO powder for the fabrication of transparent conductive oxides,"Aqueous dispersions of tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) nanopowder were prepared and the effect of the addition of PEG 400, Tween 80 and β-alanine as dispersants was investigated using zeta potential and particle size distribution measurements. Both PEG 400 and β-alanine were found to produce stable dispersions that were used to deposit ITO thin films on glass substrates by dip and spin coating methods. The ITO thin films were heat-treated using both conventional and microwave heat treatment in order to improve the inter-particle connections and hence the resistivity and transparency of the films. All the films exhibited an average transmittance of >80% over the visible spectrum after being subjected to the heat treatment process. ITO films prepared with no dispersant showed very high resistivity values for both heating methods, however addition of 2wt% PEG 400 to the dispersion yielded a reduction in the resistivity values to 1.4×10−1 Ωcm and 3.8×10−2 Ωcm for conventionally and microwave treated films, respectively. The surface morphological studies confirmed that addition of dispersants improved the film uniformity and inter-particle connections of the ITO films considerably.","Ghanizadeh, S.;Peiris, T.A.

Synthesis and characterization of novel nontoxic BiFe1−xAlxO3/mica-titania pigments with high NIR reflectance,"A series of novel nontoxic near-infrared (NIR) reflective pigments based on Al-doped BiFeO3 coated mica-titania were synthesized by precipitation combined with sol-gel method. The pigments of the formula BiFe1−xAlxO3/mica-titania (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) were characterized by XRD, FE-SEM, TG-DTA, UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer and CIE L* a* b* color scales. The results illustrate that the BiFeO3 nanoparticles are coated on the surface of mica-titania uniformly, and the doped BiFe1−xAlxO3/mica-titania is similar to BiFeO3/mica-titania composite in morphology. Furthermore, the absorption edge of composite pigments shift to shorter wavelength (533–495nm) can be attributed to O2p-Fe3d charge transfer transitions and change the color of the pigments from brown to orange. Additionally, the NIR solar reflectance of the powdered pigments and pigmented coatings were measured. The results reveal that with the increase of progressive doping of Al3+ for Fe3+, the NIR solar reflectance of the pigments increase gradually and exhibit higher NIR solar reflectance (R* ≥ 47.8%) than the conventional pigment of similar color. Moreover, we also evaluated the thermal and chemical stability of the pigments. In conclusion, the pigments have the potential to be applied as “cool pigments”.","Yuan, Lin;Han, Aijun;Ye, Mingquan;Chen, Xingxing;Ding, Cheng;Yao, Lingyun",2017-12-15,Ceramics International,"BiFe1−xAlxO3,Composite pigment,Nontoxic,NIR reflectance,Cool pigments",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.032,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.032
Evaluation of nanoalumina coated germanium black polyimide membrane as sunshield for application on the communication satellite antenna,"Alumina thin coatings were grown on Germanium (Ge) coated black polyimide (GBP) or Kapton which has been used as a sunshield membrane on communication satellite antennas to protect it from environmental degradation during ground storage and implementation.

Space worthiness of the coating was examined by simulated environments, e.g. humidity, thermal cycling and thermovacuum tests. No degradation was observed in its microstructural, thermo-optical, electrical, chemical state and RF characteristic in particular Ku and Ka bands.

Mullite whisker-mullite/yttrium aluminosilicate oxidation protective coatings for SiC coated C/C composites,"A novel mullite whisker-mullite/yttrium aluminosilicate coating was designed and prepared through a three-step process including molten salt, supersonic atmospheric plasma spraying and sol-hot dipping. The mullite whiskers were used to enhance the interface bonding between mullite and SiC layer. A dense yttrium aluminosilicate outer coating was employed to seal the microholes in mullite coating. Results show that the bonding strength of the as-prepared coating was enhanced and the coating present a dense and crack-free microstructure. After 30 thermal-shock cycles from 1773 K to room temperature and oxidized for 185 h in atmospheric environment at 1773 K, the coated sample was only at a weight loss of 1.08% and 1.58%, respectively.","Zhou, Lei;Fu, Qiangang;Huo, Caixia;Tong, Mingde;Liu, Xuesong;Hu, Dou",2019-12-15,Ceramics International,"C/C composites,Mullite whisker,Thermal-shock resistance,Oxidation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.105,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.105
Microstructure and anti-erosion property of SiC coated 2D C/C composites by chemical vapor reaction,"A SiC erosion resistance coating was prepared on 2D carbon/carbon (C/C) composites by chemical vapor reaction (CVR). The microstructure and anti-erosion property of SiC coated C/C composites prepared from 1873 to 2173K were investigated. It is found that the coatings were mainly composed of β-SiC. The compactness, thickness, and adhesion strength of the SiC coating gradually increased with the increase of preparation temperature, while the coating delamination and cracking are occurred in the coating prepared at 2173K. Erosion test results showed that, compared with the C/C composites, the SiC coating could effectively improve the erosion resistance. The erosion rate of the SiC coated C/C composites obtained at 2073K was reduced by approximately 6.1-fold after erosion at normal angle for 50s. The eroded surface revealed that coating cracking and delamination, fiber/matrix debonding, fiber breakage, and material removal were the erosion mechanism of SiC coated C/C composites.","Shi, Wei;Tan, Yi;Hao, Jianjie;Li, Jiayan",2016-11-15,Ceramics International,"Carbon/carbon composites,Coatings,SiC,Erosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.08.083,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.08.083

The most stable suspensions of nHA and nHA-Ta2O5 nanoparticles were achieved with 16 mL/L TEA according to the sedimentation test and zeta potential measurement results. The enhanced colloidal stability of nanoparticles in n-butanol by TEA addition was investigated by FTIR analysis. The highest in-situ EPD kinetics were accomplished from suspensions containing an optimum concentration of dispersant. The phase compositions and microstructures of the coatings, before and after sintering under 1.4 × 10−6 mbar vacuum at 800 °C for 1 h, were perused using XRD and FESEM, respectively. The results of the nano-scratch analysis showed the highest critical distance of delamination (0.38 mm), normal load before failure (133 mN) as well as the critical contact pressure (7.12 GPa) for nHA-Ta2O5 coating on the NiTi. The concentration of the released Ni ions from passivated-NiTi with nHA coating in PBS after 30 days of immersion reduced from 45.72 to 5.62 μg/Lcm2 by introducing Ta2O5 in nHA matrix. On the other hand, the improved corrosion behavior of passivated-NiTi with nHA-Ta2O5 coating in comparison to that of with nHA deposit was explained with the lower amount of open porosities in the microstructure. The biocompatibility of the nHA and nHA-Ta2O5 surfaces were studied by osteoblast cell attachment during 7 days of culturing.","Horandghadim, Nazila;Khalil-Allafi, Jafar",2019-06-01,Ceramics International,"NiTi shape memory alloy,Hydroxyapatite-tantalum pentoxide coating,Electrophoretic deposition,Triethanolamine,Bonding behavior,Biocompatibility",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.105,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.105
"Wear mechanisms identification using Kelvin probe force microscopy in TiN, ZrN and TiN/ZrN hard ceramic multilayers coatings","Mechanical and tribological properties of titanium nitride, zirconium nitride, and (TiN/ZrN)n multilayers were studied to examine the potential of Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) to identify wear mechanisms. Crystalline structure, chemical composition, residual stress, and the mechanical properties showed that the coatings are iso-structural polycrystalline multilayers, with a reduction of grain size, crystallite size, and compressive stress; however, hardness increased with increase in the number of the bilayers. Pin-on-disc test was used for tribological evaluation, and wear tracks were analyzed using field-emission scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersed spectroscopy (FE-SEM/EDS) and KPFM. The increase in mechanical properties generated predominantly abrasive wear mechanisms. Abrasive and adhesive wear mechanisms differentiated by KPFM demonstrated that fragile wear mechanisms presented differences in capacitance and surface potential and that the method is sensitive when the adhered material presents differences in chemical composition. We have demonstrated KPFM to be a promising technique to study tribo-oxidation processes, providing experimental evidence to understand the wear mechanisms at nanometric scales.","González-Carmona, J.M.;Triviño, J.D.;Gómez-Ovalle, Á.;Ortega, C.;Alvarado-Orozco, J.M.;Sánchez-Sthepa, H.;Avila, A.",2020-10-15,Ceramics International,"Multilayers,Mechanical properties,KPFM,Abrasion and adhesion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.248,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.248
Hardness and friction behavior of bulk CoAl2O4 and Co–Al2O3 composite layers formed during Spark Plasma Sintering of CoAl2O4 powders,"Materials made up of a Co–Al2O3 composite coating over a CoAl2O4 core are prepared during Spark Plasma Sintering of CoAl2O4 powders. The Co particles are precipitated because of a combination of high temperature and low O2 partial pressure. The precipitation and densification processes hamper each other and thus the way the uniaxial pressure is applied during the sintering cycle is an important parameter to control the microstructure of composite layer and its thickness (about 100μm) and obtain a dense sample (about 4g/cm3). The friction coefficient of the Co-Al2O3 composites against an Al2O3 ball is lower than that found for an Al2O3 specimen, which could reveal the lubricating role of submicrometer Co particles. However, increasing the load from 5 to 10N load causes major changes in the friction contact, which are detrimental. Bulk CoAl2O4 was found to have a Vickers microhardness about 15.5GPa and an average friction coefficient lower than that of an Al2O3 sample.","Pavia, Anthony;Laurent, Christophe;Weibel, Alicia;Peigney, Alain;Chevallier, Geoffroy;Estournès, Claude",2012-08-31,Ceramics International,"B.

Direct fabrication of ZrC/ZrSi composite fibers from ZrSiO4/C precursors in molten chlorides by electrochemical method,"ZrC/ZrSi composite fibers were directly electro-synthesized from inexpensive and abundantly available ZrSiO4/C precursors in molten CaCl2–NaCl at 850 °C. Electrolysis was conducted at a constant voltage of 2.8 V using a graphite anode and a cathode composed of ZrSiO4/carbon mixture. The reaction mechanism of electro-synthesis process was systematically investigated by examination of partially and fully reduced samples. Results show that as-synthesized nanofiber is composed of ZrSi single crystal core and ZrC outer coating. The mechanism of composite fiber formation is a complex reaction pathway involving decomposition, electro-deoxidation and in situ carbonization. The electrochemical route in molten salt is a new promising method for simple fabrication of Zr-based composite fibers.","Liu, Hongxia;Song, Weihao;Xu, Qian;Ma, Wen;Bai, Yu",2020-04-15,Ceramics International,"ZrC,Composite fibers,ZrSi,Electrochemical,ZrSiO4,Molten salt",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.025
"Suspension high velocity oxy-fuel spraying of a rutile TiO2 feedstock: Microstructure, phase evolution and photocatalytic behaviour","Nano-structured TiO2 coatings were produced by suspension high velocity oxy fuel (SHVOF) thermal spraying using water-based suspensions containing 30wt% of submicron rutile powders (~180nm). By changing the flame heat powers from 40kW to 101kW, TiO2 coatings were obtained with distinctive microstructures, phases and photocatalytic behaviour. Spraying with low power (40kW) resulted in a more porous microstructure with the presence of un-melted nano-particles and a lower content of the anatase phase; meanwhile, high powers (72/101kW) resulted in denser coatings and rougher surfaces with distinctive humps but not necessarily with a higher content of anatase. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was used to evaluate the photocatalytic performance. Surprisingly, coatings with the lowest anatase content (~20%) using 40kW showed the best photocatalytic behaviour with the highest photo-conversion efficiency. It was suggested that this was partially owing to the increased specific surface area of the un-melted nano-particles. More importantly, the structural arrangement of the similarly sized TiO2 nano-crystallites between rutile and antase phases also created catalytic “hot spots” at the rutile−anatase interface and greatly improved the photo-activity.","Bai, M.;Khammas, R.;Guan, L.;Murray, J.W.;Hussain, T.",2017-12-01,Ceramics International,"SHVOF,Rutile,Anatase,Microstructure,Phase evolution,Photocatalytic",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.068,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.068
High thermal conductivity composites obtained by novel surface treatment of boron nitride,"Thermal conductivity of boron nitride is extremely anisotropic. To solve this problem, aggregate boron nitride (A-BN) was fabricated using binder. However, it is easily broken by external forces and has poor wettability. In this study, a new substance that overcomes these issues was introduced. Its coating material was prepared through a hydrolysis and condensation reaction involving polysilazane (PSZ) and (3-glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (GPTMS); The PSZ protected the shape of the A-BN and the GPTMS enhances its wettability. After solving these inherent problems of A-BN, the thermal conductivity was 7.014 W/m*K at a filler fraction of 50 vol%, which was 50 times higher than that of a neat epoxy composite.","Wie, Jaehyun;Kim, Kwanwoo;Kim, Jooheon",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"Surface treatment,High thermal conductivity,Surface analysis",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.063,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.063
Formation of thin layer graphite wrapped meso-porous SiOx and its lithium storage application,"Here a nonstoichiometric silicon oxide with mesoporous structure and graphitized carbon coating layer was synthesized through a two-step process. A partially magnesiothermic reduction of mesoporous SiO2 precursor, followed by the pyrolysis of the generated mesoporous SiOx hybrid with various metal phthalocyanines was applied. The obtained mesoporous SiOx@graphite-M (M = Fe, Co and Ni) materials demonstrated a reversible capacity of 757, 721 and 628 mAh g−1 under the current density of 0.2 A g−1, respectively, as the anode materials in LIBs. They also exhibited superior rate performance, which can still maintain specific capacities of 588, 480 and 417 mAh g−1 even at current density of 5 A g−1. When the mesoporous SiOx@graphite-Fe material is assembled with the LiFePO4 cathode to construct a full LIB, a capacity of 126 mAh g−1 with a retention rate over 99.2% after 100 cycles at a 1 C rate was presented. The good electrochemical performances of those SiOx based materials can be attributed to the transition metal induced graphitized carbon coating and the mesoporous structure, which not only offered the buffer media, but also provided enhanced electronic and ionic conductivity.","Liu, Dan;Fang, Kan;You, Xinhua;Tang, Haolin;Xie, Zhi-zhong;Li, Junsheng;Li, Xi;Qu, Deyu",2019-12-15,Ceramics International,"Nonstoichiometric silicon oxides,Metal induced graphitized carbon,Meso-porous structure,Thin layer graphite coating,Anode material for LIBs",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.210,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.210
An environmentally friendly approach to produce single-layer anti-reflective coatings on large surfaces using wet chemical method,"Sustainable production of anti-reflective coatings demands environmentally friendly approaches. This paper introduces a novel method of preparing thin films from an aqueous medium using a sol-gel technique. Single-layer anti-reflective coatings, from water-based silica sols, were prepared and characterized. The thicknesses of thin films were found to be between 75 and 135 nm with refractive indexes between 1.23 and 1.41 and porosities between 7 and 53%. The maximum transmissions of manufactured coatings reached from 99.85% to 99.03% in the visible region. The ageing of silica particles in the aqueous medium was studied using TEM. The transparent water-based sol consisted of individual silicon-dioxide nanoparticles with narrow size distribution (15–20 nm). The TEM images showed, that the silica nanoparticles become uniform and distinguishable within two weeks and no aggregation occurs within 46 days. It was found, that the aqueous silica sol is stable and clear for more than 6 months. The aqueous silica films deposited onto large glass surfaces were found to be homogeneous, with excellent adhesion (Cross Hatch Test is 0; ISO 2409 test standard) and hardness equal to 2H. We present a schematic illustration of the adsorption mechanism of non-ionic silicone surfactant and Pluronic surfactant on the silica surface.","Kócs, Lenke;Jilavi, Mohammad H.;Koch, Marcus;de Oliveira, Peter W.",2020-11-30,Ceramics International,"SiO2 nanoparticles,Sol–gel processes,Porosity,Optical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.069,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.069
Polymer derived SiC environmental barrier coatings with superwetting properties,"Surfaces with superwetting capabilities can be used for corrosion protection, self-cleaning and bio-fouling protection amongst other applications. In this work, we present a method to produce a SiC coating with an almost superhydrophobic behavior exhibiting water contact angles of 145±3°. Ceramic coatings were produced by the pyrolysis of polycarbosilane as a preceramic precursor of SiC. Aluminum and carbon powders were used as active and passive fillers to compensate for the volume shrinkage of polycarbosilane during pyrolysis. The effects of particle size (Al particles ranging from 0.8 to 10µm) and concentration 10–30% wt.) C and Al of both fillers were studied to produce defect-free ceramic coatings. We have observed that the fillers used not only affected the microstructure but also the surface roughness. We show that the addition of carbon fillers can increase the water contact angle of the ceramic from 42° up to 141°. The combination of carbon and aluminum fillers resulted in water contact angles up to 145°.","Hernández-Rodríguez, Pedro;López-Honorato, Eddie",2017-10-01,Ceramics International,"Polycarbosilane,Silicon carbide,Coating,Filler materials,Ceramic precursor,Hydrophobic surface",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.326,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.326
Effect of composition and annealing on the dielectric properties of ZnO/mullite composite coatings,"ZnO/mullite composite coatings were fabricated by atmosphere plasma spraying technology (APS). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed to investigate the microstructures and compositions of the feedstock and coatings. The permittivity–frequency properties were determined in the microwave frequency range of 8.2–12.4GHz by network analysis. Our results show that both the real and imaginary part of permittivity increase greatly with increasing ZnO content over the frequency range of 8.2–12.4GHz, which can be ascribed to interfacial polarization and orientation polarization. However, the composite coatings after 900°C annealing for 5h show much lower permittivity, due to the decrease of ZnO content resulting from the further reactions between the ZnO and mullite. Results indicate that the composite coating has excellent permittivity in room temperature, while for high temperature application, more investigation should be done.","Zhou, Liang;Zhou, Wancheng;Su, Jinbu;Luo, Fa;Zhu, Dongmei",2012-03-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Citric acid as anti-hydration additive for magnesia containing refractory castables,"Magnesia hydration is a key concern in refractory castable processing. The volumetric expansion that follows this reaction can result in cracks or even explosion during the first heating-up. Citric acid (CA) and other chelants can significantly reduce MgO hydration rate in aqueous suspensions by forming an insoluble magnesium citrate protective coating on the magnesia particles’ surface. In the present work, the performance of CA as an anti-hydration additive in refractory castables was evaluated by hydration tests, mechanical strength and apparent volumetric expansion (AVE) measurements and thermogravimetry. The results attained have shown that CA effectiveness depends strongly on the amount added and by the interaction with other raw materials in the composition, in particular calcium aluminate cement.","Salomão, R.;Pandolfelli, V.C.",2011-08-31,Ceramics International,"Refractory castables,Magnesia,Hydration,Chelants,Citric acid",10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.03.050,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.03.050
Detonation spraying behavior of TiCx–Ti powders and the role of reactive processes in the coating formation,"In this work, the formation of coatings by chemical reaction-accompanied detonation spraying of TiCx–Ti composite powders differing in the microstructure and carbon content was studied. The powders were synthesized by a reaction between titanium and carbon in the presence of excess of titanium via self-propagating high-temperature synthesis followed by mechanical milling with an additional amount of titanium (which produced a composite product containing 4.2wt% of carbon) or by thermal annealing of mechanically milled mixtures containing 2.1wt% of carbon. It was found that in the detonation coatings, the relative amount of metallic titanium dramatically decreased in comparison with the powders due to its reactions with carbon and nitrogen contained in the spraying atmosphere and the formation of titanium carbonitrides TiNvCw. It was possible to distinguish regions in the cross-section of the coatings with a composite microstructure inherited from the powders and with a microstructure in situ formed by the products of chemical reactions that occurred during spraying. The volumes of the material with the in situ formed microstructure contained the major fraction of the porosity of the coatings. The average hardness of the TiCx–TiNvCw–Ti coatings ranged between 400 and 480HV. Despite higher porosity of the coatings formed at higher degrees of chemical transformation, their average hardness increased. No significant differences in the hardness of the coatings produced from two feedstock powders were observed. The similarity between the coating formation processes from two TiCx–Ti powders of different microstructures and the similarity of those to the coating formation process from a metallic titanium powder show that the reactivity of titanium during detonation spraying is a crucial factor determining the coating microstructure and properties.","Dudina, Dina V.;Pribytkov, Gennady A.;Krinitcyn, Maksim G.;Korchagin, Michail A.;Bulina, Natalia V.;Bokhonov, Boris B.;Batraev, Igor S.;Rybin, Denis K.;Ulianitsky, Vladimir Yu.",2016-01-31,Ceramics International,"Porosity,Detonation spraying,Coatings,Titanium carbide,Titanium carbonitrides",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.08.166,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.08.166
CMAS (CaO–MgO–Al2O3–SiO2) resistance of Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 thermal barrier coatings with Pt layers,"Calcium–magnesium–alumina–silicate (CMAS) corrosion significantly affects the durability of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). In this study, Y2O3 partially stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) TBCs are produced by electron beam-physical vapor deposition, followed by deposition of a Pt layer on the coating surfaces to improve the CMAS resistance. After exposure to 1250°C for 2h, the YSZ TBCs were severely attacked by molten CMAS, whereas the Pt-covered coatings exhibited improved CMAS resistance. However, the Pt layers seemed to be easily destroyed by the molten CMAS. With increased heat duration, the Pt layers became thinner. After CMAS attack at 1250°C for 8h, only a small amount of Pt remained on the coating surfaces, leading to accelerated degradation of the coatings. To fully exploit the protectiveness of the Pt layers against CMAS attack, it is necessary to improve the thermal compatibility between the Pt layers and molten CMAS.","Liu, Hui;Cai, Jin;Zhu, Jihong",2018-01-31,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs),Electron beam-physical vapor deposition,Calcium–magnesium–alumina–silicate (CMAS),Pt layer",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.197,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.197
Bimodal microstructure ZrB2-MoSi2 coating prepared by atmospheric plasma spraying for carbon/carbon composites against long-term ablation,"To protect carbon/carbon composites against long-term ablation, a bimodal microstructure ZrB2-MoSi2 coating, consisting of an outer ZrB2-MoSi2 layer modified by Y2O3 and an inner basal ZrB2-MoSi2 layer, was prepared by atmospheric plasma spraying. The microstructure, phase composition and ablation resistance of the proposed coating were investigated in detail. Results showed that the bimodal coating maintained integrity in structure except for phase composition. There was no visible interlayer between the inner ZrB2-MiSi2 layer and the outer modified one. Mass ablation rate of the bimodal microstructure ZrB2-MoSi2 coated C/C composites was −2.02 × 10−3 g/s under an oxyacetylene flame ablation at 1873K for 600s, which exhibited better ablation resistance than a single ZrB2-MoSi2 coating. The excellent ablation resistance was ascribed to the positive effect of Y2O3, which not only pined in the glassy phase and alleviated the volatilization of SiO2 glass phase by reacting with SiO2 to form high viscosity of Y2SiO5, but also stabilized ZrO2 and promoted its recrystallization and growth.","Liu, Xuezhang;Han, Wei;Wen, Kui;Deng, Chunming;Deng, Changguang;Liu, Min;Zhou, Kesong",2017-12-15,Ceramics International,"C/C composite,Atmospheric plasma spraying,Coating,Ablation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.056,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.056

The coated substrates were thermally treated with a heating rate of 1 °C/min up to 300 °C and 5 °C/min up to 650 °C in order to obtain homogeneous and cracks free films.

Alumina composite coatings with enhanced high-temperature electrical insulating properties on Ni-based superalloy substrates,"Electrical insulation of nickel-based superalloy substrate, especially at high temperature range, is one of the major challenges for the reliability and stability of the integrated thin-film sensors. Here, we report a solution-processed approach to fabricating high-temperature, electrically insulating coatings on Ni-based superalloy substrates. NiCrAlY coatings were fabricated by DC magnetron sputtering and heat-treated, and then Al2O3 films were deposited by sol-gel method. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the composition, phase, microstructure and morphology of these composite coatings. The electrical resistance of the composite coating was measured as a function of temperature up to 800°C. Electrical resistance greater than 1MΩ were consistently achieved from 600°C to 800°C. Moreover, this insulating coating survived thermal shock and thermal fatigue tests without cracking or delaminating.

Effect of powder composition on the failure and melting behaviour of yttria stabilized zirconia ingot with a bimodal structure,"Yttria (Y2O3) stabilized zirconia (ZrO2) containing 8wt% yttria, 8YSZ, was fabricated with an ingot shape with different powder compositions. Ingot shape 8YSZ is commercially used as a source to fabricate thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) by an electron beam (EB) evaporation process. Powder mixtures with different mixing ratios using small (mean dia. of ~40nm) and large (40–80µm, granulated) raw material powders were used to form the ingots in the present study. In addition, the tetragonal and monoclinic phases of raw powders were used selectively. The ingots from various powder mixtures showed a bimodal structure of small and large grains with 55–60% relative density (3.0–3.5g/cm3). The ingots formed from the mixtures using nanometer size powder with a large content of the monoclinic phase and several tens of micrometer size powder with the tetragonal phase showed better thermal shock resistance compared to the ingot from a simple mixture with a bimodal particle distribution. Furthermore, for these ingots, it appears that an additional cold isostatic pressing (CIP) process between uni-axial pressing and heat treatment processes might provide mechanical enhancement to form a more stable melt spot during the EB irradiation process compared to other ingot samples.","Oh, Yoon-Suk;Chae, Jung-Min;Choi, Sun-Ah;Han, Yoon-Soo;Kim, Seong-Won;Lee, Sung-Min;Kim, Hyung-Tae;Ahn, Jong-Kee;Kim, Tae-Hyung;Kim, Dong-Hoon",2017-01-31,Ceramics International,"YSZ,Thermal shock,Thermal barrier coating,Electron beam,Strength",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.090,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.090

The SG-LMS electrode exhibited higher specific capacity and superior cycle retention as compared to the LMS electrode prepared by a conventional solid-state reaction. Such high electrochemical performance originated from the presence of a high-purity phase, a large surface area, and an efficient electron transport path facilitated by the conductive carbon coating of the SG-LMS electrode.","Park, Kyung-Soo;Jin, Yun-Ho;Kang, Lee-Seung;Lee, Gwang-Hee;Lee, Nam-Hee;Kim, Dong-Wan;Hong, Hyun Seon",2014-08-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Antibacterial and magnetic response of site-specific cobalt incorporated hydroxyapatite,"Hydroxyapatite [HA, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2] based ceramics are a potential candidate for orthopedic implants, bone cements, and bioactive coating over metallic implants due to their compositional similarities [Ca/P = 1.67] with human bone. Cobalt doping in HA can greatly enhance angiogenesis and vascularization along with incorporating antimicrobial properties to HA. For the first time, this work reports the importance of Co doping sites on biological and magnetic properties of HA. In the current work, Co doing in HA has been carried out according to the chemical formula Ca10(PO4)6Cox(OH)2-α and Ca10-x Cox(PO4)6(OH)2, (x = 0, 0.2 and 0.3) to assess the correlation of individual Co incorporation sites on crystal chemistry, cytotoxicity, magnetic properties, ion leaching and antibacterial efficacy. Dependence of antibacterial efficacy on different doping sites revealed that cytocompatible Co doped HA is antibacterial against E. coli, and S. aureus mainly after substitution of Co in Ca site. Additionally, a minor antibacterial effect has been noticed after Co doping in OH channels. Interestingly, the Ca substituted Co doped HA shows Co leaching up to ∼758 ppb (obtained from inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry), which comes to only ∼27 ppb after incorporating Co in OH channel. This higher Co leaching (when doped at Ca site in comparison to that at OH channels) is the major cause of better antibacterial efficacy. Vibrating sample magnetometer measurements showed that the order of mr and ms values significantly changes after altering the doping sites, due to change in local Co environment. Thus, this work proves that different doping sites of Co doped HA can greatly enhance its antibacterial properties with significant changes in crystallographic and magnetic properties, which make Co doped HA an ideal choice as a bone replacement material or drug delivery agent with tailored properties depending on the doping sites.","Bhattacharjee, Arjak;Gupta, Anshul;Verma, Madhu;Anand, Murugan Prem;Sengupta, Pradyut;Saravanan, Matheshwaran;Manna, Indranil;Balani, Kantesh",2020-01-31,Ceramics International,"Hydroxyapatite,Doping site,In vitro,Magnetic properties,Antibacterial properties,Cytotoxicity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.291,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.291

Surface morphologies, adhesion resistances and corrosion behaviors of the coatings were examined and the characterization of the coatings was performed by using XRD, SEM, and EDS. It was observed that porous and crack-free surface morphology enhanced adhesion strength of the coatings. Through the shear tests, it was found that the adhesion resistance was 25.14MPa in HA coatings and 25.47MPa in HA–SiO2 coatings. Corrosion analyses of the coatings were performed by using potentiodynamic polarization (PDS) tests. It was determined that corrosion dimples formed on the coating surface and the corrosion resistance in HA+SiO2 coatings increased with decreasing porosity; however, in the further steps of corrosion, it reached to the base material by causing a pitting effect on the coated surface.","Say, Yakup;Aksakal, Bunyamin;Dikici, Burak",2016-06-30,Ceramics International,"REX-734,Hydroxyapatite,Silica,Sol–gel,Adhesion,Corrosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.03.127,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.03.127
Facile synthesis of thermoelectric films via spin-coating metastable precursors,"In this paper, we reported on a novel, simple, and cost-effective chemical route to fabrication of thermoelectric films, such as Bi, PbTe, and Bi2Te3. The films were prepared by spinning coating corresponding metastable precursor solutions, using TeO2 and/or metallic salt as the starting materials, and KBH4 as reductant.

Microstructure and wear behaviour of powder and suspension hybrid Al2O3–YSZ coatings,"Suspension based plasma sprayed coatings can yield superior microstructural and tribological properties compared to conventional powder based plasma sprayed coatings. This study investigates a new hybrid method, using simultaneous spraying from powder and suspension, to produce composite coatings using alumina and yttria stabilised zirconia (YSZ), with potentially excellent wear and thermal properties. Dry sliding wear showed the alumina suspension-YSZ suspension coating yielded half the specific wear rate of the alumina powder-YSZ suspension, explained by preferential gamma alumina formation and increased porosity in the latter. Both YSZ-containing samples showed superior toughness and wear rate than simple alumina powder and suspension coatings.","Murray, James W.;Leva, Alessandro;Joshi, Shrikant;Hussain, Tanvir",2018-05-31,Ceramics International,"A suspensions,B composites,C wear resistance,D Al2O3",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.048,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.048
Low-temperature oxidation resistance of the silica-coated MoSi2 powders prepared by sol-gel preoxidation method,"MoSi2 has been regarded as one of the most promising structural materials, due to its excellent high-temperature oxidation resistance and high emissivity. However, as the most commonly used emittance agent in high emissivity coatings, it can be easily oxidized when the operating temperature is below 600 °C. To address this issue, the silica-coated MoSi2 powders with good low-temperature (400–600 °C) oxidation resistance were fabricated by a sol-gel method followed by a preoxidation process. Here in, by the combination of the non-isothermal and cyclic-isothermal oxidation analysis, we demonstrate that the silica gel film coated on MoSi2 can prevent oxidation to some extent, but the preoxidation treatment plays a more critical role in improving its oxidation resistance at low temperature. Both the sol-gel and preoxidation processes enable the integrated and compact encapsulation of the silica coating. The synthesized silica-coated MoSi2 exhibits excellent oxidation resistance with slightly weight gains (<1 wt%) after cyclic-isothermal oxidation at 400–600 °C for 12 h.","Guo, Linlin;Hu, Xiaoxia;Tao, Xin;Du, Haiyan;Guo, Anran;Liu, Jiachen",2020-10-15,Ceramics International,"Sol-gel processes (A),Preoxidation,Silica coating,MoSi2,Oxidation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.117,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.117
ZnO nanostructures decorated hollow glass microspheres as near infrared reflective pigment,"Hollow glass microsphere/ZnO composite pigments were successfully prepared by a facile sol-gel method. ZnO coating layers composed of nanosheets, nanoplates, or nanoparticles were anchored at the surface of hollow glass microspheres by formation of Zn-O-Si bond. A reasonable growth mechanism for elucidating the formation of ZnO nanocoating was proposed. The results indicated that the near-infrared reflectance property of the composite pigments was strongly affected by the morphology of ZnO nanostructures. The nanoparticles structures exhibited higher near-infrared reflectance than that of nanosheets and nanoplates structures. The near-infrared solar reflectance of hollow glass microsphere/ZnO composite pigments was 95.7%, while the total solar reflectance of the composite pigment was as high as 97.2%. An approximately 11.1°C decrease in outer surface temperature was obtained for the heat box coated with composite pigments. Therefore, hollow glass microsphere/ZnO composites are excellent near infrared reflective pigments for efficient solar reflective coatings designed for building facades and roofs.","Lu, Denghui;Gao, Qiang;Wu, Xiaomei;Fan, Yueming",2017-08-15,Ceramics International,"Hollow glass microsphere,ZnO,Thermal insulation,Near-infrared reflectance,Coating,Composite pigment",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.067,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.067
Fabrication of transparent superhydrophobic porous silica coating for self-cleaning and anti-fogging,"Transparent coatings with self-cleaning and anti-fogging properties have received significant attention for their potential applications. In this paper, highly transparent porous silica coatings were fabricated on glass substrate through layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly of raspberry-like polystyrene@silica (PS@SiO2) microparticles followed by calcination at high temperature. The as prepared coatings showed superhydrophilic property while displayed superhydrophobicity after chemical vapor deposition with low surface energy material. After two assembly cycles, the superhydrophobic porous silica coating had a water contact angle as high as 159°±2° with a sliding angle of 7°±1.5° and a transmittance of 85%. It is demonstrated that the number of assembly cycles affected the transmittance and wettability of porous silica coatings. In addition, the anti-fogging properties of the transparent superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic surfaces were investigated, presenting totally different fogging behavior.","Shang, Qianqian;Zhou, Yonghong",2016-05-15,Ceramics International,"Transparent,Hollow silica microspheres,Superhydrophobic,Self-cleaning,Anti-fogging",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.02.105,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.02.105
Thermophysical properties of La2(Zr0.7Ce0.3)2O7 prepared by hydrothermal synthesis for nano-sized thermal barrier coatings,"Nano-sized lanthanum–zirconium–cerium composite oxide (La2(Zr0.7Ce0.3)2O7, LZ7C3) for potential TBCs (thermal barrier coatings) application was synthesized via a hydrothermal method. The crystal structures, morphologies, and sintering behaviors of the as-prepared powders and sintered ceramic bodies were investigated by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and high resolution transmission electron microscopy. The XRD and Raman spectroscopy results indicate that LZ7C3 shows a pyrochlore-type structure throughout the sintering temperature from 1000°C to 1500°C. The relative density, volume shrinkage rate, thermal expansion coefficient, and thermal conductivity of LZ7C3 are also investigated and compared with La2Zr2O7 and 8YSZ. The results reveal that nano-sized LZ7C3 is potentially suitable for the application as a TBCs material.","Wang, Chunjie;Wang, Yue",2015-04-30,Ceramics International,"Ceramics,LZ7C3,Nano-sized,Thermophysical property",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.12.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.12.003
Influence of Si addition on structure and properties of TiB2-Si nanocomposite coatings deposited by high-power impulse magnetron sputtering,"TiB2 coatings with various Si doping levels were fabricated using magnetron sputtering from TiB2 and Si targets. The chemical and phase composition, microstructure, mechanical properties, and high-temperature oxidation resistance of the coatings were investigated using different techniques, such as electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoindentation, and thermogravimetric analysis. The results revealed that the microstructure of the TiB2 coating with and without Si doping changed from an apparent columnar structure to a densely stacked structure, and finally to a nearly featureless planar structure. A certain amount of added Si limits the growth of TiB2 grains and favors the formation of a nanocomposite structure with nanocrystalline TiB2 grains embedded in an amorphous Si phase matrix, as shown by XPS and TEM results. The hardness reached a maximum value of 35.2 GPa at 4.5 at% Si and then linearly decreased upon further increasing the Si content, owing to the excessively amorphous phase in coatings. However, it is worth noting that the high-temperature oxidation resistance of the coatings was improved by Si addition, due to their compact homogeneous structure that hinders the diffusion of oxygen. The results indicate that the hardness and oxidation resistance of the coatings can be simultaneously improved by the addition of an appropriate Si content.","Ding, Ji Cheng;Lee, Damin;Mei, Haijuan;Zhang, Teng Fei;Kang, Myung Chang;Wang, Qi Min;Kim, Kwang Ho",2019-04-01,Ceramics International,"TiB2 coating,HiPIMS,Si content,Microstructure,Hardness,Oxidation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.122,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.122
Phase and microstructure evolution in precursor plasma-sprayed YIG coatings,"Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) coatings were prepared using a liquid precursor plasma spray (PPS) method. Regular and reverse co-precipitated feedstock sols were directly sprayed through a radio frequency (RF) plasma torch. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses revealed the formation of amorphous coating in the as-sprayed condition. Post-annealing treatments resulted into nanostructured garnet coatings and the crystallinity of the coatings increased as a function of increasing annealing temperature. Coating annealed at 1000°C/h exhibited a saturation magnetization of 65emu/cc and a coercivity of 37Oe. PPS approach feeds on molecularly mixed precursor liquids or sols, obviating the need for pre-mixed powders and thus opening up new avenues for developing nanostructured magnetic oxide coatings.","Guo, X.Z;Ravi, B.G.;Yan, Q.Y.;Gambino, R.J.;Sampath, S.;Margolies, J.;Parise, J.B.",2006-12-31,Ceramics International,"A.

SiO2 coated platy TiO2 designed for noble UV/IR-shielding materials,"SiO2 coated platy TiO2 (S-pTi) was prepared as a noble UV/IR(Ultraviolet/Infrared)-shielding material by a modified Stöber method. S-pTi consists of a dense and uniform SiO2 shell onto platy TiO2 (pTi) core, and the thickness of SiO2 shell layer was coated about 8–20 nm by tuning SiO2 coating amount. The zeta-potential of S-pTi was decreased from −12 to −32 mV with increasing amounts of coated SiO2, indicating the improvement of dispersibility between the particles. The UV-shielding ability of S-pTi was improved by enhancing UV absorption of the SiO2 coating layer onto pTi and thus the photocatalytic activity was suppressed effectively. Compared to nanosized TiO2(nTi), S-pTi showed higher UV absorption at the shorter wavelength and exhibited higher IR reflectance because of high reflective index and the crystal shape and size of pTi to reflect the IR effectively under its wide shielding area. These results can contribute to the prevention of harmful UV and the maintenance of a cool environment from IR heat source as noble UV/IR-shielding materials on the skin.","Kim, Hee Jung;Roh, Dong Kyu;Chang, Jeong Ho;Kim, Dae-Sung",2019-10-01,Ceramics International,"SiO2 coated platy TiO2,Core-shell coating,UV absorption,IR reflectance,Sunscreen material",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.231,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.231
Hydrothermally-grown nanostructured anatase TiO2 coatings tailored for photocatalytic and antibacterial properties,"Low-temperature solution growth of TiO2 films provides unique surface functionalities for base materials that may not survive high processing temperatures. It involves multiple stages of crystal growth at various length scales. Having a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms involved in those stages is essential to obtain desirable functional performances. In this study, we prepared diverse anatase microstructures via a hydrothermal method, all of which start from homogeneous nucleation of the nanoparticles when precursor solution reaches above a critical saturation point. Depending on pH, concentration, temperature and ionic species of precursor solution, however, these primary nanoparticles evolve into different shapes of secondary nanostructures via aggregation of nanoparticles. Thin films of anatase TiO2 consisting of those secondary nanostructures, which have a [001]-texture with (004) surfaces exposed, exhibited the strongest photocatalytic as well as antibacterial properties.","Tao, Tao;Bae, In-Tae;Woodruff, Kaitlin B.;Sauer, Karin;Cho, Junghyun",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Anatase,TiO2,Texture,Hydrothermal,Photocatalytic,Antibacterial",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.017
"Synthesis, characterization and performance evaluation of an optimized ceramic membrane with physical separation and photocatalytic degradation capabilities","The main goal of the present study is synthesis, characterization and performance evaluation of an optimized photocatalytic ceramic membrane for wastewater treatment. It consists of three layers including alumina (Al2O3) macroporous support, colloidal titania (TiO2) mesoporous intermediate layer and polymeric TiO2 mesoporous top layer in order to obtain a pore gradient from the support through the top layer of membrane. The colloidal and polymeric TiO2 layers were prepared via the sol-gel method and coated using sol dip-coating approach. In order to optimize the membrane, physical separation and photocatalytic degradation capabilities of each colloidal and polymeric layer as a function of time were evaluated using Rhodamine B (RhB) aqueous solution. Thus, optimum coating number of intermediate layer and top layer were determined. Also, the performance of the optimized membrane was investigated via oily wastewater treatment using crude oil and water emulsion. Based on the performance results, two consequence colloidal layers and one polymeric layer were considered as the optimum layer number. Also, RhB photocatalytic degradation was 24.7% and RhB physical separation and permeation flux were 40.4% and 25.7 kg m−2 h−1, respectively. Furthermore, based on the oily wastewater treatment experiments, permeation flux and chemical oxygen demand (COD) rejection at the best-operating conditions (pressure of 5 bar, the temperature of 30 °C and cross flow of 600 l h−1) were 29.1 kg m−2 h−1 and 78.4%, respectively. The prepared membrane was found efficient and exhibited high industrial potential due to its multifunctional capability and thus can be employed as an advanced material for wastewater treatment applications.","Mahdavi, Hamid Reza;Arzani, Mehran;Mohammadi, Toraj",2018-06-15,Ceramics International,"Photocatalytic ceramic membrane,Titania,Physical separation,Photocatalytic degradation,Wastewater treatment",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.035,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.035
Enhanced dielectric and energy-storage properties in BiFeO3-modified Bi0.5(Na0.8K0.2)0.5TiO3 thin films,"Lead free Bi0.5(Na0.8K0.2)0.5TiO3 thin films doped with BiFeO3 (abbreviated as BNKT-xBFO) (x = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.10) were deposited on Pt(111)/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates by sol-gel/spin coating technique and the effects of BiFeO3 content on the crystal structure and electrical properties were investigated in detail. The results showed that all the BNKT-xBFO thin films exhibited a single perovskite phase structure and high-dense surface. Reduced leakage current density, enhanced dielectric and ferroelectric properties were achieved at the optimal composition of BNKT-0.10BFO thin films, with a leakage current density, dielectric constant, dielectric loss and maximum polarization of < 2 × 10−4 A/cm3, ~ 978, ~ 0.028 and ~ 74.13μC/cm2 at room temperature, respectively. Moreover, the BNKT-0.10BFO thin films possessed superior energy storage properties due to their slim P-E loops and large maximum polarization, with an energy storage density of 22.12J/cm3 and an energy conversion efficiency of 60.85% under a relatively low electric field of 1200kV/cm. Furthermore, the first half period of the BNKT-0.10BFO thin film capacitor was about 0.15μs, during which most charges and energy were released. The large recoverable energy density and the fast discharge process indicated the potential application of the BNKT-0.10BFO thin films in electrostatic capacitors and embedded devices.","Chen, Pan;Li, Peng;Zhai, Jiwei;Shen, Bo;Li, Feng;Wu, Shuanghao",2017-11-30,Ceramics International,"BNKT-BFO thin films,Sol-gel,Dielectric properties,Energy-storage properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.039,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.039
"Biomineralization, strength and cytocompatibility improvement of bredigite scaffolds through doping/coating","Coprecipitation-derived, sacrificial polymeric (urethane) foam-fabricated bredigite (Ca7MgSi4O16) scaffolds were processed by individual and combined treatments of fluoride doping and poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) coating and then studied in terms of structure, mechanical strength, bioactivity and cell biocompatibility in vitro. According to scanning electron microscopy and Archimedes porosimetry, the geometrical characteristics of pores for all the scaffolds are in the appropriate range for hard tissue regeneration applications. The apatite-formation ability of the samples immersed in a simulated body fluid is improved by doping for both the bare and coated conditions, based on microscopic and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic analyses. Both the treatments advantageously buffer physiological pH changes imposed due to the fast bioresorption of the ceramic. Also, the biodegradable PLGA coating typically enhances the compressive strength of the scaffolds, which is critical for bone tissue engineering. In accordance with the MTT assay on osteoblast-like cells (MG-63) cultures, both the processes individually enhance the cell viability, while the highest improvement is obtained for the combined application of them. It is finally concluded that fluoride doping and PLGA coating are impressive approaches to improve the bioperformance of bredigite-based scaffolds.","Keihan, R.;Ghorbani, A.R.;Salahinejad, E.;Sharifi, E.;Tayebi, L.",2020-09-30,Ceramics International,"Silicate (D),Sintering (A),Mechanical properties (C),Biomedical applications (E)",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.178,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.178
Rutile supported anatase nanostructured films as photocatalysts for the degradation of water contaminants,"For the first time, sintered TiO2 (rutile) substrate is utilized as a support for anatase TiO2 films. Ti4+ precursor resin was deposited by spin coating onto rutile substrates and the films were calcined at different temperatures (350–500°C) to form anatase. Anatase (101) formation was dependent on calcination temperature. The growth and properties of the films are also related to the substrate. The films presented bandgaps in the range of 2.86–2.79eV and photocatalytic activity for the degradation of Rhodamine B under UV light followed a pseudo-first order kinetics. The films maintained their photocatalytic properties after four consecutive test cycles where the films calcined at 450 and 500°C showed superior photocatalytic activity which is attributed to adequate crystallinity of anatase. The coexistence of anatase and rutile using our experimental approach is simple, and the photocatalytic activity of the films is robust and approximately unaltered after four degradation cycles.","Dawson, Margaret;Ribeiro, Caue;Morelli, Marcio Raymundo",2016-01-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Preparation and characterization of sol–gel Al2O3/Ni–P composite coatings on carbon steel,Ceramic films have been applied to improve the resistance against high temperature oxidation of carbon steels. Alumina film was prepared on carbon steel surface by a dip coating technique. Electroless Ni–P plating film has been pre-deposited as an intermediate layer to improve the adherence of the film to carbon steel substrate. The oxidation kinetics of coated sample was investigated by measuring weight gain at 800°C for 100h. The surface and cross-section morphology of samples before and after oxidation were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The composition and element distribution at the interface of the coated samples were analyzed by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and EMAX. The results show that the composite coating is uniform. The alumina coating adhesion strength to the substrate is up to 20±2N in scratch test because the alumina film presents interdiffusion of nickel and aluminum during heat treatment.

Fracture behaviour of ceramic–metallic glass gradient transition coating,"A new composite coating material of ceramic (Al2O3-40 wt% TiO2)–metallic glass (Fe56Cr23Mo13B8) gradient transition coating was successfully prepared by atmospheric plasma spraying technology, and a new theory of laminar–columnar structure gradient transition synergistic enhancement effect was proposed. The microstructure and element distribution of the composite coating were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). The fracture toughness and fracture behaviour of the composite coating were analysed via micro-hardness and three-point bending (3PB) tests. The results showed that the stress release of the ceramic–metallic glass gradient transition coating was stable compared with that of the conventional gradient coating in the stage of acute deformation, and the coating exhibited better fracture toughness. Different areas of the ceramic–metallic glass gradient transition coating exhibited different fracture behaviours. Additionally, the ceramic layer was made of columnar crystals, and the metal–glass layer was lamellar. The laminar–columnar structure gradient transition synergistic enhancement effect improved the anti-crack growth and fracture toughness.

Achieving thermally stable and anti-hydrolytic Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+ phosphor via a nanoscale carbon deposition strategy,"Chemical stability of phosphors is critical to the efficiency and lifetime of the white light-emitting diodes. Therefore, many strategies have been adopted to improve the stability of phosphors. However, it is still lack of report on the improvement of thermal stability and hydrolysis resistance of phosphors by a single layer coating. Due to the high transmittance and high chemical inertness of graphene, it was coated on the surface of Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+ phosphor by chemical vapor deposition, aiming to improve its thermal stability and hydrolysis resistance. The chemical composition and microstructure of the coating were characterized and analyzed. A nanoscale carbon layer was attached on the surface of Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+ phosphor particles in an amorphous state. In coated Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+ phosphor, the oxidation degree of Eu2+ to Eu3+ was significantly suppressed. At the same time, the surface of Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+ particle turned from hydrophilic to hydrophobic after carbon coating, and consequently the hydrolysis resistance of Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+ phosphor was greatly improved. After tests at 85 °C and 85% humidity for 200 h, the carbon coated Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+ phosphor still maintained about 95% of its initial luminous intensity as compared with 35% of the uncoated. By observing the in-situ microstructure evolution of coated phosphor in air-water vapor environment, remained presence of the carbon layer even at 500 °C explained the excellent chemical stability of carbon coated Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+ phosphor in complex environment. These results indicate that a nanoscale carbon layer can be used to provide superior thermal stability and hydrolysis resistance of (oxy) nitrides phosphors.","Liu, Yunxia;Wang, Hui;Chen, Daiyan;Gao, Lin;Wang, Xin;Jian, Xian;Mu, Chunhong;Xu, Xin;Zhao, Yujie;Yin, Liangjun",2020-09-24,Ceramics International,"Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+,Chemical vapor deposition,Carbon layer,Thermal stability,Hydrolysis resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.163,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.163

A carbon and Li7La3Zr2O12 hybrid coating imparted favorable properties to the Li3V2(PO4)3 electrode, enhancing the transport of both electrons and Li-ions at the electrode's surface. The as-prepared composite exhibited an excellent rate capability and a good cycling stability in the potential range from 3.0V to 4.8V (vs. Li+/Li). It displayed high discharge capacities of 177.3mAhg−1 and 171.5mAhg−1 at 1C and 2C, respectively. Even at a higher rate of 5C, it delivered a discharge capacity of 162.1mAhg−1, with capacity retention of 98.6% after 20 cycles.

Microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis of Eu2O3-coated spherical Y2O3 ceramic particles,"This paper reports on the synthesis of uncoated and Eu2O3-coated spherical Y2O3 ceramic particles using optimized hydrothermal (HM) and microwave-assisted hydrothermal (MWHM) routes. The integration of microwave and hydrothermal processes was shown to enhance the reaction kinetics during the synthesis of uncoated Y2O3. Spherical particles of pure Y2O3 phase with an average particle size of 600nm and uniform size distribution were obtained via the MWHM process at 180°C following reaction duration of only 1h. Y2O3 spherical particles were coated with Eu2O3 via a hydrolysis method at room temperature. The band gap of the resulting phosphors was estimated at 5.7eV. Eu2O3-coated Y2O3 particles synthesized via the HM and MWHM present bright red PL emission under UV excitations; however, Y2O3 particles obtained via the MWHM method are more efficient than those yielded via the HM technique. Eu2O3-coated Y2O3 particles derived using the optimized MWHM technique present efficient emissions of red light with color purity and down conversion efficiency of approximately 85% and 80%, respectively.

"Mechanical alloying, sintering and characterization of Al2O3–20wt%–Cu nanocomposite","Alumina-based matrix nanocomposite powder reinforced with 20wt%-Cu particles was fabricated by mechanical alloying. The starting powders mixture was milled in a planetary ball mill up to 20h. The effect of milling time on the properties of obtained powders was studied. X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to investigate phase composition, crystallite size and morphology of the milled powders. To study the sinterability, the milled nanocomposite powders were cold pressed at 10MPa and sintered in argon atmosphere at different firing temperatures, i.e. 1100, 1250, 1400, 1500 and 1550°C, for 1h. Physical properties, namely, bulk density and apparent porosity of sintered bodies were determined by the Archimedes method. Phase identification and microstructure of the sintered composites were investigated by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as well as energy dispersive spectrometry (EDAX). Microhardness and fracture toughness of sintered composite were also examined using Vickers indentor. The results revealed that a uniform distribution of Cu reinforcement in Al2O3 matrix, coating the particles, was successfully obtained after milling the powders. Also, there was no sign of phase changes during the milling. The crystallite size decreased at prolonged milling time while the internal strain increased. The maximum relative density was obtained after sintering at 1550°C. The hardness of the sintered composite improved while the fracture toughness slightly decreased with the prolongation of milling time.","Zawrah, Mahmoud F.;Essawy, Raghieba A.;Zayed, Hamdia A.;Abdel Fattah, Amira H.;Taha, Mohammed A.",2014-01-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Combustion synthesis of Si2N2O powder for photovoltaic silicon casting application,"Single-phase silicon oxynitride (Si2N2O) was prepared in a N2 atmosphere by combustion synthesis with Si and SiO2 as the reactants. The effects of process parameters, including N2 pressure, Si2N2O diluent and NH4Cl content, on the combustion temperature, as well as phase composition and microstructure of products were investigated. The high-temperature wetting behavior of Si melt on the as-prepared Si2N2O coating was then tested by the sessile drop method. It was found that Si melt shows poor wettability to Si2N2O coating at 1500 °C with the steady contact angle of 120°, indicating that the combustion-synthesized Si2N2O powders could be used as a potential novel releasing agent material for photovoltaic silicon casting application.","Deng, Shuxiang;He, Gang;Wang, Liang;Meng, Qing;Yang, Zengchao;Li, Jiangtao;Jiang, Lei",2020-10-24,Ceramics International,"Combustion synthesis,Single-phase Si2N2O,Wetting,Photovoltaic silicon",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.166,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.166
Painting method for hydroxyapatite coating on titanium substrate,"Coating on prostheses and implantable devices is one of the ways to increase the osseointegration of these products. However, plasma spray techniques, that are normally used, present high complexity and high cost. In this work, a new methodology for coating with nanometric hydroxyapatite is presented, with a low cost and ease of production. The technique proposed involves the formation of a suspension of hydroxyapatite (HAp) and oil of turpentine (OT) and its application, with a paintbrush, on the titanium substrate. In order to qualify the process for medical devices, the properties of the titanium substrate, before and after the coating process, the calcium phosphate phases present and the adhesive bond of the coating were evaluated. The results indicated that thermal treatment does not affect the properties of ASTM F67 titanium in order to compromise the properties and the analyses, by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, proved that no formation of second phases of calcium phosphate occurred. The adhesive bond assay showed that the coating behaved according to ISO 13779–2, i.e., it had adhesive bond values higher than 15 MPa. The proposed new coating method proved promising for the titanium coating and is an alternative to the complex and high cost processes normally used in metal implants.","Rodrigues Jr., L.F.;Tronco, M.C.;Escobar, C.F.;Rocha, A.S.;Santos, L.A.L.",2019-08-15,Ceramics International,"Hydroxyapatite,Coating,Titanium,Painting,Oil of turpentine",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.211,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.211
Single-step prepared hybrid ZnO/CuO nanopowders for water repellent and corrosion resistant coatings,"In this study, ZnO/CuO hybrid hydrophobic nanopowders were synthesized using a common single-step chemical precipitation route without using modifiers. Influence of initial ZnO:CuO precursor concentrations and alkaline agent type on the wettability behavior of the prepared samples were investigated. Wettability properties of the prepared samples were assessed by measuring the water contact angle and contact angle hysteresis values. Fourier transform infrared spectra, scanning electron microscope micrographs and X-ray diffraction patterns were applied to identify the surface chemistry and morphological features. Scanning electron microscope images of the synthesized ZnO/CuO nanocomposites indicated flower-like morphologies containing plenty of nano-needles, -rods, and -sheets with thicknesses lower than 90 nm. The sample prepared under the optimum conditions was superhydrophobic having water contact angle and contact angle hysteresis of 162.6°±1 and 2°, respectively. It was applied to coat the surface of stainless steel meshes by spray deposition method. The resultant superhydrophobic surface exhibited excellent self-cleaning (water repellency) property and a suitable stabilities under the ambient and saline solution (NaCl, 3.5%) media. Additionally, electrochemical corrosion tests confirmed that the corrosion resistance of the fabricated ZnO–CuO coating was higher than the initial bare mesh.","Velayi, Elmira;Norouzbeigi, Reza",2019-10-01,Ceramics International,"Hybrid nanopowders,Superhydrophobicity,Spray deposition,Corrosion resistant",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.229,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.229
Heat-treated lanthanum magnesium hexaaluminate coatings exposed to molten calcium-magnesium-alumino-silicate,"LaMgAl11O19 (LMA) coatings usually have a large amount of amorphous phase due to the rapid cooling during spraying, which will not benefit the service lifetime in aeroengine. Fortunately, the thermal cycling lifetime of LMA TBCs can be improved by heat treatment. Moreover, the hot corrosion degradation with calcium-magnesium-alumino-silicate (CMAS) attracts much attention recently. Therefore, to clarify the influence of heat treatment on CMAS corrosion behaviour, plasma-sprayed LMA coatings were isothermally heat-treated and then exposed to CMAS. Results indicate that heat treatment promoted a crystallization of LMA coatings, but the molten CMAS had completely penetrated into LMA coatings along the increased and widened vertical microcracks. It is the isotropic pores that determine the penetration kinetics of CMAS to LMA. CaAl2Si2O8 and MgAl2O4 were the predominant reaction products in the superficial layer, while Ca3La6(SiO4)6 interpenetrated with the residual LMA in the inner layer, forming a corroded bilayer for LMA coatings.","Zeng, Jinyan;Sun, Junbin;Liang, Panpan;Yang, Xiong;Dong, Shujuan;Jiang, Jianing;Deng, Longhui;Zhou, Xin;Cao, Xueqiang",2019-06-15,Ceramics International,"LaMgAl11O19 coatings,Isothermal heat-treatment,Porosity,Amorphous phase,CMAS corrosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.048,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.048
"Printing nano TiO2 on large-sized building materials: Technologies, surface modifications and functional behaviour","The industrial feasibility of large-sized, photocatalytic building materials was assessed by the adoption of suitable, fast and environmental friendly technological solutions. Nanostructured TiO2 coatings can be realized by ink-jet or roller printing of nano-anatase suspensions by modifying, in one single step, the chemistry and microstructural features of products. Functional coatings must be consolidated through additional thermal steps, which necessarily entail modifications of the current production cycles of ceramic tiles. This is due to the fact that the direct functionalization of unfired ceramics is detrimental to the photocatalytic performance. The microstructure of coatings depends on deposition technologies and processing conditions. However, photoactive materials that also display superhydrophilic behaviour can be obtained by employing much lower amounts of TiO2 than 1.0gm−2, and by annealing at temperature as low as 400–500°C. A limited increase of the cost of products is involved, especially in the case of large-sized elements.","Raimondo, M.;Guarini, G.;Zanelli, C.;Marani, F.;Fossa, L.;Dondi, M.",2012-08-31,Ceramics International,"A.

High velocity oxygen fuel sprayed Cr3C2-NiCr coatings against Na2SO4 hot corrosion at different temperatures,"Cr3C2-NiCr/NiCrAlY coating was prepared by high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) spraying. The microstructure and the Na2SO4 hot corrosion behavior at different temperatures of the coating were investigated. The Na2SO4 hot corrosion mechanism of Cr3C2-NiCr coating was also discussed. The results showed that HVOF Cr3C2-NiCr coating was relatively dense and mainly composed of Cr3C2, NiCr and a small amount of Cr7C3 three phases. The dense Cr2O3 layer was formed on the surface of Cr3C2-NiCr coating after Na2SO4 corrosion at 750 °C to further prevent corrosion. The coating had produced the obvious longitudinal crack with the increase of hot corrosion temperature up to 900 °C. The corrosion mechanism of Cr3C2-NiCr coating against the Na2SO4 salt at high-temperature was as follows: firstly, the protective oxidizing film was formed at 750 °C, then the protective oxide film dissolved at the interface between the coating and Na2SO4 salt with the hot corrosion temperature increasing up to 900 °C, and subsequently the dissolved anions and cations could migrate to the interface between molten salt and air and the loose and unprotected oxides were regenerated, thereby exacerbating the failure of the coating.","Shi, Mengchuan;Xue, Zhaolu;Liang, Heping;Yan, Zupeng;Liu, Xia;Zhang, Shihong",2020-10-15,Ceramics International,"High velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF),Cr3C2-NiCr coating,Na2SO4,Hot corrosion mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.135,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.135
Possibilities of the Computer-Controlled Detonation Spraying method: A chemistry viewpoint,"This article is aimed to discuss the chemical aspects of detonation spraying of powder materials. In this method of coating deposition, ceramic, metallic or composite powders are injected into the barrel of a detonation gun filled with an explosive gaseous mixture. When the latter is ignited, the powders are heated and accelerated toward the substrate. Subjected to high temperatures, the powders are prone to chemical reactions, the reaction products possibly becoming the major phase constituents of the coatings. What types of reactions are possible? Can these reactions be carried out in a controlled manner? We answer these questions considering the interactions of the sprayed powders with the gaseous environment of the barrel as well as those between the phases of a composite feedstock powder. In Computer-Controlled Detonation Spraying (CCDS), the explosive charge and stoichiometry of the fuel-oxygen mixtures are precisely measured and can be flexibly changed. Our studies demonstrate that with the introduction of a highly flexible process of CCDS, detonation spraying has entered a new development stage, at which it can be considered as a powerful method of composition and microstructure tailoring of thermally sprayed coatings. During CCDS of TiO2-containing powders, chemical reduction of titanium dioxide can be carried out to different levels to form either oxygen-deficient TiO2−x or Ti3O5 suboxide. CCDS of Ti3Al can produce titanium oxide coatings when oxidation by the detonation products dominates or titanium nitride-titanium aluminide coatings when oxidation is hindered but the interaction of the powders with nitrogen—a carrier gas component—is favored. During detonation spraying of Ti3SiC2–Cu composites, the Ti3SiC2 phase is preserved only in cold conditions; otherwise, Si de-intercalates from the Ti3SiC2 phase and dissolves in Cu resulting in the formation of the TiC x –Cu(Si) composite coatings.","Dudina, Dina V.;Batraev, Igor S.;Ulianitsky, Vladimir Yu.;Korchagin, Michail A.",2014-03-31,Ceramics International,"Detonation spraying,Coatings,Oxides,Intermetallics,Metal–ceramic composite",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.09.111,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.09.111
Laser deposition of compositionally graded titanium oxide on Ti6Al4V alloy,"In this study, a laser cladding process was developed to deposit dense and well-adhered titanium single tracks on the surface of Ti6Al4V alloy with a compositional and microstructural gradient. CuO doped, freeze-dried anatase powder was specially formulated for this process. The addition of CuO resulted in stable melt pool with low viscosity, low surface tension and enhanced wettability with the substrate. Continuous titanium oxide single tracks were formed with a cross-sectional profile that was advantageous for coating deposition by means of multiple overlapping scan tracks. Rapid heating and cooling associated with laser cladding produced unique solidified microstructures with a compositional gradient. No structurally critical fractures were observed in the graded oxide layers, or at the coating/substrate interfaces. Furthermore, a transition zone of oxide/metal mixture was observed at the interface, increasing the effective bonding area between the coating and the substrate.","Lu, Mingyuan;McCormick, Paul;Zhao, Yitian;Fan, Zhiqi;Huang, Han",2018-12-01,Ceramics International,"Ceramic coating,Titanium oxide,Laser cladding,Rapid solidification",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.090,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.090
Synthesis of yttria by aqueous sol-gel route to develop anti-CMAS coatings for the protection of EBPVD thermal barriers,"Anti-CMAS yttria coatings have been prepared by sol-gel routes. Yttria powders with controlled morphology are prepared via auto-combustion of yttrium precursors in a polymerized matrix. The influence of key parameters of the water-based sols is assessed. Indeed, the pH of the initial sol and the temperature of thermal treatment play a major role in the morphology and grain size of yttria powders. To prevent infiltration of CMAS, yttria powders are proposed to be synthesized at pH=1 of the aqueous sol, with drying of the sol and heating at 900°C. After optimization of the synthesis and deposition conditions via sol-gel route, yttria-based coatings with high specific surface area are obtained. They promote the interaction with melt CMAS and consequently limit the degradation of the thermal barrier coatings situated underneath. It was proved that anti-CMAS yttria coating is effective against the infiltration of CMAS at 1250°C for 15min and even 1h.","Delon, E.;Ansart, F.;Duluard, S.;Bonino, J.P.;Malié, A.;Joulia, A.;Gomez, P.",2016-09-30,Ceramics International,"Anti-CMAS coating,Yttria,Inorganic or colloidal sol-gel,Alkoxide route,Morphology control",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.169,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.169
Rheological properties of aqueous alumina–alumina-doped Y-PSZ suspensions,"The effect of the substitution of alumina (Al2O3) by 0.3wt% Al2O3-doped 3mol% yttria-partially stabilized zirconia (Y-PSZ) on the rheological properties of concentrated aqueous slips was studied. Al2O3–Al2O3-doped Y-PSZ aqueous suspensions with different Al2O3-doped Y-PSZ contents: 0, 22 and 50vol% were prepared using ammonium polyacrylate (NH4PA) as dispersant. The particle size distributions of Al2O3 and Al2O3-doped Y-PSZ powders were similar; however, the particle shape and the surface coating of alumina conferred a markedly higher specific surface area to the Al2O3-doped Y-PSZ powder. The substitution of Al2O3 by Al2O3-doped Y-PSZ in the mixtures decreased the negative surface charge of the powders at pH 9, thereby increasing the amount of NH4PA adsorbed and consequently the electrosteric repulsion between particles. However, the viscosity and yield stress values increased with increasing Al2O3-doped Y-PSZ content for all the solid loading studied. This could be explained by a larger interaction size of the Al2O3-doped Y-PSZ particles which resulted in a higher effective volume solid fraction and a lower amount of free-liquid available for flow.","Calambás Pulgarin, Heidy L.;Garrido, Liliana B.;Albano, María P.",2012-04-30,Ceramics International,"Al2O3–Al2O3-doped Y-PSZ suspensions,Dispersion,Rheological properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.10.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.10.009
The crystallization behaviours of reactive-plasma-sprayed TiCN coatings with different Ti/graphite powder ratios,"TiCN coatings were reactive plasma sprayed with different Ti/graphite powder ratios. Their crystallization behaviours were investigated. The results showed that the TiN coating consisted of TiN and TiN0.3O phases. With the decrease in the Ti/graphite ratios, the phases in the coatings changed from TiC0.7N0.3+TiC0.3N0.7+amorphous (Ti:graphite = (6-10):1) to TiC0.3N0.7 + TiC + amorphous (Ti:graphite = 4:1). The surface of the TiN coating exhibited the columnar crystals. With the decrease in the Ti/graphite ratios, the columnar crystals gradually skewed towards the surface. The cross-section crystalline morphologies of all the coatings exhibited the layer-layer columnar crystals with better bonding interfaces between the layers. The micro-hardness of the sprayed TiN coating was 1000 HV0.1. The micro-hardness of the TiCN coatings increased with the decrease in the Ti/graphite ratios. The maximum microhardness (1315 HV0.1) was observed at a Ti/graphite ratio of 4:1, approximately 30% higher than that of the TiN coating. The increase in the micro-hardness was correlated with the phase composition and crystalline morphologies.","Guo, Fangfang;Bi, Yehui;Li, Chao;Zhu, Lingyan;He, Jining;Dong, Yanchun;Yang, Yong;Zhao, Hongjian;Qin, Yanfang;Yin, Fuxing",2020-10-15,Ceramics International,"TiCN coating,Reactive plasma spraying,Ti/graphite powder ratio,Crystallization,Micro-hardness",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.121,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.121
Role of water in the sol-gel synthesis of yttrium monosilicate,"Yttrium monosilicate (YMS) is a candidate environmental barrier coating material. It is a line compound, and its synthesis requires strict stoichiometric control of the starting materials. In this work, YMS was synthesised by the sol-gel method. Yttrium oxide and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) were used as precursors. The ratio of water to ethanol was varied to study the role of water in the formation of phase-pure YMS. The formation of secondary phases during synthesis was attributed to the complex interaction of TEOS with water in the presence of ethanol. It was seen that water and ethanol play a significant role in aqueous sol-gel processes involving silica than merely being present as solvents. The results are helpful in identifying the suitable sol-gel parameters for the synthesis of phase-pure yttrium monosilicate.","Raghunandan, S.;Kumar, R.

High-temperature oxidation and hot corrosion behavior of Er2Sn2O7 + Inconel 625 composite,"In this work, a strategically designed method is employed to attain the oxidation and hot corrosion rate constants of thermal barrier oxide materials without being developed as coatings. For this, low thermal conducting oxide, Er2Sn2O7 is considered as thermal barrier oxide material and blended with metallic Inconel 625 in 1:1 wt ratio to make composite. The oxidation and hot corrosion experiments conducted on bare Inconel 625, Er2Sn2O7 + 50 wt % In 625 and YSZ +50 wt % In 625 samples.

Thermal stability and mechanical properties of HVOF/PVD duplex ceramic coatings produced by HVOF and cathodic vacuum arc,"Duplex ceramic coatings, consisting of an inner NiCr-Cr3C2-based coating and an outmost AlCrN film, were produced on the steel substrate in succession by velocity oxygen-fuel spraying (HVOF) and cathodic vacuum arc methods, and then isochronally annealed at annealing temperatures below 900°C for 2h. The thermal stability and mechanical properties of the annealed samples were systematically studied by means of X-ray diffraction, Optical microscope and transmission electron microscope, in association with mechanical property measurements. The results show that the microstructure, phase evolution and mechanical properties of duplex ceramic coatings are significantly dependent on the annealing temperature. Metastable fcc-AlCrN solid solution in AlCrN film first decomposes to rich-Al and rich-Cr domains by spinodal decomposition at 700°C, leading to a notable increase in hardness due to its smaller grain size and high elastic strain field, and then to equiaxed hcp-AlN and Cr2N by the nucleation and growth at 900°C, leading to a notable decrease in hardness due to the recrystallization and the formation of hcp-AlN. Meanwhile, the both decarburization of Cr3C2 to Cr7C3 occurs at 800°C, but becomes more intensive at 900°C, leading to a notable loss in hardness. In addition, the dissolution of Cr3C2 produces high density of porosity, which also reduces the hardness. The hardness tests show the following ordering of load-bearing capacity for the duplex ceramic coatings: 700°C>As-deposited >800°C>900°C. Tribological property measurements demonstrate that the wear resistance of the tested duplex ceramic coatings obeys the following ordering: 700°C>As-deposited >800°C>900°C. The improved wear resistance is due to high surface hardness, load-bearing capacity and thermal stability. In addition, the wear mechanisms are shown.","Chen, Wanglin;Fang, Bo;Zhang, Daoda;Meng, Xianna;Zhang, Shihong",2017-07-31,Ceramics International,"NiCr-Cr3C2-based coating,AlCrN film,Duplex ceramic coating,Thermal stability,Mechanical property",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.02.151,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.02.151

Influence of processing route on microstructure and mechanical properties of MgAl2O4 spinel,"This paper reports on process dependant microstructural and mechanical properties of MgAl2O4 spinel (MAS) ceramics. Two MAS powders with different chemical compositions were synthesized by solid-state reaction of alumina and calcined caustic magnesia at 1400°C for 1h. The surface of the as obtained MAS powders was passivated against hydrolysis by coating it with H3PO4 and Al(H2PO4)3 species dissolved in ethanol at 80°C for 24h. The as protected powders could then be dispersed in aqueous solutions of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) and Duramax D-3005 as dispersing agents to obtain stable slurries with 45vol.% solids loading. The stable aqueous MAS slurries were consolidated by slip casting (SC), gelcasting (GC), hydrolysis assisted solidification (HAS) and hydrolysis induced aqueous gelcasting (GCHAS) routes, fully dried and then sintered for 1h at 1650°C. For comparison purposes, dense MAS ceramics were also prepared following a conventional dry-powder pressing (DP) and temperature induced gelation (TIG) routes. All the sintered MAS ceramics were thoroughly characterized for bulk density, apparent porosity, water absorption capacity, SEM microstructure, XRD phase, hardness, 3-point bend strength, and percentage of shrinkage to evaluate the suitability of the processing routes for fabricating defect free components with near-net shape. Among the various techniques employed, the GCHAS was found to be best for fabricating near-net shape MAS ceramics.","Ganesh, Ibram;Jaganatha Reddy, G.;Sundararajan, G.;Olhero, Susana M.;Torres, Paula M.C.;Ferreira, José M.F.",2010-03-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Synthesis of a TiO2 ceramic membrane containing SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3 by the sol–gel method with a wet impregnation process for O2 and N2 permeation,"A SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3 impregnated TiO2 membrane (TiO2–SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3 membrane) was successfully prepared using a sol–gel method in combination with a wet impregnation process. The membrane was subjected to a single gas permeance test using oxygen (O2) and nitrogen (N2). The TiO2 membrane was immersed in the SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3 solution, dried and then calcined to affix SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3 into the membrane. The effect of the acid/alkoxide (H+/Ti4+) molar ratio of the TiO2 sol on the TiO2 phase transformation was investigated. The optimal molar ratio was found to be 0.5, which resulted in nanoparticles with a mean size of 5.30nm after calcination at 400°C. The effect of calcination temperature on the phase transformation of TiO2 and SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3 was investigated by varying the calcination temperature from 300 to 500°C. X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis confirmed that a calcination temperature of 400°C was preferable for preparing a TiO2–SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3 membrane with fully crystallized anatase and SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3 phases. The results also showed that polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) were completely removed. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) analysis results showed that a crack-free and relatively dense TiO2 membrane (∼0.75μm thickness) was created with a multiple dip-coating process and calcination at 400°C. The gas permeation results show that the TiO2 and TiO2–SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3 membranes exhibited high permeances. The TiO2–SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3 membrane developed provided greater O2/N2 selectivity compared to the TiO2 membrane alone.","Ahmad, Abdul Latif;Abdullah Sani, Nur Aimie;Sharif Zein, Sharif Hussein",2011-12-31,Ceramics International,"D.

Development of HA-CNTs composite coating on AZ31 magnesium alloy by cathodic electrodeposition. Part 1: Microstructural and mechanical characterization,"Magnesium alloys are considered as a new class of biodegradable alloys having many favorable properties to overcome the problems of currently used biomedical materials. Hydroxyapatite (HA) containing carbon nano-tubes (CNTs), with concentration ranging from 0 to 1.5 wt.%, coated on AZ31 magnesium alloy by direct and pulse cathodic electrodeposition methods. The coating properties including phase analysis, chemical bonding, morphology, and thickness were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), respectively. Nano-indentation, micro-hardness and adhesion tests were also used to evaluate the mechanical properties of the coatings. The results showed that a dense and fine coating structure was obtained by pulse deposition method. Moreover, the presence of carbon nanotubes in composite coating increased crystallization, presumably due to the increase in nucleation sites affecting the growth direction of hydroxyapatite crystals. The optimum condition having high crystallinity (71.2%) along with an uniform structure was the pulse deposited hydroxyapatite coating containing 1 wt.% CNTs. The elastic modulus and hardness of this sample increased by approximately 42% and 130% compared to the pure HA coating, respectively.

A model of splats deposition state and wear resistance of WC-10Co4Cr coating,"In this research both low temperature high velocity oxygen-fuel flame (LT-HVOF) and high velocity oxygen-fuel flame (HVOF) techniques were employed to prepare WC-10Co4Cr splats and coatings. In situ cutting of WC-10Co-4Cr splats was carried out with focused ion beam (FIB), and a model was proposed to describe how the wear resistance of WC-10Co4Cr coatings was correlated with its residual stress state and the splats deposition state. It was observed that in LT-HVOF spraying process, WC-10Co4Cr splats were slightly melted showing ""hill"" shape, while in HVOF spraying process, the splats were half melted having the appearance of ""concavity"". The residual stress of WC-10Co4Cr coatings is determined by the size, melting state, flight speed and temperature gradient of splats. In this paper, the quantitative function formula involving heating temperature and the flight speed of the powder is put forward for the first time to predict the wear resistance of the WC-10Co4Cr coatings. This will provide a theoretical basis for engineering practice and an effective way to save costs.","Han, Tao;Deng, Chunming;Zhang, Xiaofeng;Liu, Qiao",2018-03-31,Ceramics International,"Focused ion beam (FIB),Low temperature high velocity oxygen-fuel flame (LT-HVOF),High velocity oxygen-fuel flame (HVOF),Residual stress,Wear resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.003
Determination of certain sol-gel growth parameters of nickel oxide films,"In present work, NiO thin films were fabricated by sol-gel spin coating technique depending on precursor concentration, annealing temperature and solvent type. Crystallographic, morphological and optical features of films were inquired by XRD, AFM and UV/VIS measurements. The XRD studies pointed that films had nickel oxide cubic structure with (200) preferential orientation and the crystallinity of films depended on deposition conditions. The AFM pictures showed the films were composed of well-formed nano particles. From AFM analysis, it was also found that deposited films had quite smooth surfaces. The optical measurements indicated that the transmittance and optical band gap values continuously decreased with the increasing precursor molarity, however they initially increased with the annealing temperature up to 550°C and then dropped off with more increasing annealing temperature. For 2-methoxyethanol, methanol and water solvents, the highest optical transmittance and optical band gap values were found for methanol solvent. The findings in our study suggest that the characteristic properties of NiO films strongly depend on the deposition conditions of sol-gel spin coating. NiO films with good structural, morphological and optical properties can be also used in various technological applications.","Turgut, G.;Sonmez, E.;Duman, S.",2015-03-31,Ceramics International,"XRD,Nickel oxide,Annealing,Molarity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.10.133,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.10.133
Superior lithium storage performance of hierarchical N-doped carbon encapsulated NaTi2(PO4)3 microflower,"Na-superionic conductor (NASICON) structured NaTi2(PO4)3 (NTP) as anode shows broad prospect in aqueous lithium ion battery. However, inherent low electrical conductivity of NaTi2(PO4)3 remains a pivotal issue to be resolved. Herein, we report N-doped carbon encapsulated NaTi2(PO4)3 microflower (NTP-CN) as anode for aqueous lithium ion battery, which is prepared via solvothermal way. NTP-CN with unique structural feature displays superb electrochemical performances. It delivers the discharge capacities of 131.2, 110.1, and 84.3 mAh g−1 at 0.2, 3.0, and 15 C, respectively, 38.8, 33.8, and 51.1 mAh g−1 higher than these of pristine NTP. NTP-CN also shows remarkable cycling stability at 6 C after 1000 cycles (capacity retention: 88.8%), superior to NTP (70.7%). The outstanding properties of NTP-CN may be due to that microflower structure can increase touching area between electrolyte and electrode, and carbon coating for electrode improves stability in aqueous electrolyte and ameliorates electrical conductivity. Moreover, nitrogen doping can further enhance hydrophilicity and conductivity of the sample, and also form lots of defects on electrode surface, which is beneficial for the intercalation/deintercalation of Li ions. This work reveals that the combination of microflower structure and N-doped carbon layer offers a promising method to improve electrochemical performances of NaTi2(PO4)3.","Jiang, Zhen;Li, Yuehua;Han, Chao;He, Zhangxing;Ma, Wenjin;Meng, Wei;Jiang, Yingqiao;Dai, Lei;Wang, Ling",2020-02-01,Ceramics International,"Aqueous lithium ion battery,Anode,NaTi2(PO4)3,Nitrogen doping,Electrochemical performance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.174,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.174
The use of a diatomite–kaolin composite coating to design the pore characteristics of a sintered diatomite membrane,"Porous ceramic membranes have lately attracted great interest due to their outstanding thermal and chemical stability. In this paper, we report the results of our efforts to determine whether we could prepare a diatomite–kaolin composite coating to be deposited over a sintered diatomite support layer that could reduce the largest pore size of the sintered diatomite membrane while retaining an acceptable level of permeability. We determined under what conditions such a composite coating over a support layer could be prepared without the generation of micro-cracks during drying and sintering. The pore characteristics of the sintered diatomite membranes were studied by scanning electron microscopy and capillary flow porosimetry.","Ha, Jang-Hoon;Oh, Eunji;Song, In-Hyuck",2014-01-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Titanium oxide – reduced graphene oxide – silver composite layers synthesized by laser technique: Wetting and electrical properties,"Electrically conductive and highly hydrophobic surface layers are attractive for many practical applications. In this work the functional, wetting and electrical properties of titanium dioxide (TiO2), TiO2/silver (Ag), and TiO2/reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/Ag nanocomposite coatings layers are reported. The functional properties of the layers were correlated with their chemical composition and bonding states between the constituent elements, determined in turn by the synthesis and immobilization process parameters. The nanocomposite coatings were obtained by matrix assisted pulsed laser evaporation, a laser-based environmental friendly thin film deposition technique. The synthesized ternary TiO2/rGO/Ag coatings has optimum performances, highly hydrophobic character and low electrical resistance, attributed to the presence of Ag nanoparticles and to the reduction of the oxygen containing functional groups of the GO platelets during laser irradiation and transfer processes leading to the formation of graphene-like material.","György, E.;del Pino, A.

An isothermal oxidation behaviour of atmospheric plasma and high-velocity oxy-fuel sprayed nickel based coating,"This paper describes the isothermal oxidation behaviour of NiCrBSiFe coatings on SS 316 L deposited by the atmospheric plasma (APS) and high-velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) processes. As-sprayed coatings were oxidised isothermally in the air at 900 °C temperature for 1000 h. The thermogravimetric analysis was performed to measure the oxidation rate. The coating and oxide scale characterisation was carried out using SEM, EDAX, XRD, porosity analysis, and nanoindentation. The HVOF sprayed NiCrBSiFe coating shows better oxidation resistance than the APS coating, due to high density, less porosity, and formation of more protective oxide scale.","Rukhande, Sanjay W.;Rathod, Walmik S.",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"NiCrBSiFe,Isothermal oxidation,APS,HVOF",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.155,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.155
Assessment of SnO2-nanocrystal-based luminescent glass-ceramic waveguides for integrated photonics,"For integrated photonics, waveguide structures based on rare-earth-activated glasses are potential candidates for implementing compact integrated light sources and amplifiers. However, rare-earth ions (REs) possess low absorption cross-section, and this limits the light emission and amplification efficiency. As long as the REs are involved, there are other phenomena detrimental to their luminescence quantum yield including ion-ion interactions and non-radiative relaxation processes. To solve such problems, photonic glass-ceramics can be strategic solutions. Transparent glass-ceramics combine interesting properties of both amorphous and crystalline phases and offer specific characteristics of capital importance in photonics. More important, photonic glass-ceramics can tailor and enhance the spectroscopic properties of the rare-earth ions depending on their compositions and nature. In this work, we studied SnO2-nanocrystal-based transparent glass-ceramic planar waveguides activated by rare-earths to give solutions for the problems mentioned above and enhance the rare-earth luminescence efficiency for integrated photonics. SiO2–SnO2:Er3+ planar waveguides containing 30 mol% SnO2 nanocrystals were fabricated by sol-gel method and dip-coating technique. The planar waveguides were assessed by various characterization techniques to ensure the applicability of such glass-ceramics for integrated photonics. The experimental assessment of the SiO2–SnO2:Er3+ planar waveguides focused on the key considered photonic characteristics including the structural, morphological, spectroscopic, and especially optical waveguiding properties. The photoluminescence measurements put in evidence the role of SnO2 nanocrystals as efficient Er3+ luminescence sensitizers. Moreover, the incorporation of Er3+ ions in SnO2 nanocrystals was demonstrated to reduce the effect of non-radiative relaxation processes on the luminescence of the Er3+ ions and thus led to higher luminescence efficiency. Majority of the Er3+ ions (97%) was confirmed to be imbedded in the SnO2 nanocrystals. The SiO2–SnO2:Er3+ glass-ceramic planar waveguides have confined propagation modes, step-index profile with high confinement of 82% at 1542 nm and especially, low losses of 0.6 ± 0.2 dB/cm at 1542 nm.","Tran, Thi Ngoc Lam;Armellini, Cristina;Varas, Stefano;Carpentiero, Alessandro;Chiappini, Andrea;Głuchowski, Paweł;Iacob, Erica;Ischia, Gloria;Scotognella, Francesco;Bollani, Monica;Lukowiak, Anna;Righini, Giancarlo C.;Ferrari, Maurizio;Chiasera, Alessandro",2020-10-22,Ceramics International,"SiO2-SnO2:Er3+,Rare-earth luminescence sensitizers,Transparent glass-ceramics,Luminescent planar waveguides,Nanocomposites,Sol-gel",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.137,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.137

The phase composition, microstructure and mechanical properties of both (ZrC and ZrC0.85) coatings were studied. X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed the formation of cubic ZrC. A strong (200) texture normal to the substrate surface was observed in both coatings which were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed ZrC to be the main phase in both coatings with ∼5.5mol% ZrO2 minor phase. In stoichiometric ZrC coating, both Young's modulus (312±9GPa) and hardness (25±3.1GPa) were higher compared to the non-stoichiometric ZrC0.85 coating.","Long, Ying;Javed, Athar;Chen, Jie;Chen, Zhao-ke;Xiong, Xiang",2014-01-31,Ceramics International,"C.

A modified sol–gel method using acetone–ethanol mixed solvent for fast constructing nanometric TiO2 shells,"We successfully constructed uniform and complete TiO2 shells on SiO2 cores in a short reaction time (2h) and obtained the core–shell particles with high dispersibility. In this modified sol–gel method, the adopting of ethanol–acetone mixed solvent was critical and advantageous for the fast formation of TiO2 shells. When acetone was controlled at an optimum fraction in solvent (acetone:ethanol=1.2:1v/v), it not only increased the hydrolysis rate of precursor (i.e., titanium (IV) tetrabutoxide) and the condensation rate of titanium oligomers, but also regulated these two sub-reactions of TiO2 formation to be in balance – and thus suppressed the occurrence of agglomeration during TiO2 coating. In addition, the influence of the concentration of catalyst NH3 and precursor titanium (IV) tetrabutoxide was also investigated. Furthermore, the thickness of TiO2 shells on 366nm SiO2 cores was varied from 30 to 107nm by simply adjust the addition volume of precursor, as the regulation role of acetone was widely applicable for different concentration of precursor. Finally, the obtained TiO2 shells were proved to be able to crystallize to anatase shells by calcination, while the core–shell structure showed high stability at high temperature.","Chen, Wanghui;Takai, Chika;Khosroshahi, Hadi Razavi;Fuji, Masayoshi;Shirai, Takashi",2016-01-31,Ceramics International,"A.

"Ni-free, black ceramic pigments based on Co—Cr—Fe—Mn spinels: A reappraisal of crystal structure, colour and technological behaviour","A reappraisal of crystal structure, optical properties and technological behaviour of black spinels in the Co—Cr—Fe—Mn system was carried out to define the best compositions and disclose the role of crystal chemistry in colouring performance and pigment-glaze interactions. Twenty ternary and quaternary spinel formulations were designed using crystallochemical criteria and prepared by simulating the industrial synthesis. Powder samples were characterized through X-ray diffraction (Rietveld), optical, Raman and Mössbauer spectroscopies, and technological testing in several glazes and glassy coatings. Black spinels fall in a relatively narrow field of unit cell and inversion parameters in between “chromites” and “magnetites”. Their cation distribution is governed by Co2+ occupancy of tetrahedrally-coordinated site T and Cr3+ occupancy of octahedrally-coordinated site M, with Mn3+ hosted at M, while Mn2+ and Fe3+ are distributed over both sites. Nevertheless, Raman and Mössbauer spectra indicate a growing disorder in cation partitioning going towards the iron-rich terms. The pigment technological behaviour depends to a large extent on crystal chemistry of spinels, with no effect by grain or crystallite size. The best colouring performance corresponds to recommended compositions able to withstand corrosion and change in crystal chemistry in contact with melted glaze. Three different pathways can give rise to excellent black pigments: (a) strongly disordered spinels having an inversion parameter i∼0.2; (b) moderately disordered spinels, free of Mn3+, with i<0.1; (c) apparently ordered and normal spinels halfway from cobalt chromite and cobalt ferrite. Poor technological performances are due to different conditions leaving room to colour bleaching (low Cr amount), glaze bloating (excess of Mn3+) and limited resistance to corrosion (oversaturation of site M by Cr+Fe with formation of kenotetrahedral spinels or eskolaite—hematite solid solutions).","Dondi, Michele;Zanelli, Chiara;Ardit, Matteo;Cruciani, Giuseppe;Mantovani, Luciana;Tribaudino, Mario;Andreozzi, Giovanni B.",2013-12-31,Ceramics International,"Ceramic pigment,Crystal chemistry,Crystal structure,Mössbauer spectroscopy,Raman spectroscopy",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.05.072,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.05.072
Design and optimization of coating structure for plasma sprayed self-healing MgO coating via finite element method,"The necessary conditions for fabricating plasma sprayed self-healing MgO coating with excellent performance is to find an optimized coating structure with suitable thickness of each layer, self-healing agent content and low residual stress. This paper discusses the design and optimization of a suitable coating structure for the self-healing MgO coating prepared by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) using the finite element method (FEM). Through the stress analysis of the special points of the coating and interface, a suitable coating structure is designed. The optimization of the coating structure mainly includes the thickness of the coating, the analysis of the composition of the coating and the analysis of the effect of convective heat transfer coefficient (CHTC) on the residual stress of the coating. The failure modes are predicted. The spray thickness of each layer and the fabrication method in the coating cooling process are optimized.","Zhuang, Mingxiang;Yuan, Jianhui;Hu, Zhongchao;Li, Guangshu;Zhang, Huanyu;Zhang, Jiajia;Huang, Bin;Wang, Liang",2020-09-11,Ceramics International,"Self-healing MgO coating,Finite element method,Crucible,Structural optimization,Failure mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.084,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.084
Self-propagating combustion synthesis and plasma spraying deposition of TiC–Fe powders,"The synthesis of titanium carbide/iron composite from elemental powders by means of self-propagating reactions to be subsequently employed for plasma spray deposition is investigated. The combustion temperature and velocity of propagating front are found to decrease as the amount of iron in the starting mixture increased. In addition, the maximum value of the iron content in the initial mixture allowable for guaranteeing the self-propagating character of the combustion synthesis process is identified. Below this threshold, i.e. 60 wt.%, independently of the iron content, the final products resulted constituted by titanium carbide and iron, being the latter one found as a binder distributed around the carbide grains. In particular, a strong dependence of the grains size of the obtained titanium carbide on the iron content is observed. Once reduced in powder form, the obtained composite, specifically TiC–30 wt.% Fe, is subsequently used for thermal spraying coatings deposition. Adhesion performance, hardness and wear resistance tests results for the obtained coatings by vacuum plasma spraying are also reported.","Licheri, Roberta;Orrù, Roberto;Cao, Giacomo;Crippa, Angelo;Scholz, Reinhard",2003-12-31,Ceramics International,"Coating preparation,Plasma spraying,TiC–Fe powders,Self-propagating,Combustion synthesis",10.1016/S0272-8842(02)00196-7,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0272-8842(02)00196-7
The sintering behavior of plasma-sprayed YSZ coating over the delamination crack in low temperature environment,"The sintering behavior of plasma-sprayed yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) coating over the delamination crack and its influence on YSZ cracking were investigated via gradient thermal cycling test and finite element model (FEM). The gradient thermal cycling test was performed at a peak surface temperature of 1150°C with a duration of 240s for each cycle. A three-dimensional model including delamination cracks with different lengths was employed to elaborate the temperature evolution characteristics in YSZ coating over the delamination cracks. The temperature over the delamination crack increases linearly with the crack propagation, which continuously promotes the sintering of YSZ coating in the region. As a result, the YSZ coating over the delamination crack sinters dramatically despite of the low temperature exposure. Meanwhile, the temperature distribution difference in YSZ coating induces an nonuniform sintering along both free surface and thickness of YSZ coating. Correspondingly, the maximum vertical crack driving force locates at the YSZ free surface over the delamination crack center, which makes the vertical cracks generate in this region and propagate to the interface of YSZ /bond coat with YSZ further sintering. The vertical crack promotes the delamination crack propagation via accelerating the oxidation velocity of the bond coat. The influence of temperature rise on delamination crack propagation can be divided into two stages: the little contribution stage and the promotion stage. For the actual engine exposure to low temperature, the study of phase transformation of YSZ over the delamination crack is indeed needed because of an extended remarkable temperature rise period.","Dong, Hui;Yao, Jian-Tao;Li, Xiao;Zhou, Yong;Li, Yuan-Bo",2018-02-15,Ceramics International,"Plasma spraying,Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs),Low temperature exposure,Sintering behavior,Temperature variation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.113,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.113
Surface modification of LiCoO2 with Li3x La2/3−x TiO3 for all-solid-state lithium ion batteries using Li2S–P2S5 glass–ceramic,"To improve the electrochemical performance of all-solid-state cells using LiCoO2, a nano-sized lithium lanthanum titanate (Li3x La2/3−x TiO3; LLTO) coating is employed to modify the surface of LiCoO2 via a sol–gel process. The crystalline structure of pristine LiCoO2 is not affected by the coating process, and nano-sized LLTO particles uniformly adhere to the surface of the LiCoO2 particle. All-solid-state cells with an In/78Li2S·22P2S5/LiCoO2 structure were constructed and tested by charge and discharge cycling at a current density of 0.06mAcm−2 with a cut off voltage of 1.9–3.68V (vs. Li–In). The all-solid-state cell using LiCoO2 modified with 0.05wt% of Li0.75La0.42TiO3 shows the highest reversible capacity and capacity retention during all cycles. The Li3x La2/3−x TiO3 coatings are effective in reducing the charge-transfer resistance and electrode polarization by control of the composition and coating amount of Li3x La2/3−x TiO3 because a side reaction between the interface of LiCoO2 and 78Li2S·22P2S5 glass–ceramic solid electrolyte can be suppressed.","Noh, Sungwoo;Kim, Junghoon;Eom, Minyong;Shin, Dongwook",2013-09-30,Ceramics International,"All-solid-state lithium ion battery,Solid electrolyte,Lithium lanthanum titanate,Surface modification",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.04.027,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.04.027
Effect of polishing method on surface roughness and bacterial adhesion of zirconia-porcelain veneer,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of various polishing methods on surface roughness of zirconia-porcelain veneer and to correlate the findings with early bacterial adhesion. The study specimens were glazed (control group), glazed after fine polishing (glazed group) and polished with Exa Cerapol (Cerapol group) or with Shofu porcelain adjustment kit (Shofu group) (n =20). Surface roughness was then measured using profilometer and scanning electron microscope (SEM). After artificial saliva coating, the specimens were incubated in Streptococcus mitis suspension for 4h at 37°C. Adherent bacteria were quantified from SEM images. Streptococcal viability was assessed by LIVE/DEAD staining kit and fluorescent microscope. There were significant differences in surface roughness according to polishing method and surface material. Relatively smoother surfaces were found in zirconia surfaces and glazed porcelain surfaces. There were also significant differences in bacterial adhesion according to polishing method and surface material. Cerapol group showed minimal bacterial adhesion with more dead cells when compared to other groups. A positive correlation between surface roughness and bacterial adhesion was found in glazed porcelain surface and a negative correlation in zirconia surface of Cerapol group, both with no statistical significance. Within the limitations of in vitro study, surface roughness and bacteria adhesion were significantly influenced by polishing method and surface material. Also, there was a positive correlation and negative correlation between surface roughness and bacterial adhesion in glazed porcelain surface and in zirconia surface of Cerapol group, respectively.","Kang, Doo-Hwa;Choi, Hyunmin;Yoo, Yun-Jung;Kim, Jae-Hong;Park, Young-Bum;Moon, Hong-Seok",2017-05-31,Ceramics International,"Bacterial adhesion,Zirconia,Surface roughness,Sreptococcus mitis,Scanning electron microscopy,LIVE/DEAD staining",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.11.036,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.11.036
Dense thin YSZ electrolyte films prepared by a vacuum slurry deposition technique for SOFCs,"A novel vacuum deposition technique based on a slurry coating is proposed for the preparation of thin yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte films on a porous NiO-YSZ substrate for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). The vacuum pressure not only improved the packing density of the electrolyte particles but also enhanced the bonding strength between the anode and electrolyte layers. The polarization resistance of the cell prepared via vacuum deposition decreased from 1.27 to 0.89Ωcm2, which resulted in a remarkable increase in the peak power density from 249 to 292mWcm−2 at 800°C. An anode functional layer (AFL) was also fabricated by the vacuum slurry deposition method in an attempt to increase the three-phase boundaries (TPBs) at the anode/electrolyte interface. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed that the sintered YSZ electrolyte film has a crack-free, dense and homogeneous microstructure.

Oxidation behavior and microstructure evolution of SiC-ZrB2-ZrC coating for C/C composites at 1673K,"To protect carbon/carbon (C/C) composites against oxidation, a SiC-ZrB2-ZrC coating was prepared by the in-situ reaction between ZrC, B4C and Si. The thermogravimetric and isothermal oxidation results indicated the as-synthesized coating to show superior oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures, so it could effectively protect C/C composites for more than 221h at 1673K in air. The crystalline structure and morphology evolution of the multiphase SiC-ZrB2-ZrC coating were investigated. With the increase of oxidation time, the SiO2 oxide layer transformed from amorphous to crystalline. Flower-like and flake-like SiO2 structures were generated on the glass film during the oxidation process of SiC-ZrB2-ZrC coating, which might be ascribed to the varying concentration of SiO. The oxide scale presented a two-layered structure ~130µm thick after oxidation, consisting of a SiO2-rich glass layer containing ZrO2/ZrSiO4 particles and a Si-O-Zr layer.

Carbon-coated cation-disordered rocksalt-type transition metal oxide composites for high energy Li-ion batteries,"Li-excess cation-disordered rocksalt oxides have attracted extensive attention for their high capacity (>210 mA h g−1) and energy density. In these oxides, both cationic and anionic redox take responsibility for bringing capacity. However, anionic evolution as well as their intrinsic poor electronic conductivity raises the problem in large polarization and inferior rate performance of these oxides, especially for Ni-based ones. Herein, we report a facile strategy to synthesize a series of Li1·2Ni0·3Ti0·3Nb0·2O2 (LNTNO20) @ C using different mass ratios of carbon precursor and calcination temperatures. It is found that carbon-coated materials possess impressive electrochemical properties with both high specific capacity and rate performance. Specifically, Li1·2Ni0·3Ti0·3Nb0·2O2@C synthesized with ratio of 6:1 (LNTNO20: sucrose) and calcination temperature of 450 ○C exhibits an initial specific capacity of 268.2 mA h g−1 and a high capacity retention of 90.1% after 50 cycles. Based on multi-scale test results, we propose that carbon coating process using moderate mass ratio of carbon precursor and calcination temperature will increase tetrahedron height making Li diffuse easily. Besides, carbon coating layer reduces polarization upon cycling, protects cathode from reacting with electrolyte retarding SEI layer thickening and enhances electronic conductivity. Therefore, carbon coating is a facile and effective strategy to improve properties of Ni-based cation-disordered oxides.","Yu, Zhenlu;Qu, Xingyu;Dou, Aichun;Zhou, Yu;Su, Mingru;Liu, Yunjian",2020-09-03,Ceramics International,"Li1.2Ni0·3Ti0·3Nb0·2O2@C composite,Ionic conductivity,Li-ion batteries,Cation-disordered",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.001
Bioactive HA/TiO2 coating on magnesium alloy for biomedical applications,"Magnesium alloys are new class of biodegradable alloys having many favourable properties to overcome the limitations of currently used biomedical alloys. Recently, several coatings have been developed to overcome their higher degradation rate. In this regard, a new attempt has been made to develop Hydroxyapatite and Hydroxyapatite/TiO2 coatings on magnesium alloys to increase the biocompatibility and reduce the corrosion rate. The coated surfaces were characterized by Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray Diffraction Analysis (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) Spectroscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Contact angle measurements proved higher hydrophilic nature of HA/TiO2 coating compared to HA coating. In-vitro studies showed that HA–TiO2 coated alloy exhibited higher osteoinduction compared to HA coated alloy. Hydrogen evolution studies and corrosion studies confirmed greater reduction in degradation rate of HA/TiO2 coated alloy. Vickers microhardness test also showed enhancement in mechanical strength of the composite coated alloy compared to HA coated alloy. Three point bend test depicted better adherence of the HA/TiO2 coating compared to HA coating on the substrate. Cell culture studies proved higher cell attachment and proliferation on composite coated alloy by controlling the release of magnesium ions into the surrounding body tissue.","Amaravathy, P.;Sathyanarayanan, S.;Sowndarya, S.;Rajendran, N.",2014-06-30,Ceramics International,"A.

Ti2AlC MAX phase for resistance against CMAS attack to thermal barrier coatings,"To protect thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) from calcium-magnesium-alumina-silicate (CMAS) attack, depositing a protective layer has been a promising approach. In this study, a MAX phase compound, Ti2AlC, is found to highly resist to CMAS attack, which could be a candidate material for the protective layer. The interaction between Ti2AlC pellets and molten CMAS at 1250 °C for 0.5 h, 2 h and 8 h was investigated. Exposed to CMAS melt for 0.5 h, a dense Al2O3 film formed on the surface, accompanied by Al and Ti migrating to the melt. The accumulation of Al and Ti in CMAS triggered its crystallization, forming anorthite and melilite phases. The Al2O3 film and the crystallization of the melt significantly suppressed the CMAS penetration. The film and crystals grew with the heat time. By comparison, some pre-oxidized Ti2AlC pellets were also exposed to CMAS attack at 1250 °C. The CMAS on the pre-oxidized pellets only precipitated CaAl2Si2O8 anorthite crystals, which exhibited much lower sizes than those in the non-oxidized samples. Also, the pre-oxidized pellets were highly resistant to CMAS penetration.","Guo, Lei;Yan, Zheng;Wang, Xiaohui;He, Quanjun",2019-04-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs),Calcium-magnesium-alumina-silicate (CMAS),MAX phases,Ti2AlC,Protective layers",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.059,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.059
Sintering induced the failure behavior of dense vertically crack and lamellar structured TBCs with equivalent thermal insulation performance,"Both thermal cyclic lifetime and thermal barrier performance are essentially important to the application of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). In this study, equivalent thermal insulation conception is introduced to the design of TBCs to fairly compare different structured TBCs. Dense vertically crack (DVC) structured TBCs and the lamellar structured TBCs with same top coat thickness of 1000µm (D1000 and L1000), and lamellar structured TBCs with 570µm (L570, equivalent thermal insulation performance with D1000) top coat were prepared. Their lifetimes were evaluated under gradient thermal cyclic test. D1000 TBC shows a rather longer lifetime than L1000 TBC because of the alleviation of vertically cracks, but D1000 TBC possesses a much lower thermal barrier performance than L1000 TBC due to the dense structure of D1000 TBC. However, for the TBCs with the same equivalent thermal insulation performance, L570 TBC presents a more than two times longer lifetime than D1000 TBC. TGO thickening and phase transformation were proved not responsible for the failure of L1000 and D1000 TBCs in the present condition. The in-plane elastic modulus and Vickers hardness across top coat thickness were examined, and the results proved that the mechanical evolution of the top coat after high temperature exposure resulting in the competition between driving force and cracking resistance dominates the failure behavior of TBCs. This study is beneficial for the comprehensively understanding of the failure behavior of DVC and lamellar structured TBCs, and thereby shed light to further coating structure optimization and design innovation.","Cheng, Bo;Yang, Ning;Zhang, Qiang;zhang, Meng;Zhang, Yu-Ming;Chen, Lin;Yang, Guan-Jun;Li, Cheng-Xin;Li, Chang-Jiu",2017-12-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal cyclic lifetime,Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs),Plasma spray,Equivalent thermal insulation,Dense vertically crack (DVC)",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.092,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.092
Characterization of ‎bioactivity behavior and corrosion responses of hydroxyapatite-ZnO nanostructured coating deposited on ‎NiTi shape ‎memory alloy‎,"In this research, a ceramic combination of Hydroxyapatite and ZnO with a weight ratio of ‎‎50:50 was deposited on NiTi shape memory alloy by Electrophoretic Deposition Process ‎‎(EPD). Deposition of the Hydroxyapatite-ZnO on NiTi alloy was performed by applying 50 ‎volts for 100 s. The sintering operation was then conducted for 2 h in a furnace ‎under an argon atmosphere at 500 °C.

Microstructure and mechanical properties of Si3N4f/Si3N4 composites with different coatings,"The Si3N4 coating and Si3N4 coating with Si3N4 whiskers as reinforcement (Si3N4w-Si3N4) were prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on two-dimensional silicon nitride fiber reinforced silicon nitride ceramic matrix composites (2D Si3N4f/Si3N4 composites). The effects of process parameters of as-prepared coating including the preparation temperature and volume fraction of Si3N4w on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the composites were investigated.

The X-ray diffraction results show that two composite films possess BLTO and NMFO phases without any intermediate phase. The SEM images show that two composite films exhibit layered structure, clear interface and no transition layer between BLTO and NMFO films. Two composite films exhibit both good ferromagnetic and ferroelectric properties, as well as magnetoelectric coupling effect. The deposition sequence of ferroelectric and ferromagnetic films in the composite films has significant influence on the ferroelectric, ferromagnetic and magnetoelectric coupling properties of the composite films.

Design and synthesis of metal oxide hollow nanopowders for lithium-ion batteries by combining nanoscale Kirkendall diffusion and flame spray pyrolysis,"This study introduces an efficient process that combines a gas phase reaction method and nanoscale Kirkendall diffusion for the large-scale production of metal-oxide hollow nanopowders. Core-shell-structured NiO@SiO2 nanopowders prepared by flame spray pyrolysis are transformed into hollow NiO@SiO2 nanopowders via a nanoscale Kirkendall diffusion process. The SiO2 coating layer plays a key role in preventing the sintering and growth of the Ni or NiO nanopowders during the preparation process. The mean size of hollow core and shell thickness of the hollow NiO nanopowders are 11 and 7nm, respectively. At a current density of 0.5Ag−1, the NiO@SiO2 nanopowders with hollow and filled structures exhibit 100th cycle discharge capacities of 885 and 338mAhg−1, respectively.

Broadband anti-reflective properties of grown ZnO nanopyramidal structure on Si substrate via low-temperature electrochemical deposition,"Anti-reflection coatings (ARCs) are widely used in various optical and optoelectronic devices to minimize the reflection of light. In this study, we demonstrated the fabrication of ZnO nanopyramidal structures on Si substrate via low-temperature electrochemical deposition. We also investigated the anti-reflection (AR) properties of these nanostructures compared with nanorods and planar ZnO texture on Si substrates. We changed the growth conditions, namely, growth temperature and applied current density, to modify the shape of the ZnO nanorod tips. Nanopyramidal structures with continuously varying refractive index profiles in a single layer were obtained. Reflectance spectra show that the nanopyramid-based texture reduced the reflection of light in a broad spectral range from 380nm to 1000nm and is much more effective than nanorod and planar textures. For nanopyramid arrays (NPAs) with average tip diameter of 20nm, we achieved a 6.5% reflectance over a wide range of wavelengths, which is superior to an optimized single-layer ARC such as SiO2 or TiO2. These textured ZnO ARCs may be applied to a wide variety of photovoltaic devices and other anti-reflection applications with large areas because of their low temperature, fast growth, and simple fabrication.","Alimanesh, Mahmoud;Rouhi, Jalal;Hassan, Z.",2016-03-31,Ceramics International,"E.

Effect of process temperature on the microstructures and properties of enamels coated on Ti-bearing substrate RT360,"In this paper, we describe the experimental processing treatment of the enamel coating on Ti-bearing substrate RT360. The experiment simulates the process of manufacturing the enamel heat sink for use in a heat exchanger in nuclear power stations. The effect of processing temperature on the microstructures and properties of the enamel coating was investigated using a scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope and other methodologies. Our research determined that the density of Ti (C, N) particles in RT360 substrate was maximized, due to the interaction between the precipitate and solid solution, when processing treatment was at 850°C. At that temperature, the precipitate density optimized the hydrogen trapping sites, preventing the enamel coating from fish-scaling. Small Fe-rich islands were precipitated in the steel-enamel interface, forming anchor points due to Marangoni convection. Once the processing temperature exceeded 850°C, sufficient anchor points were created, resulting in a good adherence interface. However, when processing treatment temperature reached 900°C, excessive liquidity of the molten frit powders resulted in a nonuniform coating. We concluded that processing treatment of enamel-RT360 composite substrate at a temperature of 850°C was optimum for improved coating of the heat sink.","Tao, Junhui;Hu, Shubing;Kong, Junhua;Zhang, Yanwen",2017-06-01,Ceramics International,"RT360,Ti-bearing substrate,Processing temperature,Fish-scaling,Adherence,Uniformity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.02.032,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.02.032
Investigation of tribological properties of micro-arc oxidation ceramic coating on Mg alloy under dry sliding condition,"To enhance wear resistance of Mg alloy, micro-arc oxidation (MAO) ceramic coatings on Mg substrate were prepared in silicate electrolyte under various currents. It was found that the surface roughness and thickness of MAO coating were increased with the increase of current. The dry tribological tests showed that the friction coefficient and wear resistance of thicker coatings (obtained under currents of 3 A and 4 A) were much higher than that of Mg alloy and the thin coating (obtained under current of 2 A), meanwhile the lifetime of the coating obtained under 4 A was longer than the other coatings under higher load. The wear type of thin MAO coating was slight abrasive wear under low load, whereas translated to severe adhesive wear under high load. While the main wear mechanism of thick MAO coating was slight abrasive wear or scratch under the given test condition, which was attributed to the thick intermediate layer improved load support for the soft substrate. The tribological study indicated that the MAO coating obtained under 4 A current had better wear resistance and life time due to its compact microstructure and thickness.","Zhang, Dongya;Ge, Yanfeng;Liu, Guanlan;Gao, Feng;Li, Pengyang",2018-10-01,Ceramics International,"Mg alloy,Micro-arc oxidation,Ceramic coating,Tribological properties,Wear type",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.137,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.137
"Synthesis, microstructure and biodegradation behavior of nano-Si and nano-ZnO/Si coatings on a Mg/HA/TiO2/MgO nanocomposite","In this study, a successful synthesis of nano-Si single-layer and nano-ZnO/Si double-layer coatings on Mg/HA/TiO2/MgO nanocomposite using radio frequency magnetron sputtering was investigated by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The double-layered ZnO/Si nano-composite coating consisted of ZnO nanospheres with an average particle size of 28nm as the outer layer (~0.6-µm-thick, sputtering pressure of 0.16Pa) and the columnar microstructure of Si with an average particle size of 32nm in length and 21nm in width as the inner layer (~1.1-µm-thick, sputtering pressure of 0.24Pa). Microstructural analysis reveals little surface damage after ZnO/Si coatings initially and after 168h immersion in simulated body fluid, corrosion protective products including Mg(OH)2, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 and carbonate ions are formed on the uncoated and coated samples.

Before the joining process, the C/C composite surface was modified by solid state reaction with chromium to form a chromium carbide coating. This carbide reaction layer can react with the Ti-based brazing alloy and form evenly distributed TiC particles. The maximum apparent shear strength of as-received joint was 39±8.5 MPa obtained by using a 40μm thick Cu foil together with the TiCuZrNi alloy; this value was 70% higher than the mechanical strength obtained for joints brazed with the TiCuZrNi alloy only.","Song, Xinrui;Li, Hejun;Casalegno, Valentina;Salvo, Milena;Ferraris, Monica;Zeng, Xierong",2016-04-30,Ceramics International,"B.

Research on microstructure and oxidation resistant property of ZrSi2-SiC/SiC coating on HTR graphite spheres,"ZrSi2-SiC/SiC coating was prepared on the surface of high temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTR) matrix graphite spheres by two-step pack cementation and sintering process. The microstructure, oxidation resistance and thermal shock resistance properties of the as-prepared coatings with different original powder mixtures were investigated. Results show that dense microstructure of the ZrSi2-SiC/SiC coating and continuous ZrSiO4-SiO2-ZrO2 glass phase generated during the oxidation process were the key factors for the outstanding thermal properties. When the mole ratio of Zr:Si:C reaches 1:7:3 in the second pack cementation powders, the coated graphite spheres have optimum oxidation resistant ability. The weight gain is only 0.6wt% after 15 times thermal shock tests and 0.12wt% after isothermal oxidation test at 1500°C for 20h in air.

High supercapacitive stability of spray pyrolyzed ZnO-added manganese oxide coatings,"Zinc oxide (ZnO) has recently been reported to exhibit electrochemical supercapacitive properties. We demonstrate, for the first time, a nanocrystalline (<10nm) composite powder electrochemical supercapacitor in which ZnO-added manganese oxide is used as the active electrode material. The ZnO-added (≤10at%) manganese oxide powders were prepared from their acetate-based salts by spray pyrolysis (SP) at 500°C and subsequently coated onto graphite substrates by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) to produce supercapacitor electrodes. XRD data and TEM observation identified the ZnO-added manganese oxide as tetragonal Mn3O4 phase with a nanocrystalline structure. ZnO may dissolve in manganese oxide and inhibit the grain growth of the manganese oxide. Cyclic voltammetry showed that the specific capacitance (SC) of the manganese oxide coating in 1M Na2SO4 electrolyte increased from 196F/g to 230F/g at 25mV/s for 5at% ZnO-added manganese oxide.

High-temperature ferromagnetism of Ni-doped PbPdO2 nanograin films synthesized by sol-gel spin-coating method,"The single-phase Ni-doped PbPdO2 films with a body-centered orthorhombic structure were synthesized by the sol-gel spin-coating method and an oxidation treatment. The films with a thickness of about 440nm were found to have a nanograin structure and large amount of Pb vacancies. The valence states of Ni and Pd ions within the Ni-doped PbPdO2 films were very close to 2+, while the Pb ions exhibited a mixed valence between 2+ and 4+. The existence of Pb vacancies and the low electronegativity of Pb2+ ion resulted in the increase of the valence of Pb ions. The analysis of the magnetic properties indicated that the magnetisms of the single-phase Ni-doped PbPdO2 nanograin films were all composed of the ferromagnetism and the paramagnetism. The ferromagnetism enhanced with the calcination temperature increasing and could be retained up to 380K. A carrier-mediated mechanism bridged to the bound magnetic polaron model based on the Pb vacancies, the doped Ni ions and the Pb ions with a valence higher than 2+ were used to explain the magnetic origin of these Ni-doped PbPdO2 nanograin films.","Mei, C.;Liu, J.;Chuang, P.Y.;Song, T.T.;Tang, F.L.;Su, H.L.;Huang, J.C.A.;Wu, Y.C.",2017-02-01,Ceramics International,"Ni-doped PbPdO2,Nanograin film,High-temperature ferromagnetism,Pb vacancy",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.167,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.167

Effects of pre-strain applied at a polyethylene terephthalate substrate before the coating of Al-doped ZnO film on film quality and optical and electrical properties,"Five kinds of polyethylene-terephthalate (PET)/aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) specimen were prepared to examine the effect of strain applied to the PET substrate before the coating of AZO film on the mechanical, optical, and electrical properties and morphology. An increase in the strain of PET increases the reflection intensity, resulting in a significant reduction in absorption. The largest mean surface roughness was obtained for the PET-4%/AZO specimen. XRD diffraction peaks of ZnO (002) indicate that the quality of the AZO film initially improved with increasing strain, and then degraded with further increases. Compressive residual stresses formed in the bending specimens at various strains; the residual stress increased with decreasing 2θ angle. A higher compressive stress in the AZO film resulted in a lower optical band gap and a lower transmittance; it also led to an increase in the sheet resistance of the AZO film, and thus a lower carrier mobility.","Li, Tse-Chang;Hsieh, Po-Tsung;Lin, Jen-Fin",2011-09-30,Ceramics International,"B.

"Influence of annealing temperature on the structural and anti-corrosion characteristics of sol–gel derived, spin-coated thin films","Recently, an aqueous particulate sol–gel process using metallic chloride precursors was introduced to synthesize zirconium titanate. In this paper, the effect of annealing temperature on the structural and corrosion protection characteristics of spin-coated thin films obtained from this sol–gel system was investigated. Based on scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and spectroscopic reflectometry studies, it was found that the flatness and thickness of the thin films were decreased by increasing the annealing temperature. Also, the corrosion protection of stainless steel AISI 316L provided by the prepared coatings, as analyzed by electrochemical potentiodynamic polarization experiments in a simulated body fluid, was improved in this order: 500°C-annealed sample<900°C-annealed sample<700°C-annealed sample, attributed to a compromise between the defect density and the adhesion of the films to the substrate.","Salahinejad, E.;Hadianfard, M.J.;Vashaee, D.;Tayebi, L.",2014-03-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Physical properties of cerium doped-yttrium iron garnet ultrathin films for photovoltaic application,"In this study, cerium incorporated yttrium iron garnet ultrathin films (CexY3-xFe5O12) (where x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5) were prepared by the sol-gel method, spin coating technique, and heat treatment on quartz substrates. The effect of Ce on structural properties, morphology of thin films surface, and optical properties was explored by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission microscopy (FESEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). According to the XRD results, the films were crystalline with the cubic phase, while the FESEM indicated the YIG nanoparticles with approximately spherical shapes. The growth process of crystallite in YIG nanoparticles was investigated by X-ray peak broadening. The Williamson-Hall (W–H) analysis was utilized to maintain the contributions of crystallite size on the peak broadening of Ce:YIG nanoparticles. The structural features of thin films such as strain and stress for all of the peaks of XRD were accurately determined from the uniform deformation model (UDM) according to the YIG cubic phase. According to the AFM pictures, it seemed that thin films had a continuous and smooth surface. The absorption and transmission were measured in the visible and infrared region from 400 to 1200 nm.","Gharibshahi, Mohammad",2019-12-15,Ceramics International,"Cerium yttrium iron garnet thin films,Sol-gel,Structural features,Optical properties,Photovoltaic application",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.167,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.167
Oxidation kinetics of supersonic atmospheric plasma spraying ytterbium oxide doped molybdenum silicide coating,"Rare earth oxides usually play an active role in modifying the microstructure and oxidation resistance of silicide coatings, but its modification mechanism has not yet been clarified. In this work, molybdenum silicide (MoSi2) coating with different contents of ytterbium oxide (Yb2O3) was fabricated using supersonic atmospheric plasma spraying, and its microstructural evolution and oxidation behavior were investigated. Experimental results shown that the morphological characteristics of produced SiO2-rich glass scale varied with the doping of Yb2O3, which noticeably affected the oxidation resistance of sprayed MoSi2-Yb2O3 coatings. All coated specimens exhibited a parabolic oxidation behavior, wherein the MoSi2-10 wt%Yb2O3 coating possessed the smallest parabolic constant and the lowest specific mass loss with 100 h oxidation at 1500 °C due to the absence of SiC-depleted region and the formation of continuous multicomponent compound scale. Given this, Yb2O3 additive with proper concentration not only guaranteed the sufficient filling of open spaces in SiO2 network by Yb3+ cations, but also strengthened the Si–O bonds to increasing the viscosity of SiO2 glass, thereby delaying the effective delivery of reactive oxygen species inwardly.","Wang, Chang-Cong;Li, Ke-Zhi;He, Dan-Yang;Shi, Xiao-Hong",2020-04-01,Ceramics International,"Ytterbium oxide,Molybdenum silicide,Coating,Oxidation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.161,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.161
Synergistic effects of lanthanum and strontium to enhance the osteogenic activity of TiO2 nanotube biological interface,"According to the clinician's experience, the main reason for the inefficiency of osseointegration between biometal and surrounding bone tissue is still caused by the biological inertness on the surface. Due to the osteogenic effects of its titanium dioxide nanotubes (TiO2) and strontium ions, strontium-containing TiO2 nanotube (STN) coatings have been widely used for titanium surface modification. Trace amounts of rare earth elements (such as lanthanum (La)) show some potential in the performance of repairing bone tissue. In this study, in order to shorten the osseointegration time of titanium implants, we first introduced lanthanum into the biological interface of SrTiO3 nanotubes (LSTN) to achieve the best osteogenesis effect. The AFM, SEM, EDS, FTIR, XPS analyses revealed that the nanocomposite structure of the LSTN was successfully fabricated. LSTN exhibits excellent hydrophilicity and protein adsorption capacity, which are essential for the adhesion of pre-osteoblasts to the surface of nanotubes. LSTN did not show any cytotoxicity in pro-osteoblast proliferation and differentiation experiments. Just the opposite, the cells stretched well on the surface of the LSTN, showing a large number of stress fibers and actin filaments. Furthermore, compared with La-free nanotubes, LSTN showed the potential to excellently up-regulate the expression of osteoblast-related genes such as OCN, ALP, Col-1, and RUNX2. Our results show that LSTN exhibits excellent osteogenic potential due to the osteogenic effect of lanthanum and strontium and the protein adsorption capacity of nanotubes, which provides the possibility for accelerating bone healing in patients with bone damage.","Zhang, Xuejiao;Zhang, Xiaolei;Wang, Bingbing;Lan, Jinping;Yang, Hao;Wang, Zhenhui;Chang, Xiaotong;Wang, Saisai;Ma, Xinchao;Qiao, Haixia;Lin, He;Han, Shuguang;Huang, Yong",2020-06-15,Ceramics International,"Lanthanum,Polydopamine,Strontium,TiO2 nanotube,Osteogenic activity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.195,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.195
Evaluation of microwave processed glass–ceramic coating on nimonic superalloy substrate,"MgO–Al2O3–TiO2 based glass–ceramic coatings were formed on nimonic superalloy substrates by microwave and conventional heat treatment processes. The resultant glass–ceramic coatings were characterized by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), image analysis, nanohardness and Young's modulus evaluation by depth sensitive indentation (DSI) technique. Nanohardness and Young's modulus values of the microwave heat treated glass–ceramic coatings were improved in comparison to those of the conventionally treated glass–ceramic coatings due to presence of finer sized crystallites in the microwave processed coatings. Slight enhancement in the nanohardness and Young's modulus values with soaking time for the microwave processed coatings were explained in terms of the microstructural refinement and the reinforcement of the parent glass matrix.","Das, S.;Mukhopadhyay, A.K.;Datta, S.;Basu, D.",2010-04-30,Ceramics International,"A.

Development of a bone substitute material based on additive manufactured Ti6Al4V alloys modified with bioceramic calcium carbonate coating: Characterization and antimicrobial properties,"This investigation shows that composite structures based on additive manufactured electron beam melted Ti6Al4V scaffolds coated with calcium carbonate particles can be used as a potential biocomposites for bone substitutes. A continuous bioceramic coating of CaCO3 was deposited on additive manufactured titanium alloy under the influence of ultrasound. XRD analysis revealed the formation of a mixture of calcite and vaterite phases. CaCO3 coating led to decreasing roughness of additively manufactured (AM) scaffolds and improved surface hydrophilicity. In vitro assay demonstrated enhanced inorganic bone phase formation on the surface of CaCO3-coated AM scaffolds compared to as-manufactured ones. The short-term adhesion of S. aureus onto sample surface was evaluated by fluorescent microscopy 0, 3, and 72 h after cell seeding. It revealed that the surface modification resulted in the decreased number of bacteria attached to the surface after CaCO3 deposition. The morphology, roughness, solubility and superhydrophilic character of the CaCO3 coated EBM-manufactured Ti6Al4V alloy surface are suggested as factors contributing to preventing S. aureus adhesion. Thus, the developed biocomposites based on additively manufactured Ti6Al4V alloy scaffolds and CaCO3 coating can be successfully used in bone tissue regeneration providing the effective growth of inorganic bone phase and preventing the bacteria adhesion.","Surmeneva, Maria A.;Chudinova, Ekaterina A.;Chernozem, Roman V.;Lapanje, Ales;Koptyug, Andrey V.;Rijavec, Tomaž;Loza, Kateryna;Prymak, Oleg;Epple, Matthias;Wittmar, Alexandra;Ulbricht, Mathias;Surmenev, Roman A.",2020-11-30,Ceramics International,"Bioceramic coating,Electron beam melting,Calcium carbonate,Ultrasound,Simulated body fluid,Staphylococcus aureus",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.041,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.041
A processing route for dip-coating and characterization of multi-structured ceramic foam,"Ceramic foam materials have received great attention in recent years for their light weight, thermal/electrical insulation, high crack tolerance and good machinability properties. However, some applications demand higher mechanical strength, better resistivity of the surface against mechanical impact or improved abrasion resistance. In this paper, the feasibility of dip coating 89 vol% porous, green alumino-silicate foam bars with dimensions in the centimeter range was studied and a dip coating route was proposed. The surface morphology of uncoated and coated foam bars was first analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and later detailed using the GelsightTM method. Mechanical properties were determined by 4-point bending. A dense coating layer with a uniform thickness and good interfacial adhesion was obtained over the foam. Consequently, a three-fold increase in the flexural strength was measured for coated parts. In addition, the versatility of the developed dip coating route was demonstrated coating samples of bigger size like panels as well as complex geometries like cylindrical crucibles.","Vibhore Kumar Rastogi,;Jiang, Bo;Sturzenegger, Philip N.;Gonzenbach, Urs T.;Vetterli, Marc;Blugan, Gurdial;Kuebler, Jakob",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Porous ceramics,Dip coating,Coated foam,Surface roughness,GelsightTM method,Flexural strength",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.199,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.199
Effects of solution composition and electrophoretic deposition voltage on various properties of nanohydroxyapatite coatings on the Ti13Zr13Nb alloy,"The purpose of the research was to establish the influence of the solution composition and the electrophoretic deposition voltage on the coating homogeneity and thickness, nanohardness, adhesion, corrosion resistance and wettability. The Ti13Zr13Nb alloy was coated by the electrophoretic technique with hydroxyapatite in a solution containing 0.1, 0.2 or 0.5 g nanoHAp in 100 mL of suspension and at voltage 15, 30 or 50 V. The scanning electron and atomic force microscopies, polarization curves technique for corrosion assessment, nanoindentation and nanoscratch tests, and measurements of contact angle in simulated body fluid were performed. The obtained results revealed the complex and interrelated effects of both process determinants on the structure and properties of hydroxyapatite coatings, which were attributed to the role of the size, shape and content in suspension of hydroxyapatite particles.","Bartmanski, Michal;Zielinski, Andrzej;Majkowska-Marzec, Beata;Strugala, Gabriel",2018-11-30,Ceramics International,"Apatite D,Biomedical applications E,Films A,Mechanical properties C",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.148,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.148
Strain/sintering co-induced multiscale structural changes in plasma-sprayed thermal barrier coatings,"During thermal exposure, performance degradation is a main headache for thermal barrier coatings. However, most study to understand the performance evolution is often based on single effect of sintering with free-standing samples. Actually, the TBCs would be co-affected by sintering and strain caused by mismatch of thermal expansion coefficient (CTE). In this study, the multiscale structural changes of plasma-sprayed TBCs co-induced by strain and sintering were investigated. It is found that the overall evolution can be divided into several stages. At stage I, the single effect of strain leads to similar microscopic structural changes, despite of positive or negative CTE mismatch. This is highly related to the feature of lamellar structure. At stage II, the co-effect of sintering and strain on microscopic structural change is associated with the strain signs. Different strain signs lead to opposite changing trends in morphology of inter-splat pores, which affects their healing rates through multi-contact. As a result, the positive strain would enhance the sintering kinetic, whereas the negative strain would retard the sintering kinetic. At stage-III, the co-effect of sintering and strain leads to macroscopic structural changes, which can be responsible for different failure mechanisms. The new insight into co-effect of sintering and strain provides a comprehensive understanding on the performance evolution of plasma-sprayed TBCs, which is crucial for the further structural tailoring to retard the performance degradation.","Li, Guang-Rong;Yang, Guan-Jun;Chen, Xue-Feng;Li, Cheng-Xin;Li, Chang-Jiu",2018-08-15,Ceramics International,"Multiscale structural changes,Co-effect of strain and sintering,Thermal barrier coatings,Structural tailoring,Performance degradation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.051,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.051
Advanced solid-state 1H/31P NMR characterization of pyrophosphate-doped calcium phosphate cements for biomedical applications: The structural role of pyrophosphate,"From a suite of advanced magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) experiments, we present a comprehensive structural analysis of pyrophosphate-bearing calcium phosphate cements that are investigated for bone-inductive biomedical implants. The cements consist mainly of poorly ordered monetite (CaHPO4), along with minor Ca orthophosphate phases, and two distinct pyrophosphate constituents: crystalline β-Ca2P2O7 and amorphous calcium pyrophosphate (ACPP), the latter involving one water-bearing portion and another anhydrous component. Independent 2D MAS NMR experiments evidenced close contacts between the amorphous pyrophosphates and the monetite phase, where ACPP is proposed to form a thin layer coating the monetite particles. Heteronuclear 1H–31P and homonuclear 31P–31P correlation NMR experimentation enabled us to detect, identify, and quantify even minor cement constituents ( ≲ 2 mol%) that could not be ascertained by the Rietveld method. Quantitative phase analyses of the cements, as determined independently by 31P NMR and PXRD, are contrasted and discussed.","Yu, Yang;Guo, Hua;Pujari-Palmer, Michael;Stevensson, Baltzar;Grins, Jekabs;Engqvist, Håkan;Edén, Mattias",2019-11-30,Ceramics International,"Bioceramics,Monetite cement,DCPA,Amorphous calcium pyrophosphate,31P NMR,1H NMR,2D homonuclear/heteronuclear correlation NMR spectroscopy,Rietveld refinement,Cement structure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.047,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.047
Temperature-induced strain mediated magnetization changes in NiFe2O4/BaTiO3 heterostructure,"Herein, we report the temperature-induced magnetization changes of NiFe2O4 thin film, which is coated over a ferroelectric BaTiO3 ceramic substrate. The solid-state reaction method was adopted for the preparation of ferroelectric BaTiO3 (BT) substrate, whereas NiFe2O4 (NFO) film was deposited by spin-coating method. Rietveld refinement revealed that BT substrate has a tetragonal (P4mm) crystal system along with a minor orthorhombic phase (Amm2) at room temperature. The GIXRD analysis confirms the phase purity of NFO/BT heterostructure. Polarization hysteresis with respect to electric field (P-E loop) and the temperature-dependent dielectric measurement of BT substrate demonstrate its typical ferroelectric and phase transition behavior, respectively. Magnetization hysteresis loops were recorded for the NFO/BT heterostructure at 150, 240 and 300 K. A significant increase in the remnant magnetization (MR) and coercive field (HC) of NFO film are noticed while cooling the heterostructure below 300 K. Variation in the magnetization of NFO film corresponds to the change in the structural phase transition (Amm2 at 240 K and R3c at 150 K) of BT while cooling below RT. The interfacial strain mediated coupling is the primary mechanism attributed to the temperature-induced changes in the magnetization of NFO/BT heterostructure.","B., Bagyalakshmi;M., Veera Gajendra Babu;N., Lakshminarasimhan;B., Sundarakannan",2018-09-30,Ceramics International,"NiFe2O4/BaTiO3 Heterostructure,Magnetization,Ferroelectric,Rietveld refinement",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.144,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.144
Humidity sensor based on Ga2O3 nanorods doped with Na+ and K+ from GaN powder,"Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) nanorods were prepared from commercial gallium nitride (GaN) powder via the simple thermal annealing method by one step, and they were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The thick film humidity sensors were prepared by spin-coating the sensing materials on Al2O3 ceramic substrates coated with Ag–Pd interdigitated electrodes and the humidity sensing properties were studied in detail. The as-prepared Ga2O3 nanorods are of diameters 40–100nm and lengths 1–6μm, and they are doped with Na+ and K+, successfully. The impedance variation of Ga2O3 nanorods sensor with the humility exhibits good linearity response about four orders of magnitude, when the relative humility (RH) is changed from 11% to 95% at 100Hz. Response and recovery times are about 6s and 21s and the maximum hysteresis is only 3% RH at 100Hz. The good humility sensing properties may be attributed to the synergistic effect of Ga2O3 nanorods and the ions doping.","Wang, Ding;Lou, Yanlong;Wang, Run;Wang, Pengpeng;Zheng, Xuejun;Zhang, Yong;Jiang, Nan",2015-12-31,Ceramics International,"Ga2O3 nanorods,Humidity sensors,Doping of ions,GaN powder",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.07.211,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.07.211
Mechanical properties and thermal shock in thin ZrO2–Y2O3–Al2O3 films obtained by the sol-gel method,"Thin multilayer coatings of ZrO2–Y2O3–Al2O3 were prepared using the sol-gel method and dip-coating technique in order to advance in the study of what influence the incorporation of Al2O3 has on films of Y2O3-doped ZrO2, investigating its role in the synthesis of the solutions and in the characteristics and properties of the coatings. After the characterization of the solutions used in the process, the microstructure of the films was studied and their mechanical behaviour and resistance to thermal shock were determined so as to optimize the characteristics and functionality of these coatings. With increased alumina content, 3YSZ-Al2O3 (20 mol%), the cubic phase of the zirconia disappeared completely at the sintering temperature used (700 °C), resulting in the tetragonal phase with Al in solution. There was also a decrease in the coatings' hardness and Young's modulus, and an increase in toughness and resistance to thermal shock. These results allow guidelines to be established for the design of multilayer structures that are, tougher, more resistant, and have improved surface properties.","Díaz-Parralejo, Antonio;Díaz-Díez, M.

Preparation of nickel coating on ZTA particles by electroless plating,"With the aim to effectively improve the interface between ZrO2 toughened Al2O3 (ZTA) particles and metal matrix, nickel was deposited on the surface of ZTA particles by electroless plating method. Formation mechanism of nickel coating and effects of the solution pH, loading capacity of ZTA particles and temperature on the nickel deposition were investigated. Microstructures, thickness and element distributions of nickel coating were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The results showed that the nickel was successfully deposited on the surface of ZTA particles by electroless plating without noticeable defects. The process of electroless nickel plating could be explained by combination of atomic hydrogen and electrochemistry theories. The interfacial nucleation of nickel is easier to form than spontaneous nucleation in the solution. Deposited Nickel has priority on the surface of ZTA particles comparing to that in solution. The optimal conditions to coat nickel on the surface of ZTA particles are: solution pH 4.7–4.8, loading capacity 15–20 g/L, and electroless plating temperature 85 °C. The ZTA particle reinforced iron matrix composites prepared by powder metallurgy could have better interfacial bonding between ZTA particle and iron matrix because of the nickel coating on the surface of ZTA particle. Nickel diffuses into the iron matrix during the sintering preparation of composite materials. The interface between ZTA particle and iron matrix presents the evidence of non-chemical bonding.","Fan, Lei;Wang, Qiang;Yang, Peng;Chen, Huahui;Hong, Haiping;Zhang, Wanting;Ren, Jie",2018-07-31,Ceramics International,"ZrO2 toughened Al2O3 (ZTA),Electroless plating,Nickel,Interface,Composites",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.055,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.055
Insight into the evolution mechanism of carbon film and Eu valence in carbon coated BaMgAl10O17: Eu2+ phosphor annealed in air,"Performing carbon coating on the surface of phosphors has been proven to be an effective strategy to enhance the oxidation resistance, which is an important factor to achieve stable luminescent devices. Therefore, a good understanding of the protection mechanism favors a continuous improvement of oxidation resistance of phosphors. In present paper, the evolution of the carbon layer, Eu valence (Eu2+/Eu3+), and luminescent properties for the C coated BaMgAl10O17: Eu2+ phosphor when annealed at high temperature is investigated carefully. Decrease of carbon layer promotes the appearance color transition from black to white as the annealing temperature rises to 1000 °C in air. As expected, the decrease of carbon layer will enhance the luminescence intensity, but risk the possible oxidation of Eu2+ to Eu3+, which inhibits the blue emission ascribed to Eu2+. The results indicate that luminescence intensity of phosphor is dependent on the synergistic effect of carbon thickness and Eu2+/Eu3+ ratio. Additionally, a reduction reaction of Eu3+ to Eu2+ is observed in C coated BaMgAl10O17: Eu2+ phosphor when annealed at high temperature, which also contributes to the higher luminescence intensity.","Yin, Liang-Jun;Xie, Wen-Jie;Wang, Meng;Tian, Wei;Zhang, Sheng-Hui;Liang, Ying-Lin;Lee, Ming-Hsien;Liu, Ming-zhen;Jian, Xian;Deng, Long-Jiang",2018-06-01,Ceramics International,"Coating,Oxidation resistance,BAM phosphor,Reduction,Luminescence",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.080,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.080
Superior high-temperature oxidation resistance of magnetron sputtered Hf–B–Si–C–N film,"A hard and optically transparent amorphous Hf7B23Si17C4N45 film with a contamination level less than 4at%, prepared by reactive pulsed dc magnetron sputtering, was subjected to systematic investigation of high-temperature oxidation behavior in air up to 1700°C. We focus on thermogravimetric analysis of the film in air and on the evolution of the film structure, microstructure and elemental composition with an annealing temperature ranging from 1100°C to 1700°C. The film exhibits a superior oxidation resistance up to 1600°C due to a formation of a nanocomposite protective oxide layer on the surface above 1000°C. The layer consists of monoclinic and tetragonal (or orthorhombic) HfO2 nanocrystallites surrounded by a SiO2-based amorphous matrix, most probably containing boron. The HfO2 nanocrystallites exhibit a gradient in size with a dense population of small (a couple of nm) crystallites next to the interface and larger but dispersed crystallites close to the surface.","Zeman, P.;Zuzjaková, Š.;Mareš, P.;Čerstvý, R.;Zhang, M.;Jiang, J.;Meletis, E.I.;Vlček, J.",2016-03-31,Ceramics International,"Hf–B–Si–C–N,High-temperature material,Superior oxidation resistance,Nanocomposite oxide layer,Protective coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.11.171,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.11.171
Influential parameters and performance of a glass-ceramic sealant for solid oxide fuel cells,"Glass-ceramic composites are among the few materials suitable for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) sealing application due to their high operating temperatures (600–850°C). Glass-ceramics can chemically bond to both the metallic interconnector and the ceramic electrolyte and provide a gas-tight connection. However, a careful manufacturing procedure, which includes several stages, is required to obtain a gas-tight seal. In this study, the joint strength of the glass-ceramic sealant between two metallic interconnectors is experimentally investigated for different surface properties of the metallic interconnector. According to the experimental results, the optimum sintering temperature and pressure are found to be 870°C and 0.5kgcm−2, respectively.

Corrosion resistance and cytocompatibility studies of zinc-doped fluorohydroxyapatite nanocomposite coatings on titanium implant,"In this study, zinc-doped fluoridated hydroxyapatite (ZnFHA) nano-composite coatings were deposited on the surface of commercially pure titanium (Ti-cp) via electrolytic deposition technique. The phase composition, crystallite size, microstructure, and elemental composition of coated specimens were characterized using different techniques including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis respectively. The influence of coatings on the corrosion behaviour of the specimens was determined by potentiodynamic polarisation in simulated body fluid. In vitro biocompatibility tests, MTT and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were also employed to assess the cytocompatibility of ZnFHA coating with osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. Results demonstrated that zinc and fluoride were successfully incorporated into apatite lattice structure. Co-doping of Zn2+ and F− ions decreased hydroxyapatite unit cell volume and grain sizes. Obtained coatings were totally crack-free and dense, which led to decrease in corrosion current densities of Ti-cp in physiological solutions. In addition, cytocompatibility tests demonstrated a good osteoblast proliferation and spreading on ZnFHA. More importantly, results showed that the Zn/F-doping can promote ALP expression, which is a probable effect of a combination of nanostructured surface effects and ion release (Zn2+ and F−). Overall, the ZnFHA coated Ti-cp possesses favourable corrosion resistance and cytocompatibility for the application as biomedical implant material.","Huang, Yong;Zhang, Xuejiao;Qiao, Haixia;Hao, Min;Zhang, Honglei;Xu, Zhiwei;Zhang, Xiaoyun;Pang, Xiaofeng;Lin, He",2016-01-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Strontium and copper co-substituted hydroxyapatite-based coatings with improved antibacterial activity and cytocompatibility fabricated by electrodeposition,"Bacterial infection are serious complications for biomedical implants in the orthopedic and dental fields, and the ideal implants should combine good antibacterial ability and bioactivity. In this paper, we have fabricated the strontium/copper substituted hydroxyapatite (SrCuHA) coating on the commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti) and studied their effect on antibacterial and in vitro cytocompatible properties. Cu was incorporated into HA in order to improve its antimicrobial properties. Sr was added as a second binary element to improve the biocompatibility. The structural and morphological characteristics of the SrCuHA coatings were investigated using various analytical techniques. The presence of Sr2+ and Cu2+ in solution led to reduced roughness of the coating and finer nucleus size formed. The results highlight that Sr2+ and Cu2+ were homogenously incorporated into HA lattice to form SrCuHA coatings. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used for the leach out analysis of the samples. A low contact angle value revealed the hydrophilic nature. In vitro electrochemical corrosion studies indicated that the SrCuHA coating sustain in the stimulated body-fluid (SBF), exhibiting superior corrosion resistance with a lower corrosion penetration rate than the bare CP-Ti substrate. The SrCuHA coatings can kill Escherichia coli to a certain extent during the first few days, which might be due to the Cu substitution in the coating. An enhancement of in vitro osteoblast adhesion, proliferation, and alkaline phosphatase activity was observed, which could lead to the optimistic orthopedic and dental applications.","Huang, Yong;Hao, Min;Nian, Xiaofeng;Qiao, Haixia;Zhang, Xuejiao;Zhang, Xiaoyun;Song, Guiqin;Guo, Jiachi;Pang, Xiaofeng;Zhang, Honglei",2016-08-01,Ceramics International,"Films,Corrosion,Apatite,Biomedical applications",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.110,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.110
"Size dependent structural, anti-bacterial and anti-biofilm properties of Er doped Li-Ni ferrites synthesized by the sol-gel auto-combustion route","The pure phased nanocrystalline Li0.25Ni0.5ErxFe2.25−xO4 (x=0.00, 0.04) ferrites were synthesized by the sol-gel auto combustion route and subsequently annealed at different temperatures. Thermal behavior of as-prepared materials was examined by the thermogravimetric and differential thermal analyzer (TG/DTA). The crystal structure, grain size and morphology were determined by using X-ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The effects of the Er substitution as well as annealing temperatures on the structure, particle size and antibacterial properties were investigated. The antibacterial studies were carried out using both gram negative (Campylobacter jejuni, Enteropathogenic E. coli, Vibrio cholerae) and gram positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus). The anti-biofilm activity of the doped nanocrystals was also evaluated. Doping of Er ions in Li-Ni ferrites enhanced antibacterial activity against the all tested bacteria. However, a marked decrease in the antibacterial activity of the doped nanocrystals was observed with the increase in the annealing temperature and the grain size. The significant reduction (P≤0.01) in the biofilm forming trends of all tested pathogens was noted when treated (doped nanocrystals) and untreated controls were compared. Campylobacter jejuni and Vibrio cholerae were found to be most susceptible to both the anti-bacterial (P≤0.01) and the anti-biofilm (P≤0.005) activities of the Li0.25Ni0.5Er0.04Fe2.21O4. The results indicated that Er doped Li-Ni nanoferrites can be used as a coating material to prevent the bacterial growth and the biofilm formation.","Noreen, Zobia;Ahmad, Imran;Siddiqui, Fairha;Ziya, A.B.;Abbas, Tahir;Bokhari, Habib",2017-10-01,Ceramics International,"Ferrites,Sol-gel,X-ray diffraction, antibacterial, anti-biofilm",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.092,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.092
Molten salt synthesis of continuous tungsten carbide coatings on graphite flakes,"Continuous tungsten carbide (WC) coatings were prepared on graphite flakes (Gf) by molten salt synthesis (MSS) technique using NaCl and KCl as reaction medium. The effect of reaction temperature, dwelling times and WO3/Gf molar ratio on the compositions and morphologies of resultant samples was investigated, and the related formation mechanism for the coatings was also discussed. The results show that continuous WC coatings can be prepared at 1100°C for 60min with a WO3/Gf molar ratio ranging from 1/15 to 1/5. These coatings exhibit homogeneous and crack free features, and their thickness increases with the increase of molar ratio. With the WO3/Gf molar ratio below or beyond the above range, discontinuous WC coatings or W/W2C/WC flake-like particles without graphite are obtained, respectively. The varied compositions of the samples obtained with different WO3/Gf molar ratio can be related to the detailed chemical reaction process between WO3 and Gf in the molten salts. A “template-growth” mechanism is proposed to explain the formation of WC coatings in the MSS process.","Zhang, Kuo;Shi, Zhongqi;Zhang, Xiaoyu;Zhang, Zhejian;Ge, Bangzhi;Xia, Hongyan;Guo, Yajie;Qiao, Guanjun",2017-08-01,Ceramics International,"Graphite flakes,WC coating,Molten salt synthesis,Mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.131,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.131
"Effect of deposition temperature on the mechanical, corrosive and tribological properties of mullite coatings","Thermal-sprayed ceramic coatings are used worldwide to provide protection from corrosion and wear on components. Nevertheless, they exhibit very poor tribological performance in corrosive conditions, primarily because the high porosity and low cohesive strength, resulting in severe corrosion of metal materials and wear of coatings. Herein, a series of mullite coatings are deposited on the surface of titanium alloys under different deposition temperatures and the splats behavior, mechanical properties, corrosion and wear performance of mullite coatings are studied. Results show that adjusting the deposition temperature can modify the splats behaviors, improve the microstructure and degree of crystallinity and enhance the hardness and cohesive strength. Owing to the improvements, the specimens deposited at higher temperatures have the excellent anti-corrosion and wear-resistant ability.","Li, Shuangjian;Zhao, Xiaoqin;An, Yulong;Deng, Wen;Hou, Guoliang;Hao, Enkang;Zhou, Huidi;Chen, Jianmin",2018-04-15,Ceramics International,"Plasma spraying,Mechanical properties,Corrosion and wear resistance,Mullite",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.087,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.087
Effect of niobium doping on opto-electronic properties of sol–gel based nanostructured indium tin oxide thin films,"Optically transparent conducting niobium-doped indium tin oxide (ITNO) thin films were deposited on soda lime glass via sol–gel spin coating technique under various Nb-doping contents. The effect of different Nb-dopant contents on the opto-electronic as well as microstructural properties of the films were characterized by means of UV–vis spectroscopy, four point probe, X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). For this purpose, addition of different Nb contents with tin at fixed 6at% is considered as the first approach. For the second and third approaches, different Nb-doping contents were added at fixed atomic ratios of In:Sn=94:6 and In:Sn=95:5, respectively. Optimum opto-electronic properties, including minimum resistivity of 37.2×10−3 Ωcm with average transmittance of about 85% in the visible region and band gap of 3.48eV was achieved for ITNO thin films prepared by the first approach at Nb and Sn doping content of 1 and 5at%, respectively. XRD analysis revealed patterns of cubic bixbyite structure of In2O3 and rhombohedral structure of ITO for Nb-doped films with small shift in major peak position to lower diffraction angles with the addition of Nb. FESEM micrographs show that addition of Nb causes clustering of the grains at higher doping content. However, AFM studies show that addition of Nb dopant leads to the formation of films with compact surface and less average roughness compare to the undoped ITO films.","Mohammadi, Saeed;Abdizadeh, Hossein;Golobostanfard, Mohammad Reza",2013-05-31,Ceramics International,"Indium tin oxide,Nb doping,Sol–gel spin coating,Opto-electronic properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.11.027,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.11.027
Strongly enhanced ferroelectric performance in Ca-doped barium titanate coatings produced by plasma electrolytic oxidation,"In this study, Ca-doped BaTiO3 coatings were directly produced on a Ti substrate by a plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) process. Aqueous mixtures of 0.2 M Ba(OH)2 and different amount of CaO were used as electrolytes in the PEO process. The as-synthesized coatings were carefully characterized by different techniques and their ferroelectric performances were investigated. It is found that small amount of Ca doping is beneficial for the improvement of coatings' ferroelectric properties. The ferroelectric performance of the optimized Ca-doping coating is 350 times that of the undoped coating. However, excess Ca doping is harmful for the ferroelectric performances, which is due to the decreased amount of tetragonal phase and the formation of high-Ca compound. This study indicates that the ferroelectric properties of BaTiO3 coatings can be greatly improved by optimizing the doping amount of Ca. In addition, this study provides new insights of improving ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of coating materials by chemical doping through the PEO technology.","Chen, Xi;Wang, Linlin;Jia, Yanmin;Li, Yuliang;Li, Xiping;Dong, Weiping;Wang, Bin;Wang, Xiaoming",2019-07-31,Ceramics International,"Plasma electrolytic oxidation,Coatings,Ferroelectric performance,Barium titanate,Ca-doping",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.233,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.233
"In-situ (Ti,Nb)C reinforced Ni-based coatings: New insights into microstructure evolution, enhanced phase configuration behavior and tribological properties","Multiple carbide reinforced metal matrix composite coating has been a promising material with superior abrasion resistance properties. Currently the improvement of the wear resistance of metal matrix composite coating mainly depends on the introduction of reinforcing phase at the expense of the inherent excellent ductility of metal matrix. Here, a new window to enhancing the wear resistance by adjusting the configuration of reinforcing phase space without sacrificing the inherent toughness of the matrix is introduced. Multiple (Ti,Nb)C/Ni-based hardfacing alloy coating prepared by plasma transferred arc technology has been investigated in this paper. Results showed that with the change of Ti/Nb atoms ratio, Cr-rich carbide has an obvious refinement behavior, which changes from a thick slat shape to a short bar with a smaller length-diameter ratio. It is observed that the microcracks are generated from coarse Cr-rich carbide under the action of applied stress and expand rapidly. Nevertheless, with the refinement evolution of Cr-rich carbide shape, only tiny micro-cracks exist in Cr-rich carbide. When Ti:Nb = 7:3, the improvement of wear resistance of the coating was mainly attributed to the reasonable spatial configuration distribution of the enhanced phase. When Ti:Nb = 3:7 and 0:10, the improvement of wear resistance of coating was mainly attributed to the improvement of microhardness brought by the increase of carbide precipitation content. By designing the internal correlation between the spatial configuration behavior of reinforcing phase and dry sliding wear test, the positive correlation between wear resistance and microhardness of materials was broken, which may provide a design window for improving wear resistance while maintaining good toughness of matrix.","Zhang, Mingyang;Li, Min;Chi, Jing;Wang, Shufeng;Fang, Min;Zhou, Chao;Liang, Bin;Xue, Junxian",2020-06-15,Ceramics International,"Ceramic-metal composite coating,(Ti,Nb)C,Microstructure evolution,Space configuration,Tribological properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.223,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.223
La2O3-coated Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 as cathode materials with enhanced specific capacity and cycling stability for lithium-ion batteries,"Li-rich layered oxides are the most promising cathode candidate for new generation rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. In this work, La2O3-coated Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 cathode materials were fabricated via a combined method of sol-gel and wet chemical processes. The structural and morphological characterizations of the materials demonstrate that a thin layer of La2O3 is uniformly covered on the surface of Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 particles, and the coating of La2O3 has no obvious effect on the crystal structure of Li-rich oxide. The electrochemical performance of La2O3-coated Li-rich cathodes including specific capacity, cycling stability and rate capability has been significantly improved with the coating of La2O3. The Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 coated with 2.5wt% La2O3 exhibits the highest discharge capacity, improved cycling stability and reduced charge transfer resistance, delivering a large discharge capacity of 276.9mAhg−1 in the 1st cycle and a high capacity retention of 71% (201.4mAhg−1) after 100 cycles. The optimal rate capability of the materials is observed at the coating level of 1.5wt% La2O3 such that the material exhibits the highest discharge capacity of 90.2mAhg−1 at 5C. The surface coating of La2O3 can effectively facilitate Li+ interfacial diffusion, reduce the structural change and secondary reactions between cathode materials and electrolyte during the charge-discharge process, and thus induce the great enhancement in the electrochemical properties of the Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 materials.","Zhou, Lin;Tian, Mijie;Deng, Yunlong;Zheng, Qiaoji;Xu, Chenggang;Lin, Dunmin",2016-11-01,Ceramics International,"Lithium-ion batteries,Li-rich layered oxide,La2O3 coating layer,Electrochemical performance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.016
Corrosive wear behavior of chromium carbide coatings deposited by air plasma spraying,"The corrosive wear behavior of chromium carbide coatings deposited by air plasma spraying was studied, through wet pin-on-disk wear experiments. During the wear tests, the samples were immersed in corrosive environments consisting of watery hydrochloric acid with the acid concentrations of 5, 10 and 15vol%. The wear tests were performed at both room temperature and 80°C. The results showed that the wet environment significantly increased the wear rate. In addition, the increase of the acid concentration and temperature considerably deteriorated the wear resistance of the coated samples. It was also realized that, compared to the dry condition, the wear mechanism changed from abrasive to adhesive in the wet environment where a tribochemical wear was observed.","Yaghtin, A.H.;Salahinejad, E.;Khosravifard, A.;Araghi, A.;Akhbarizadeh, A.",2015-07-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Wollastonite-containing bioceramic coatings on alumina substrates: Design considerations and mechanical modelling,In this work we produced wollastonite-containing glass-ceramic coatings on alumina substrates by airbrush spraying of glass-based aqueous suspensions followed by sintering. Investigations by scanning electron microscopy revealed that layer-wise slurry deposition is a suitable technique to manufacture homogeneous and continuous bioceramic coatings without flaws or cracks at the coating/substrate interface. Coating thickness can be designed by controlling the number of spraying cycles. The bonding strength of the coating (about 22MPa) was found adequate for biomedical applications. A mechanical model based on the innovative concepts of quantized fracture mechanics was developed to predict the bonding strength and estimate the fracture toughness of the coating on the basis of experimental data from tensile tests.

Fabrication of a metal oxide layer on a multi-walled carbon nanotube surface by in-flight coating using gas-phase deposition,"Understanding the mechanism of the formation of a coating layer on the surface of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) is a critical issue in coating technology applications. By understanding this mechanism, the structure of the coating layer can be easily controlled. In the present study, the objective is to investigate the effect of alkoxy groups on the formation of a coating layer on MWCNT surfaces. Six types of alkoxy groups based on the metal precursors were used. Metal oxide layers of SiO x , TiO x , and AlO x coated on MWCNTs have been investigated by in-flight coating, i.e., by using a combination of aerosolization of MWCNTs and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. Electron microscopy images showed that titanium oxide tended to form nanoparticulates in the case of long alkoxy precursors, while silica oxide formed a smoother surface. A longer alkoxy group would generate a rougher film morphology than a short alkoxy group. Furthermore, the entire MWCNT surfaces were successfully coated by the silica-based oxide precursors. The particles adhered to the surface in the case of the aluminum-based precursor. The morphologies of the layer structures were significantly influenced by the length of the alkoxy groups and the metal precursors. The difference in the coating structures was ascribed to the different dissociation rates among them after bombardment by plasma fields.","Kubo, Masaru;Kusdianto, K.;Masuda, Hidetaka;Shimada, Manabu",2016-05-15,Ceramics International,"Thin film,Alkoxy group,Dissociation,Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition,Aerosolization",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.03.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.03.008
"In-situ fabrication of novel (Ti, Cr)-N/aluminide multilayer coatings by plasma nitriding Ti-Cr coated Al alloy","In this research, a two-step treatment via depositing Ti-Cr film followed by plasma nitriding was adopted to enhance the surface mechanical properties of 2024 Al alloys. The Al alloys coated with different Ti-Cr films (Cr content, 10%, 25% and 40%) were plasma nitrided at 460 °C for 8 h, in a gas mixture of 40% N2+60% H2. Results showed that the surface coatings consisted of the outer nitride layer including (Ti,Cr)N or (Ti, Cr)N0.3 and the inner Al-Ti-Cr based aluminide layer. With increasing the Cr content, high N content phase (Ti,Cr)N increased in the nitride layer and the thickness of the aluminide layer also increased. The surface hardness of nitrided samples were enhanced by increasing the Cr content, reaching the maximum value of ~1040 HV for the nitride sample with 40 at% Cr. The coefficients of friction for samples with different nitride coatings showed little difference at the stable wear process, with the value of ~0.40. The nitrided samples undergo severe adhesive wear at the initial stage and abrasive wear at the stable stage, accompanied with oxidation wear.","Zhang, Fanyong;Yan, Shu;Yan, Mufu;He, Jining;Yin, Fuxing",2018-04-15,Ceramics International,"In-situ fabrication,Plasma nitriding,TiCrN,Aluminide,Wear resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.182,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.182

Improvement in the mechanical properties of plasma spray ceramic-Cu/TI3AlC2 gradient coatings by heat treatment,"Interface durability of thermal spraying ceramics and metal bond-coats is crucial for their service life. However, most of the studies have focused on improving the interfacial durability of a single metal/alloy bond-coat. In this study, a ceramic-Cu/Ti3AlC2 composite coating was successfully prepared by atmospheric plasma spraying, and its microstructural evolution during the heat treatment and the changes in its mechanical properties from the substrate to the top-coats were investigated systematically. The heat-treated bond-coats showed a gradient interpenetrating structure with a large number of nanoparticles and reticulated Cu. In bond-coats, the ceramic layer connected to the top-coats, and the Cu mesh connected to the substrate. Through gradient interpenetrating structure of bond-coats, the substrate and top-coats was nailed together. Hardness and Young's modulus gradients of the interpenetrating-structured coating were observed from the top-coat to the substrates. This improved the interface durability between the top-coats and the bond-coats.

The coatings adhered well to the steel substrates. It was determined by salt spray tests that the coatings enhance corrosion resistance. The aim of hydrophobic fluorosilane modification of hBN nanoparticles was to enrich hBN quantity on the top surface of the coatings.

Frictional and wear performance of TiAlN/TiN coated tool against high-strength steel,"The sliding friction and high-speed turning experiments were carried out in dry conditions to reveal the anti-friction characteristics and wear mechanisms of the TiAlN/TiN coated tool against high-strength steel. The friction coefficient was collected and wear rate was calculated in the sliding tests, while the value of flank wear width was measured in the turning tests. The microstructure and composition of the worn surfaces were observed by an ESEM and an EDX, respectively. During the sliding wear process, the friction coefficient showed an upward trend with the increase of applied load, while it showed a downward trend with the increase of sliding speed. With the changes of the sliding speed and applied load, the wear volume and wear rate of the coating showed the opposite trend. The combined action of the peeling off, chipping, adhesion, mechanical scratch, element diffusion and oxidation was the dominate wear mechanisms of the TiAlN/TiN coated tool in sliding and turning process. Furthermore, the build-up layer and oxide films formed on the worn surface can prevent the direct contact of the friction pair, which played a positive role in lubrication and anti-friction.","Zheng, Guangming;Zhao, Guoyong;Cheng, Xiang;Xu, Rufeng;Zhao, Jun;Zhang, Huaqiang",2018-04-15,Ceramics International,"B.

Effects of micro-grooves on tribological behaviour of plasma-sprayed alumina-13%titania coatings,This study was aimed at investigating the effects of micro-grooves on the tribological behaviour of a plasma-sprayed Al2O3 – 13%TiO2 coating. A combined surface profile with non-regular depths and micro-groove texture was successfully developed by using a Nd:YVO4 laser system. The surface condition and characterisation of the Al2O3 – 13%TiO2 coating was conducted using a VPSEM and a 3D microscope. A pin-on-disc test was then carried out to measure the effectiveness of the micro-grooves in reducing the wear rates of the Al2O3 – 13%TiO2 coatings under non-lubricated conditions. It was noted that the textured coatings gradually decreased the wear rate with only a slight reduction on the friction coefficient due to the entrapment of the wear debris within the grooves. It was proven that the combined surfaces successfully reduced the wear rate up to 44.7% and 61.5% for 10N and 20N of load respectively.,"Wahab, J.A.;Ghazali, M.J.;Sajuri, Z.;Otsuka, Y.;Jayaprakash, M.;Nakamura, S.;Baharin, A.F.S.",2017-06-01,Ceramics International,"Surface texturing,Plasma sprayed Al2O3 – 13%TiO2,Micro-groove,Wear",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.02.052,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.02.052
Ultraviolet antireflectance and high energy facets induced superhydrophilicity in SnO2 nano-arrayed thin films,"Ultraviolet (UV) radiation carries higher energy than visible light which causes potential damages to eye, immune system and skin. Even though antireflective glasses available in market are effective against visible light, they reflect high levels of UV radiation. Hence development of coatings which neither transmit nor reflect high energy UV radiation is highly desirable. Herein, we demonstrate the direct growth of SnO2 nanostructured arrays with broadband antireflectance using a simple spray pyrolysis method. An investigation on nanostructure evolution has been carried out which revealed that the growth mechanism has a strong dependence on deposition temperature, time and solvent used. SnO2 nanostructured arrays exhibited broadband antireflectance with less than 0.5% reflectance and near zero transmittance in high energy UVB (280–315 nm) wavelength region due to the graded refractive index and scattering provided by nanoarrays. The prepared samples are superhydrophilic in nature due to the presence of high energy facets which account for their observed anticondensation properties. These multifunctional SnO2 nanostructured arrays may have potential applications in sunglasses, safety glasses, windows, optical materials and solar panels owing to their antireflective, antifogging and self-cleaning properties.","Paloly, Abdul Rasheed;Satheesh, M.;Bushiri, M.

A two-step solid state synthesis of LiFePO4/C cathode with varying carbon contents for Li-ion batteries,"Olivine structured LiFePO4/carbon composites with different amounts of carbon were prepared by a modified two-step solid-state reaction. The iron citrate used as both iron and carbon sources in the reaction resulted in the formation of carbon coatings on the olivine particles as the mixed precursors were heated at three different initial-step temperatures of 200, 300 and 400°C followed by a second-step annealing at moderate temperatures of 700°C. The obtained final powders with varying carbon contents were systematically analyzed by characterization techniques of thermo-gravimetric analysis, X-ray powder diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, and field-emission transmission electron microscopy prior to electrochemical testing in order to determine the structural and calcination effects on the electrochemical properties of the composites. The field-emission transmission electron microscopy images revealed that the morphology of the LiFePO4 composites consist of agglomerated particles surrounded by carbon as a conductive material. Among the prepared samples, the LiFePO4/carbon composite calcined at initial-step temperature of 300°C showed the highest discharge capacity and the best rate capability in the voltage range of 2.5–4.2V.","Gim, Jihyeon;Song, Jinju;Nguyen, Diem;Hilmy Alfaruqi, Muhammad;Kim, Sungjin;Kang, Jungwon;Rai, Alok Kumar;Mathew, Vinod;Kim, Jaekook",2014-01-31,Ceramics International,"Lithium iron phosphate,Cathode materials,Solid-state synthesis,Lithium-ion batteries",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.07.043,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.07.043
Structural characterization of plasma sprayed basalt–SiC glass–ceramic coatings,"In the present study, the effect of SiC addition on properties of basalt base glass–ceramic coating was investigated. SiC reinforced glass–ceramic coating was realized by atmospheric air plasma spray coating technique on AISI 1040 steel pre-coated with Ni+5wt.%Al bond coat. Composite powder mixture consisted of 10%, 20% and 30% SiC by weight were used for coating treatment. Controlled heat treatment for crystallization was realized on pre-coated samples in argon atmosphere at 800°C, 900°C and 1000°C which determined by differential thermal analysis for 1–4h in order to obtain to the glass–ceramic structure. Microstructural examination showed that the coating performed by plasma spray coating treatment and crystallized was crack free, homogeneous in macro-scale and good bonded. The hardness of the coated samples changed between 666±27 and 873±32HV0.01 depending on SiC addition and crystallization temperature. The more the SiC addition and the higher the treatment temperature, the harder the basalt base SiC reinforced glass–ceramic coating became. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the coatings include augeite [(CaFeMg)–SiO3], diopside [Ca(Mg0.15Fe0.85)(SiO3)2], albite [(Na,Ca)Al(Si,Al)3O8], andesine [Na0.499Ca0.492(Al1.488Si2.506O8] and moissanite (SiC) phases.

Effect of CVD ZrB2 coating thickness on anti-ablation performance of C/SiC composites,"In this study, ZrB2 coatings with different thicknesses were prepared using chemical vapor deposition on SiC (~100 µm in thickness) coated C/SiC (SiC-C/SiC) composites, and the ablation behaviors were investigated using oxyacetylene torch tests for 20 s. SiC-C/SiC composites with ZrB2 coatings exhibited improved anti-ablation properties compared to uncoated composites, but anti-ablation properties first increased and then decreased with an increase in ZrB2 coating thickness. Composites with 10 µm ZrB2 coating exhibited the best anti-ablation properties, and linear and mass ablation rates were reduced by 38% and 61%, respectively, compared to uncoated composites. Anti-ablation properties of composites with thicker ZrB2 coatings decreased because of cracks and defects in coatings caused by residual thermal stress that resulted from differences in thermal expansion coefficients between the coating and substrate. During oxyacetylene torch tests, ZrB2 and SiC were oxidized to ZrO2 and SiO2 and formed four layers as thermal barriers that provided ablation protection for inner part and prevented it from being further ablated.","Zhu, Yan;Cheng, Laifei;Ma, Baisheng;Liu, Yongsheng;Zhang, Litong",2018-05-31,Ceramics International,"ZrB2 coating,Thickness optimization,Chemical vapor deposition,Ablation mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.264,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.264
Iron doped thin TiO2 films synthesized with the RF PECVD method,"Iron doped titanium dioxide coatings were synthesized with the help of RF plasma enhanced CVD technique. As a source of titanium, titanium chloride (IV) TiCl4 was used while iron pentacarbonyl (0) Fe(CO)5 served as iron supply. The coatings were diagnosed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Their elemental and chemical composition was studied with the help of X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, respectively. For the determination of their optical properties, variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy techniques were used. Iron content in the range of 0.07–11.5 at% was found in the films. Apart from oxygen, titanium and iron, a presence of trace amounts of chlorine, very likely originating from the titanium precursor, was recorded. FTIR studies showed that iron was built-in in the structure of TiO2 matrix. Surface roughness, assessed using SEM and AFM techniques, increases with an increasing content of this element. VASE measurements revealed an increase of the coatings refractive index with a growing iron concentration, with the extinction coefficient remaining low and independent of that parameter. Trace amounts of iron resulted in a lowering of an absorption threshold of the films as well as their optical gap, but the tendency was reversed for high concentrations of that element.","Sobczyk-Guzenda, A.;Owczarek, S.;Szymanowski, H.;Volesky, L.;Walkowiak, B.;Miszczak, S.;Gazicki-Lipman, M.",2015-07-31,Ceramics International,"C.

"Hot corrosion behavior of Ba2REAlO5 (RE = Dy, Er, Yb) ceramics by vanadium pentoxide at 900–1000°C","Hot corrosion behavior of Ba2REAlO5 (RE = Dy, Er, Yb) ceramics exposed to V2O5 molten salt at 900°C and 1000°C was investigated, providing a better understanding of their corrosion resistance as promising thermal barrier coatings. Obvious surface reactions occurred forming continuous, dense reaction layers on the top surfaces of the samples, the types of corrosion products being temperature and time independent. After heat treatment for 4h and 20h in V2O5 salt at the two temperatures, the corrosion products consisted of REVO4, Ba2REV3O11 and BaAl2O4 (RE = Dy, Er, Yb). Prolonged heat treatment and elevated temperature promoted the growth of Ba2REV3O11 and REVO4 grains. The reaction layer had a positive function on suppressing further penetration of the molten salt. The mechanism by which the corrosion reaction occurs is proposed based on Lewis acid-base rule, phase diagrams and thermodynamics.","Zhang, Chenglong;Guo, Lei;Yu, Jianxing;Li, Mingzhu;Ye, Fuxing;Ji, Vincent",2017-10-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Ba2REAlO5,Surface reaction,V2O5,Hot corrosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.043,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.043
Microstructure and mechanical properties of plasma spraying coatings from YSZ feedstocks comprising nano- and submicron-sized particles,"Atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) is an attractive technique to obtain nanostructured coatings due to its versatility, simplicity and relatively low cost. However, nanoparticles cannot be fed into the plasma using conventional feeding systems, due to their low mass and poor flowability, and must be adequately reconstituted into sprayable micrometric agglomerates. In this work, nanostructured and submicron/nanostructured powders of yttria-stabilised zirconia (YSZ) were deposited using APS, with a view to obtaining high-performance thermal barrier coatings (TBC). All powders were reconstituted by spray-drying from different solid loading suspensions, followed by a thermal treatment of the spray-dried granules to reduce agglomerate porosity and enhance powder sinterability. The reconstituted granules were characterised by XRD, SEM, pore sizing and flowability evaluation. The reconstituted feedstocks were successfully deposited onto metallic substrates by APS. A metallic bond coat was sprayed between the substrate and the ceramic layer. The coating microstructure, characterised by SEM, was formed by partially melted zones, which retained the initial powder microstructure, embedded in a fully melted matrix which acts as a binder. It was shown that feedstock characteristics which in turn are very dependent of starting suspension characteristics, in particular agglomerate density and primary particle size, impact on coating microstructure (porosity and amount of partially-melted areas). For this reason mechanical properties of coatings are also strongly affected by feeding powder characteristics.","Carpio, Pablo;Borrell, Amparo;Salvador, María Dolores;Gómez, Andrés;Martínez, Eduardo;Sánchez, Enrique",2015-04-30,Ceramics International,"YSZ coatings,Atmospheric plasma spraying,Reconstituted powders,Thermal barrier coatings",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.11.106,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.11.106
Oxidation and thermal shock resistant properties of Al-modified environmental barrier coating on SiCf/SiC composites,"SiCf/SiC ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) are being widely used in the hot-sections of gas-turbines, especially for aerospace applications. These CMCs are subjected to surface recession if exposed to heat-corrosion. In this research, an alternative environmental barrier coating (EBC) is introduced to protect the SiCf/SiC CMC from high temperature degradation that is, Al film was deposited on the surface of SiCf/SiC CMC followed by heat-treatment in a vacuum. After that, a dense Al2O3 overlay was in-situ synthesized on the surface of CMC, and in this process the microstructure evolution of SiCf/SiC CMC was analyzed. The oxidation and thermal shock resistance were characterized, showing that the Al-modified SiCf/SiC CMC has a better oxidation resistance, because the dense Al2O3 overlay can hinder oxygen diffusion from environment. What is more, the water-quenching testes show that the Al-modified SiCf/SiC CMC has a good spallation resistance.","Zhang, X.F.;Zhou, K.S.;Liu, M.;Deng, C.M.;Deng, C.G.;Niu, S.P.;Xu, S.M.",2017-11-30,Ceramics International,"EBC,SiCf/SiC,Al-modification,Oxidation resistance,Thermal shock resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.167,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.167
Lead-less mesoscopic perovskite solar cells with enhanced photovoltaic performance by strontium chloride substitution,"The substitution of toxic lead (Pb) in efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is a key problem for commercialization. In this paper, strontium chloride (SrCl2)-doped lead-less PSCs were constructed successfully, and the effect of Sr substitution on the perovskite film formation and its photovoltaic property was investigated in detail by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV–visible absorption, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses. It is demonstrated that the introduction of Sr substitution changes the chemical composition of PbI2 precursors and reduces the excess PbI2 in the perovskite films. A 10 mol% Sr substitution in the PbI2 precursor solution can increase the absorbance of the resultant perovskite film and enhance the electron extraction at the “perovskite/TiO2” interface, thus increasing the device's short-circuit current density (J sc) from 17.41 mA cm-2 to 19.45 mA cm-2. At the same time, Sr substitution can reduce the charge combination in the PSC, which allows the PSC to obtain a higher open-circuit voltage (V oc) of 1.08 V and fill factor (FF) of 0.74. Finally, the PSC prepared with 10 mol% Sr substitution exhibits a considerable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.64%, showing an improvement of 18.9% compared to that of the pristine device.","Zhang, Huanyu;Liu, Wenwu;Li, Rui;Zhang, Mei;Guo, Min",2018-10-15,Ceramics International,"Lead-less perovskites,Perovskite solar cells,Two-step spin-coating,Defect density",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.121,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.121

Durable superhydrophobic Zn/ZnO/TiO2 surfaces on Ti6Al4V substrate with self-cleaning property and switchable wettability,"Durable superhydrophobic (SHP) Zn/ZnO/TiO2 surfaces with dendritic structures on Ti6Al4V substrate were obtained by chemical etching, electrodeposition and following annealing process. The resultant coatings electrodeposited at −1.5V for 10min and annealed at 190°C for 60min showed fine superhydrophobicity with a water contact angle of 160° and a rolling angle less than 1°, showing excellent rolling-off and self-cleaning properties. The morphology, chemical components and growth mechanism of samples were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD), Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Surface tribological properties were characterized by a universal mechanical tester (UMT). The as-prepared Zn/ZnO/TiO2 surface still kept excellent SHP stability after exposure to the air, buried in soil and cold storage at 5°C in the fridge for one year, as well as excellent repellence to some daily-used liquids such as coke, coffee, red wine, milk and tea. The surface can be reversibly switched between superhydrophobicity and superhydrophilicity by alternating UV illumination and dark storage or heating, which offer possibilities to widen future applications.","He, Ge;Lu, Shixiang;Xu, Wenguo;Yu, Tianlong;Li, Jingyan;Dai, Tanlong",2018-01-31,Ceramics International,"Ti6Al4V,Electrodeposition,Superhydrophobic,Self-cleaning,Stability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.223,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.223
Laser-induced deposition of alumina ceramic coating on stainless steel from dry thin films for surface modification,"A new technique of depositing a hard ceramic coating onto stainless steel substrate by irradiating sol–gel dry alumina films using laser technology has been successfully achieved. The phase composition, crystalline structure and surface morphology of laser-deposited alumina coatings on the substrate surface were characterised by ATR-FTIR, XRD, SEM and EDS, whilst the mechanical properties of the alumina-coated surface were measured using nano-indentation. The results show that laser irradiation of dry alumina films led to the deposition of crystalline alumina coating in α-Al2O3 form on substrate surface. Nano-indentation measurements reveal that the mechanical properties of the alumina-coated surface are significantly improved and reach the same level as pure α-alumina ceramic.","Adraider, Y.;Pang, Y.X.;Nabhani, F.;Hodgson, S.N.;Sharp, M.C.;Al-Waidh, A.",2014-05-31,Ceramics International,"Sol–gel,Dry thin alumina films,Laser deposition,Alumina coatings,Stainless steel substrates",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.11.067,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.11.067
A robust carbon coating strategy toward Ni-rich lithium cathodes,"The surface coating strategy provide a facile and effective means of improving the electrochemical behavior of lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) since it can prevent cathodes/anodes from contacting moisture and improve the thermal stability and cyclability of LiBs. However, to date, few studies have focused on carbon coating Ni-rich cathodes due to the moisture sensitivity of cathode materials. Herein, poly (vinylidene fluoride)/n-vinyl-2-pyrrolidinone (PVDF/NMP) solution was employed as the carbon source to coat LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) spheres for the first time. The coating process mainly includes two steps under moisture-free conditions: (1) wetting NMC811 using PVDF/NMP solution and (2) heat treatment of NMC811/PVDF under inert circumstances. The thickness of the obtained carbon layer can be controlled easily by adjusting the solution concentration. A 2.5 wt% PVDF containing solution can coat a carbon layer of ~4 nm on NMC811 spheres, which significantly improved the integral Li+ storage performance. The discharge capacity of the resulting carbon-coated NMC811 showed only a 1.26% decrease after 100 cycles at a 0.2 C rate, while pristine NMC811 lost 6.85% of its initial reversible capacity. This work highlights that carbon coating offers a facile yet effective approach to achieve high-performance cathodes materials for LIBs.","Chen, Gang;Peng, Biyou;Han, Rui;Chen, Nanxi;Wang, Zhongzui;Wang, Qian",2020-09-30,Ceramics International,"LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2,Carbon coating,Polymer,Lithium-ion battery",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.160,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.160
Highly enhanced sinterability of fine-grained Ba0.6Sr0.4TiO3−MgO bulk ceramics and in-situ nanocomposite thick films,"Well-developed, dense and fine-grained MgO–(Ba0.6Sr0.4)TiO3 with 40wt% MgO content (denoted as BST–MgO) bulk ceramics were fabricated by high-energy ball mechanochemical technique using a hybrid processing. Based on this technique, the fabrication temperature was as low as 1200°C i.e., 200°C lower than that required by using conventional solid-state process. At the same time, dense, homogeneous and crack-free ceramic–ceramic 0–3 nanocomposite BST–MgO thick film was obtained at 700°C using the spin-coating method. At 10kHz and room temperature, the BST–MgO bulk ceramics exhibited a moderate dielectric constant of about 500 and low loss tangent of less than 0.005; while for the nanocomposite thick films, the dielectric constant and loss tangent were about 140 and less than 0.03 (at 100kHz) respectively. In addition, both the bulk ceramics and thick film show a broad and diffused phase transition. The dielectric room-temperature tunabilities measured at 100kHz were found to be 4% at 1.5kV/mm for the bulk ceramic, and 17% at 10kV/mm for nanocomposite thick film.","Zhang, Hongfang;Kong, Ling Bing;Mak, Chee-Leung;Kwok, Kin-Wing;Wang, Yu;Lai-Wa Chan, Helen",2014-08-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Spraying power influence on microstructure and bonding strength of ZrSi2 coating for SiC coated carbon/carbon composites,"The objective of this current paper was to characterize the ZrSi2 coating deposited on the SiC coated carbon/carbon (C/C) composites by supersonic atmospheric plasma spraying (SAPS) at different spraying power. The microstructure, phase composition and bonding strength were investigated. In the process of spraying, a few of ZrSi2 powders were quickly oxidized to produce ZrO2, SiO2 and ZrSiO4 ceramic phases. These phases were randomly embedded in the ZrSi2 coating to enhance the mechanical performances of the coating to some extent. In addition, t-ZrO2 and c-ZrO2 phases formed above 1473K might be converted into m-ZrO2 accompanied with 8% volume expansion, which can heal part of microcracks of the ZrSi2 coating. Therefore, only a few microcracks and pores at the spraying power of 40kW were found at the surface of ZrSi2 coating and no penetrative cracks existed in the cross section. Meanwhile, the bonding strength of the interface between the ZrSi2 and the SiC coating reached up to 11N at 40kW. In short, the SAPS technology was deemed to be a useful method to deposit the ZrSi2 coating on SiC coated C/C composites with high performance.","Liu, Fei;Li, Hejun;Gu, Shengyue;Yao, Xiyuan;Fu, Qiangang",2018-04-15,Ceramics International,"ZrSi2 coating,SiC coated carbon/carbon composites,Supersonic atmospheric plasma spraying,Bonding strength",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.068,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.068
Ablation behavior and mechanism of C/C–ZrC–SiC composites under an oxyacetylene torch at 3000°C,"C/C–ZrC–SiC composites with continuous ZrC–SiC ceramic matrix were prepared by a multistep technique of precursor infiltration and pyrolysis process. Ablation properties of the composites were tested under an oxyacetylene flame at 3000°C for 120s. The results show that the linear ablation rate of the composites was about an order lower than that of pure C/C and C/C–SiC composites as comparisons, and the mass of the C/C–ZrC–SiC composites increased after ablation. Three concentric ring regions with different coatings appeared on the surface of the ablated C/C–ZrC–SiC composites: (i) brim ablation region covered by a coating with layered structure including SiO2 outer layer and ZrO2–SiO2 inner layer; (ii) transition ablation region, and (iii) center ablation region with molten ZrO2 coating. Presence of these coatings which acted as an effective oxygen and heat barrier is the reason for the great ablation resistance of the composites.","Xie, Jing;Li, Kezhi;Li, Hejun;Fu, Qiangang;Guo, Lingjun",2013-05-31,Ceramics International,"C.

The lattice parameters of these pyrochlores increase with the RE radii increasing in the order from Sm to La. RE 2Hf2O7 with RE = Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm and Sm have similar mechanical and thermal properties. However, for mechanical and thermal properties, La2Hf2O7 is lower than other pyrochlores. Thermal conductivities of these materials are in the range of 1.38–1.62 W m−1 K−1 which are all lower than the thermal conductivity of yttria stabilized zirconia. Therefore, rare earth hafnate pyrochlores are predicted to promising candidates as thermal barrier coatings.","Sun, Mingcheng;Sui, Yuqiu;Gao, Kai;Tan, Che;Dai, Li;Zhou, Guiping;Zhang, Yanjun",2019-06-15,Ceramics International,"Rare earth oxides,Mechanical properties,Thermal conductivity,First-principles calculations",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.108,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.108
A novel method to fabricate composite coatings via ultrasonic-assisted electro-spark powder deposition,"To improve traditional electro-spark deposition (ESD) technology and meet the requirements for special applications, a novel ultrasonic-assisted electro-spark powder deposition (UEPD) process is developed in this study. The unique electrode tool in this new method consists of a NiCrBSi alloy powder as a deposition material and a Cu electrode core as a support component, which are bonded to each other by means of a silver-containing conductive adhesive. By using this UEPD process, a metal matrix composite (MMC) coating is successfully fabricated on ASTM 1045 steel. The coating has an average thickness of approximately 52.3 μm and exhibits efficient metallurgical bonding with the substrate as well as good continuity. The microstructure in the coating mainly presents submicron-columnar dendrites that epitaxially grow perpendicular to the substrate surface, which mainly contain a Ni-rich γ-(Ni, Fe) solid solution, intermetallic FeNi3 and Cr-rich carbide and boride precipitates. These refined grains and hard reinforcements significantly increase the hardness and tribological properties of the coating. Combining the discharge morphology, microstructure and chemical composition of the UEPD electrode and coating, the formation process of the UEPD coating is analysed and discussed in detail. The adhesive NiCrSiB powder layer was melted and transferred to the surface of the substrate during the UEPD process. The separation of the powder tends to start from the interface of the powder layer and electrode core due to weak connectivity. This behaviour is considered beneficial to the quantitative control of powder deposition. In addition, the introduction of ultrasonication can promote dispersion of the metal droplets to obtain a better quality coating.","Zhao, Hang;Gao, Chang;Wu, Xiao-yu;Xu, Bin;Lu, Yan-jun;Zhu, Li-kuan",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"A.

The influence of chelating agents on cerium oxide decorated on graphite synthesized by the hydrothermal route,"Morphology features of cerium oxide nanoparticles, such as size and agglomeration, are important as a coating that improves corrosion resistance and as reinforcement in mechanical applications. In this work, the influence of two heat treatments (160° and 190 °C) in combination with three different chelating agents in the preparation of CeO2 and CeO2 decorated on graphite (CeO2_Gr) nanoparticles is studied. The novelty of this work is that CeO2_Gr was successfully prepared using the hydrothermal method. All the samples evaluated by X-ray diffraction exhibit a single fluorite-type structure in the cubic phase and Fm3m space group. The spherical harmonics method using the Fullprof Suite program was used to determine the average crystallite sizes, which were 9 nm for CeO2 and 7 nm for CeO2_Gr. Transmission electron micrographs for the prepared samples with citric acid showed non-agglomerate particles with homogeneous particle sizes and a quasi-spherical shape distribution. Raman spectra show a band centre at 600 cm-1 associated with the presence of Frenkel-type oxygen vacancies that induced the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+. The analysis of X-ray photoelectron spectra corroborates the coexistence of Ce3+ and Ce4+ species for CeO2 and CeO2_Gr nanoparticles. This work forms new perspectives in the development of CeO2 decorated on graphite prepared by the hydrothermal method to obtain composites not only for sensing applications and wastewater treatment but also for corrosion resistance and reinforcement materials.","Camacho-Ríos, M.L.;Cristóbal-García, J.D.;Lardizabal-Gutiérrez, D.;Estrada-Guel, I.;Herrera-Pérez, G.;Piñón-Espitia, M.;Martínez-Sánchez, R.",2020-08-01,Ceramics International, ,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.197,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.197
Magnetoelectric coupling of LaFeO3/BiFeO3 heterostructures,BiFeO3 (BFO) and LaFeO3 (LFO) heterostructures were obtained at room temperature on Pt/TiO2/SiO2/Si (100) substrates by chemical solution deposition. The films were coherently grown at a temperature of 500°C for 2h. The magnetoelectric coefficient measurement was performed to show magnetoelectric coupling behavior of such heterostructures. The bottom BFO layer in the heterostructure was able to promote the grain growth of the LFO during the annealing process resulting in huge crystal size. Dielectric permittivity and dielectric loss measurements demonstrated only slight dispersion with frequency due to the lower two-dimensional stress in the plane of the film. Improvement of the P–E hysteresis loop was observed for the heterostructure due the decrease of leakage current caused by the LFO sublayer.

Preparation and formation mechanism of C/C–SiC composites using polymer-Si slurry reactive melt infiltration,"This study proposes a polymer-metal slurry reactive melt infiltration (RMI) method to overcome the limitations of conventional RMI in modifying irregular geometric carbon–carbon (C/C) preforms. Herein, polycarbosilane (PCS), polysiloxane, phenol-formaldehyde, and epoxy resin, which were introduced to prepare slurries with Si powder, and subsequently used to modify cylindrical C/C preforms into C/C–SiC composites. Results show that the PCS–Si slurry has the best RMI capability, by which, a cylindrical C/C preform (1.35 g·cm−3) was modified successfully to into a dense C/C–SiC composite (1.92 g·cm−3). PCS plays a vital role in fixing the coating to prevent it from falling off the surface of the C/C preform in PCS–Si slurry RMI. Both of the degree of densification and flexural strength of the C/C–SiC composites increase with an increase in the thickness of the PCS–Si slurry coating. The overreaction of the PCS–Si slurry RMI was effectively suppressed because the content of Si powder is reasonably controlled in the PCS–Si slurry coating. Moreover, nozzle-shaped C/C composites were successfully modified into a C/C–SiC composite for the first time using PCS–Si slurry RMI.","Guo, Wenjian;Ye, Yicong;Bai, Shuxin;Zhu, Li'an;Li, Shun",2020-04-01,Ceramics International,"Reactive melt infiltration,C/C–SiC composite,Microstructures,Mechanical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.002
Enhanced performance of a macroporous ceramic support for nanofiltration by using α-Al2O3 with narrow size distribution,"Enhanced performance of a macroporous disk alumina support was fabricated through colloidal filtration route, by using α-Al2O3 powder with an average particle size of 1.1μm. The support, sintered at 1250°C, showed relative high permeances towards water (101Lh−1 m−2 bar−1) and nitrogen (∼2×10−6 molm−2 s−1 Pa−1), with an average surface roughness of ∼175nm and a high mechanical strength of 61.1MPa. Titania supported γ-Al2O3 mesoporous layers were deposited onto this promising disk α-Al2O3 support through dip-coating. The disk membrane A1100/TiO2/γ-Al2O3, with pore size of ca. 4.4nm, showed a pure water flux as high as 4.5Lm−2 h−1 bar−1, which is four times higher than that of γ-Al2O3 membrane reported in literature. This mesoporous membrane showed relative high retention rate (∼80%) towards di-valent cations like Ca2+, Mg2+, but not for the mono-valent cation (Na+).","Qi, Hong;Niu, Shufeng;Jiang, Xiaoluo;Xu, Nanping",2013-04-30,Ceramics International,"Ceramic membranes,Macroporous alumina support,Nanofiltration,Permeability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.09.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.09.004
A cost effective solution for development of broadband radar absorbing material using electronic waste,"Electronic-waste items like disassembled mobile and computer printed circuit boards (PCBs) have been processed in a high energy planetary ball-mill for 10h, to investigate the dielectric, magnetic and radar absorbing properties. The main goal of present paper is to achieve wide bandwidth for <−10dB reflection loss at minimum cost in the frequency range of 8.2 to 12.4GHz. The frequency dependent complex permittivity and permeability values of electronic waste composite material have been measured using transmission/reflection approach, and are used for computation of reflection loss with varying absorber layer thickness ranging from 1.0 to 3.5mm. A single layer absorber is fabricated with optimal coating thickness of 2.5mm (i.e., thickness value for reflection loss <−10dB). The measured reflection loss value has been found to −27.98dB at 9.3GHz with absorber layer thickness of 2.5mm, which may ascribe to proper impedance matching and large dielectric loss. Moreover, broadest bandwidth (for <−10dB reflection loss) covering the maximum frequency range of X-band has been noticed as 3.9GHz. Results demonstrate the enormous potential of the electronic waste composite material to act as highly efficient, cost effective, and broadband radar wave absorber for various practical electromagnetic applications.","Panwar, Ravi;Agarwala, Vijaya;Singh, Dharmendra",2015-03-31,Ceramics International,"Radar absorbing material (RAM),Printed circuit boards (PCBs),Electronic waste composite material,Reflection loss",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.10.118,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.10.118
Enhancing cover glass fracture resistance for hand-held devices with PEALD-based Al2O3 coating,"Chemically strengthened glass (also known as ion exchanged glass) is widely used for hand-held devices due to excellent mechanical strength. However, only top and bottom planar surfaces are sufficiently protected following a series of machining processes such as drilling, cutting and milling for manufacturing and assembly. Micro cracks that remain on the machined surface of the glass edges become very vulnerable to shock impact loading. In this study we suggest a novel PEALD technique to encapsulate surface defects with a 100 nm thickness layer of high-strength ceramics such as Al2O3. In order to optimize PEALD parameters, we have examined best practices for testing chemically strengthened cover glasses. By conducting both Charpy impact test and 3-point bending test, it was found that impact resistance and flexural toughness of the PEALD-coated cover glass were 35%–40% and 21% higher compared to non-coated samples. Through the analysis of the state and elements of the machined surface with Al2O3 (500 nm) coating it was verified that the coated layer uniformly covers the entire surface of the glass and fully infiltrates into the micro cracks. This study confirms that Al2O3 ceramic coated with PEALD improves not only overall glass strength, but also overcomes the shortcomings of chemically strengthened glass machining.","Gao, Jiachen;Kim, Hoyeon;Kim, Jaeyeol;Kwak, Jae B.",2019-10-15,Ceramics International,"Cover glass,Micro cracks,Plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD),Chemically strengthened glass,Impact resistance,Flexural toughness",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.207,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.207
Effect of carbon nanotubes and aluminum oxide on the properties of a plasma sprayed thermal barrier coating,"To protect the structural components of a power generating unit from the corrosive environment, thermal spray coatings are applied to the components. In the present work, four different types of thermal barrier coating (TBC) viz. partially stabilised zirconia (8YSZ), zirconia-20% alumina (ZA) composite coating without carbon nanotube (CNT) reinforcement, and ZA with 1% and 3% CNT reinforcement. The coating was deposited on NiCrAlY coated P91 steel using a plasma spraying process. The coating microstructure and phases were characterised using field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The phases of the coating were analyzed using X-ray diffraction technique. The effect of CNT reinforcement on the thermal conductivity, porosity, and hardness of the composite coatings was investigated. The protective behavior of the coatings was characterised by potentiodynamic polarization testing and electrochemical impedance measurements. The thermal conductivity of the composite coating was found to be increased with increasing CNT content. Hardness was found to be highest for 3% CNT reinforcement and the thermal conductivity was found to increase with decreasing porosity. The electrochemical measurements indicate that reinforcement of CNT in zirconia alumina composite coating improved its corrosion resistance.","Thakare, J.G.;Mulik, R.S.;Mahapatra, M.M.",2018-01-31,Ceramics International,"Plasma (A),Porosity (B),Corrosion(C),CNT (D)",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.196,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.196
Developing and preparing interfacial coatings for high tensile strength silicon nitride fiber reinforced silica matrix composites,"A three-dimensional silicon nitride fiber fabric with Pyrolytic carbon (PyC) interlayer reinforced silica matrix composites (Si3N4f/PyC/SiO2) were prepared by sol-gel method, and the mechanical properties of the composites were investigated. The tensile strength of Si3N4f/PyC/SiO2 composites at room temperature exceeded 73.8MPa, and the tensile strengths at 1200°C and 1400°C were 60.9MPa and 58.2MPa, respectively. Compared with Si3N4f/SiO2 composites without PyC coating, the strength of Si3N4f/PyC/SiO2 composites improved significantly, particularly at high temperature. The experimental results show that PyC interlayer could protect silicon nitride fibers from high temperature interfacial reaction between fibers and matrix. Meanwhile, considerable fiber pull-out was observed throughout the fracture surface of Si3N4f/PyC/SiO2 composites indicating that the interface bonding was weak, which resulted in the high mechanical strength of Si3N4f/PyC/SiO2 composites.","Zhang, Juan;Fan, Jinpeng;Zhang, Jingyi;Zhou, Jun;Liu, Xiaoming;Qie, Dongchun;Zhang, Dahai",2018-04-01,Ceramics International,"Silicon nitride fiber,Composites,Tensile strength,PyC coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.143,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.143
Effect of thermal exposure on hardness and Young's modulus of EB-PVD yttria-partially-stabilized zirconia thermal barrier coatings,"The effect of thermal exposure on hardness and Young's modulus of 4.0mol% Y2O3-partially-stabilized ZrO2 coating material deposited by an electron beam physical vapor deposition has been investigated after exposure at 1200°C and 1400°C in air for up to 100h, using an ultra-micro-indentation technique. The indentation tests were carried out with loading rate of 0.88mN/s and holding time of 20s at the maximum load of 50mN. Before and after thermal exposure, the microstructure of the coating was characterized using scanning electron microscopy. Before thermal exposure, the coating showed a typical columnar structure. After thermal exposure, however, the columnar structure degraded and the degradation depended on exposure temperature and time. The hardness and Young's modulus were higher on the plan-section than on the cross-section before and after thermal exposure. The hardness and Young's modulus on both sections significantly increased after thermal exposure. The increases depended on exposure temperature and time, as a result of the sintering effect.","Guo, Shuqi;Kagawa, Yutaka",2006-12-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Fabrication of 8-YSZ thin-wall tubes by powder extrusion moulding for SOFC electrolytes,In this work the processing steps for producing YSZ thin tubes by means of powder extrusion moulding (PEM) technique are investigated. Different feedstocks were prepared from a commercial YSZ powder and a multicomponent thermoplastic binder system based in polypropylene and paraffin wax. The surface coating of YSZ powder with stearic acid in a high-performance dispersing instrument reduces the viscosity of the feedstock one order of magnitude respect to a feedstock with a same composition and un-coated powder. This fact allows increasing the solid loading up to 58vol.% to obtain sintering tubes with densities higher than 97% and with wall thickness lower than 200μm.,"Jardiel, T.;Levenfeld, B.;Jiménez, R.;Várez, A.",2009-08-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Phase stability and thermal conductivity of nanostructured tetragonal yttria–stabilized zirconia thermal barrier coatings deposited by air–plasma spraying,"High performance thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) produced from nanocrystalline 4mol.% Y2O3–stabilized ZrO2 (4YSZ) powder show significant thermal and mechanical property advantages compared with current benchmark products. The objective of the present study was to investigate the phase stability and thermal conductivity of the nanostructured 4YSZ coatings plasma–sprayed from the sol–spray pyrolysis powder. Characterization results indicated that the as–sprayed 4YSZ coatings were chemically very homogeneous and had a completely tetragonal–prime (t′) structure. Such a uniform composition was almost entirely consistent with that of the feedstock powder. The grain size of as–sprayed 4YSZ coatings was in the range of 35 ~ 75nm, which resulted in an extremely low thermal conductivity of 0.8–1.2Wm–1 K–1 in the coatings. The high–temperature aging test showed that no monoclinic ZrO2 (m–ZrO2) phase present at all of the 4YSZ coatings after a heat treatment at 1473K for 1–650h. Furthermore, the phase composition of the 4YSZ coating kept t′–ZrO2 structure after 1500 thermal cycles at a peak surface temperature of 1373K. The relative phase stability was attributed to the highly pure t′ phase composition and uniform constituents in the 4YSZ coatings. These results suggested that the development of high performance 4YSZ ceramic powders was benefit to improve the coating properties for TBC application.","Jiang, Kuo;Liu, Songbai;Wang, Xin",2017-10-15,Ceramics International,"Nanostructure,Thermal barrier coating,Yttria stabilized zirconia,Thermal conductivity,Phase transformation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.142,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.142
Effect of temperature gradient on the erosion behavior of SiC coating for carbon/carbon composites in a combustion environment,"SiC coating with a thickness of 50–70µm was prepared on the surface of C/C composites by in-situ reaction method. The SiC coated C/C composites were then tested in a wind tunnel where a temperature gradient from 200 to 1600°C could be obtained to investigate their erosion behavior. The results of wind tunnel test indicated that the service life of C/C composites was prolonged from 0.5 to 44h after applying the SiC coating. After the wind tunnel test, three typical oxidation morphologies, including glassy SiO2 layer, porous SiO2 layer and clusters of honeycomb-like SiO2 grains, were found on the SiC coated C/C composites. With the decrease of oxidation temperature, the amount of glassy SiO2 declined and the thermal stress increased, which induced the cracking followed by the degradation of the SiC coating.","Zhang, Jia-Ping;Fu, Qian-Gang;Qu, Jun-Ling",2016-12-31,Ceramics International,"Temperature gradient,SiC coating,Oxidation behavior,Mechanical property,Wind tunnel",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.08.174,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.08.174
The features of combustion and structure formation of ceramic materials in the Cr–Al–Si–B system,"Kinetics of the SHS process, stages of chemical transformations and structure formation of ceramic materials in the Cr–Al–Si–B multicomponent system were investigated. The effect of reaction mixtures composition and initial temperature on the combustion rate U c and combustion temperature T c, which reduce with increasing Al content, was studied. An increase in the initial temperature of the SHS process causes a linear increase of U c and T c in the range of T 0=290–750K. This is evidence to the fact that each composition is characterized by the similar combustion mechanism, when the stages of chemical reactions of product formation remain unchanged. However, an increase in T 0 above 750K, probably, may lead to exponential character of U c growth. Furthermore, an increase in Al content increases the proportion of the Al–Si eutectic melt. The dissolution of Cr particles in this melt becomes the rate-limiting stage of the combustion process, thus reducing the effective activation energy approximately from ~290 to ~110kJ/mol. The stages of chemical transformations in the combustion wave were studied; the mechanism of structure formation was proposed. Firstly, the Al–Si eutectic mixture undergoes contact melting followed by formation of the reactionary surface as the melt spreads over the Cr and B particles surface. The melt is saturated with these elements followed by crystallization of CrB and Cr(Si,Al)2 grains. In the Cr- and B-rich areas and low melt concentration, the formation of CrB may occur by solid-phase interaction supported via gas-transport reaction. Dynamic X-ray diffraction confirmed the sequential formation of chromium monoboride CrB and after chromium silicide Cr5Si3 or chromium alumosilicide Cr(Si,Al)2. Force SHS–pressing was used to fabricate ceramic targets for magnetron sputtering of multicomponent coatings.","Pogozhev, Yu.S.;Potanin, A.Yu.;Levashov, E.A.;Kovalev, D.Yu.",2014-12-31,Ceramics International,"SHS,Mechanism,Phase formation,Ceramic materials,Chromium borides and silicides",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.07.068,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.07.068
Optimizing the processing conditions of sodium potassium niobate thin films prepared by sol-gel spin coating technique,"In the present study, potassium sodium niobate (KNN) thin films were synthesized by means of sol-gel spin coating method. Along with the synthesis, the effects of annealing temperature and various number of coating layers on both the structural and electrical properties were looked into. The results of the study revealed that the annealing temperature had a great impact on the properties of KNN. In addition, the XRD diffractograms and texture coefficient of the synthesized films confirmed that a highly oriented orthorhombic perovskite structure was obtained at 650°C, whereas at a relatively higher temperature (700°C), a spurious phase of K4Nb6O17 was evolved. In addition, the growth of KNN at 650°C exhibited a reasonable resistivity value for piezoelectric applications. Looking into the results, it was discovered that the KNN thin films also found to be dependent on a number of coating layers. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) showed that KNN with five coating layers was highly crystalline, cracks-free, and had significantly more homogenous surface morphology and the size of grains being uniform, the resistivity of KNN thin films improved with the increasing number of coating layers i.e., up to five.","Akmal, M.H.

"Microstructures, mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of sprayed Ca–P coating for micropatterning carbon/carbon substrate surface","Carbon/carbon (C/C) surface micropatterning is a method of modifying the surface into the complete and regular geometry. In this work, we introduce a positive effect on bonding strength between sprayed Ca–P coating and surface micropatterning C/C substrate. Interestingly, C/C substrate coated by Ca–P coating provides textured surface for a new bone ingrowth. The sprayed Ca–P coating is then subjected to microwave-hydrothermal (MH) treatment with the aim of eliminating surface defects and obtaining a uniform purity phase. These objectives were achieved in our previous study by the MH method. The molar ratio of Ca/P in the coatings is nearly close to 1, which is far below that of Ca/P for hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, HA, 1.67). The purpose of this article is to transform the phases in the sprayed Ca–P coating, which owns the better bioactivity and high corrosion resistance. In order to raise the molar ratio of Ca/P, the coatings are treated under high-temperature (around 700 °C). They are analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and a fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR). The bonding strength (coating/substrate), biological activity and corrosion resistance of the coatings are investigated. The resulting coatings own the different microstructures and phase compositions from the original sprayed Ca–P coating. Especially, results show that the shear strength of the sprayed Ca–P coating deposited on surface micropatterning C/C substrate increases by 61% which is more than that of the coating on non-surface micropatterning C/C substrate. Additionally, high-temperature treated coating presents a good biological activity and an excellent corrosion resistance of current density (1.3078 × 10-6 A/cm2) and potential (−0.17 VSCE).","Su, Yangyang;Li, Kezhi;Wang, Jing",2020-04-15,Ceramics International,"Surface micropatterning,Carbon/carbon (C/C) substrate,Supersonic atmospheric plasma spray (SAPS),Microwave-hydrothermal (MH),High-temperature treatment",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.233,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.233
Cerium-doped hydroxyapatite/collagen coatings on titanium for bone implants,"The novelty of the present research consists in the possibility of obtaining cerium-doped hydroxyapatite/collagen coatings on the titanium support, to improve the performance of the bone implants. These coatings were deposited on the titanium surface by biomimetic method using a modified supersaturated calcification solution (SCS) additionally containing a cerium source and collagen. Prior to the deposition of the apatite layer, an alkali ÷ thermal oxidation pretreatment has been applied to ensure an increase in the bioactivity of the titanium surface. The coatings were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The EDX and XRD investigations of the coatings indicated that cerium was incorporated in the hydroxyapatite lattice. The collagen presence in the coatings was confirmed by FTIR analysis. The cerium-doped hydroxyapatite/collagen coatings showed good antibacterial efficacy against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, being more effective against Escherichia coli. These coatings have a significant potential to be used in the dental and orthopedic implants, as the osseointegration depends on much more factors than simple formation of hydroxyapatite.","Ciobanu, Gabriela;Harja, Maria",2019-02-01,Ceramics International,"Coating,Cerium-doped hydroxyapatite,Collagen,Titanium",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.290,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.290

Results reveal that Ni–TiN composite nanocoatings synthesized at a magnetic intensity of 0.5T exhibit a compact and exiguous microstructure with fine grains characterized by an average grain size (TiN particles) of approximately 37.6nm. The microstructure, composition, microhardness, and electrochemical properties of the coatings are largely dependent on magnetic intensity. The average size of the nickel grains in the Ni–TiN composite nanocoatings prepared at a magnetic intensity of 0.5T is 67.5nm.

BLnT (Ln=Nd and Sm) powders is found thermally stable at 1500°C after exposure for 110h, and the bulk materials exhibit lamellar structure. BLnT (Ln=Nd and Sm) bulk materials show anisotropy in thermo-physical properties due to the insertion of Ba atoms between [Ln2Ti3O10] (Ln=Nd and Sm) sheets. The thermal conductivities of BLnT (Ln=Nd and Sm) are apparently lower than those of ZrO2–8Y2O3 (8YSZ). Also, BaSm2Ti3O10 exhibits relatively lower thermal conductivity as compared to BaNd2Ti3O10. The thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of BLnT (Ln=Nd and Sm) is found comparable to that of 8YSZ. BaNd2Ti3O10 exhibits relatively larger TEC than BaSm2Ti3O10.

Improved mechanical and wear properties of hybrid Al-Al2O3/GNPs electro-less coated Ni nanocomposite,"Al was successfully reinforced with two ceramics Al2O3 coated Ni and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) coated Ni by electro-less deposition technique to form Al-Al2O3/ x GNPs hybrid nanocomposite ( x = 0 , 0.2 , 0.6 , 1 and 1.4 % ) with improved mechanical and wear properties. Compressive strength, hardness, wear properties and coefficient of friction were investigated. The results indicated that increasing GNPs volume fraction improves compressive strength, hardness and antifriction properties of composites significantly. In comparison with pure aluminum, 1.52- fold increases in the strength, 2.45-fold increase in the hardness and 19.2-fold decreases in the wear rate of Al-10%Al2O3/1.4%GNPs nanocomposite are achieved. This improvement is attributed to the remarkable mechanical strength and excellent self-lubrication of grapheme, the reduction of grain size during electro-less deposition process and the increased efficient stress transfer due to the curled structure of GNPs. Additionally, coating GNPs with Ni particles prevent the formation of Al3C4 intermetallic phase which lead to this large improvement in the wear rate. In comparison with the available results in the literature, electro-less coating of GNPs with Ni provides 2.1 times larger hardness than composite with uncoated GNPs.","Fathy, A.;Abu-Oqail, A.;Wagih, A.",2018-12-15,Ceramics International,"Electro-less coating process,Al-Al2O3/graphene nanocomposite,Mechanical properties,Tribological properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.326,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.326
Preparation and wear properties of magnetic assisted pulse electrodeposited Ni–SiC nanocoatings,"Pure Ni coating and Ni–SiC nanocoatings were deposited on mild steel substrates through magnetically assisted pulse electrodeposition (MAPED) from Watts-type nickel bath containing SiC nanoparticles. The microstructures, compositions, microhardness characteristics and wear properties of the coatings were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), triboindenter in-situ nanomechanical, and wear testing. The results indicated that the Ni–SiC nanocoatings deposited at 0.6 T exhibited exiguous and uniform morphologies with average sizes of Ni and SiC estimated to 45.4 nm and 28.5 nm, respectively. The (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) planes of nickel grains clearly appeared in pure Ni coating and Ni–SiC nanocoating. The Ni–SiC nanocoating prepared at 0.6 T had the highest average microhardness of 878.60 HV. Also, the ultimate depths of pure Ni coating and NS-3 nanocoating were identified as 32.9 µm and 18.2 µm, respectively. On the other hand, pure Ni coating displayed elevated weight mass losses whereas the other three MAPED-deposited Ni–SiC nanocoatings had smaller losses under similar wear testing parameters. In particular, the weight loss of Ni–SiC nanocoating was measured as 42.2 mg at magnetic density of 0.6 T. Finally, the NS-3 nanocoating suffered slight wear while NS-1 and NS-2 nanocoatings were severely destroyed by the ball during wear testing measurements.

The specimens were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), metallurgical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy–energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM–EDX). The results showed that 53 times of thermo cycling test by air cooling and nine times by water quenching can be acquired before the coating failed. In the oxidation tests, compared with the bare sample, the as-synthesized coating reduced the weight gain of the CrMn alloy from 27.99mg/cm2 to 7.16mg/cm2 at 900°C isothermal oxidation (540min). At temperatures higher than 900°C, the ceramic coating diminished the oxidation loss significantly. The compact ceramic layer, mainly formed of BaCrO4, Cr2O3, and SiO2, decreased the element diffusion velocity including O and Fe. The thermal shock resistance was greatly enhanced by the hook-like ceramic which inlayed at the interface of the steel substrate and by the good match of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between the coating and substrate. The proposed protective mechanism of the anti-oxidation and thermal shock resistance properties of the coating is also discussed in this paper.","Shan, X.;Wei, L.Q.;Zhang, X.M.;Li, W.H.;Tang, W.X.;Liu, Y.;Tong, J.;Ye, S.F.;Chen, Y.F.",2015-04-30,Ceramics International,"C.

"A new complex ceramic coating with carbon nanotubes, hydroxyapatite and TiO2 nanotubes on Ti surface for biomedical applications","The present paper is a hybrid approach, proposing the elaboration of a complex ceramic coating on Ti plates, containing TiO2 nanotubes obtained by anodizing, multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) functionalized with –COOH groups and hydroxyapatite. The research led to a new hybrid material with improved characteristics that can be used in biomedical applications. For this purpose we proceeded to functionalize multiwalled carbon nanotubes with –COOH groups. Anodic procedure was used to obtain TiO2 nanotubes. After anodizing, electrodeposition as a cheaper and faster procedure of hybrid material MWCNT-COOH/HA took place. The structure of the hybrid material was identified using infrared spectroscopy (FTIR analysis) and morphological features were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The wettability was evaluated by contact angle measurements and microhardness was determined by a mechanical resistance test. Hemolysis assays were performed and in vitro cell response was investigated. This ceramic coating has an optimal microstructure and morphology, as indicated by SEM, showing a proper surface for the osteoblast adhesion, viability and proliferation. The new ceramic coating has induced an increase of microhardness and of the hemolytic index, in the same time with a decrease of contact angle, but the values remained in the domains of hydrophilic character and of nonhemolytic materials. Therefore, based on osteoblast response as well, we propose a new complex ceramic coating which satisfies exigent requirements and signifies a progress in the field of the implant biomaterials.","Prodana, Mariana;Duta, Marius;Ionita, Daniela;Bojin, Dionezie;Stan, Miruna S.;Dinischiotu, Anca;Demetrescu, Ioana",2015-06-30,Ceramics International,"Carbon nanotubes,Hydroxyapatite,SEM,FTIR,Cell response",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.060,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.060
Microstructure and oxidation behavior of NiCr-chromium carbides coating prepared by powder-fed laser cladding on titanium aluminide substrate,"In the present study, a NiCr–Cr3C2 powder mixture was prepared by mechanical alloying and then coated on titanium aluminide substrates by the powder-fed laser cladding process using a set of optimum parameters. The high temperature oxidation behavior of the substrate and coating was studied by isothermal annealing at 900 °C for 5 h. It was found that the microstructure of the coating is composed of γ solid solution with different chromium carbide phases (Cr3C2, Cr7C3 and Cr23C6). The presence of different chromium carbides in the microstructure of coating can be attributed to the partial melting of primary Cr3C2 and the formation of non-equilibrium carbide phases during rapid cooling of laser cladding. The NiCr-chromium carbide laser cladded coating samples showed superior oxidation resistance compared to the substrate. The oxidation mechanism of both coating and substrate follow the parabolic law, where the parabolic rate constant of the coating was 20% of that of the substrate at 900 °C. Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) and Grazing Angle X-Ray Diffraction (GAXRD) analysis revealed that the surface of the oxide layer formed on the NiCr-chromium carbides coating and the substrate is mostly composed of Cr2O3 and TiO2, respectively.","Aghili, S.E.;Shamanian, M.;Amini Najafabadi, R.;Keshavarzkermani, A.;Esmaeilizadeh, R.;Ali, U.;Marzbanrad, E.;Toyserkani, E.",2020-02-01,Ceramics International,"Powder-fed laser cladding,Additive manufacturing,Oxidation,NiCr–Cr3C2,Titanium aluminide,Oxidation mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.139,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.139
Thermally sprayed wollastonite and wollastonite-diopside compositions as new modulated bioactive coatings for metal implants,"New bioactive wollastonite (W) and wollastonite-diopside (W-D) coatings have been deposited over stainless steel and titanium substrates by oxyacetylene flame spraying to optimize the bioactivity of the metallic implants and to improve the resistance to corrosion as well as the mechanical stability by chemical bonding with the bone. The objective is to analyze and compare the physicochemical characteristics and in vitro response of both wollastonite and wollastonite-diopside coatings. Surface and cross-section characterization, including phases, morphology, thickness, roughness, porosity and hardness were performed for both compositions. XRD analyses revealed that both coatings were mainly amorphous although the presence of small crystalline particles (100 nm) was detected by scanning electron microscopy inspection of the coatings cross-section. The in vitro bioactivity of the coatings was examined by observing the formation of an apatite layer on its surface after soaking the coated samples in simulated body fluid (SBF) solution at 37 °C. The W coating exhibited significantly higher dissolution rate compared with the W-D coating, whereas the latter showed the best combination of chemical and mechanical properties with a modulated interaction with the SBF associated to the presence of Mg2+. Both coatings rapidly developed a thick layer containing hydroxyapatite crystals, suggesting their potential competitive use for coating bone implants.","Garcia, Eugenio;Miranzo, Pilar;Sainz, Maria Antonia",2018-08-01,Ceramics International,"Wollastonite,Diopside,Bioactive Coatings,Thermal spray,Bioactivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.100,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.100
Surface modification of orthopedic implants by optimized fluorine-substituted hydroxyapatite coating: Enhancing corrosion behavior and cell function,"Fluorine may only have negative effects on bone metabolism if the optimum concentration of fluorine would not be determined, especially in osteoporosis. In this study a nano-porous and uniform fluorhydroxyapatite (FA) coating in different concentration of fluorine could be deposited on the 316 L substrate with a thickness of 50 μm. Fluorine can have influence on cell proliferation, matrix production, ALP releasing, coating dissolution rate, bio activity, and corrosion resistivity. The dissolution rate of the coating evaluated by ICP and found with an increase in fluorine due to the elimination of CaO, Ca2+ releasing decreased. The results of SBF and MTT exhibited the fluorine within the apatite structure enhanced the growth of natural apatite and function of human osteoblast like cell (MG-63). Furthermore, cell density and attachment showed an enhancement while fluorine increased. Surprisingly the ALP activity test showed the mineralization ability of coating would be improved significantly in presence of fluorine. Furthermore potentiodynamic polarization showed with increasing fluorine, the current density decreased from 112 to 13 nA/cm2. Corrosion property of FA is higher because it is too stable but can also persuade to severe adverse effects like osteomalacia. According to the achieved results, 75% partially-substituted fluorine within apatite structure was introduced as a proper combination of biocompatibility while 100% substituted fluorine could be a better candidate in corrosion resistant performance.","Mansoorianfar, Mojtaba;Mansourianfar, Mostafa;Fathi, Mohammadhossein;Bonakdar, Shahin;Ebrahimi, Mohsen;Zahrani, Ehsan Mohammadi;Hojjati-Najafabadi, Akbar;Li, Dagang",2020-02-01,Ceramics International,"Fluorhydroxyapatite,Nano-porous,Biocompatibility,ALP activity,Osteoblast cell (MG-63),Corrosion properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.197,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.197
Developing empirical relationships to estimate porosity and microhardness of plasma-sprayed YSZ coatings,"Plasma-sprayed yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) coating has been considered to be a good protective coating material for high-temperature applications on account of its superior properties and life cycle costs. However, thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) have engineering reliability problems in tailoring the microstructure and mechanical properties towards achieving both prime reliance and manufacturing reproducibility. In this work, empirical relationships were developed to estimate TBCs performance characteristics (porosity and microhardness) by incorporating independently controllable atmospheric plasma spray operational parameters (input power, standoff distance and powder feed rate) using the response surface methodology (RSM). A central composite rotatable design with three factors and five levels was chosen to minimize the number of experimental conditions. Within the scope of the design space, the input power and the standoff distance appeared to be the most significant two parameters affecting the coating quality characteristics among the three investigated process parameters. Further, correlating the spray parameters with coating properties enables the identification of characteristics regime to achieve desired quality of YSZ coatings.","Karthikeyan, S.;Balasubramanian, V.;Rajendran, R.",2014-03-31,Ceramics International,"B.

Li-rich layered oxide coated by nanoscale MoOx film with oxygen vacancies and lower oxidation state as a high-performance cathode material,"Li-rich layered cathode material (Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2) is subjected to severe irreversible oxygen evolution for the first cycle, barren rate performance, capacity fading and voltage decay despite the ultrahigh specific capacity over 250 mAh g–1. In this paper, MoOx was grown on the surface of lithium-rich material (LLO) via in situ hydrolysis deposition to ameliorate these problems. The surface of LLO was successfully coated with an amorphous MoOx modification layer, and a spinel phase was induced on the interlayer between the bulk material and the cladding layer, which was characterized by XRD, SEM, XPS and TEM. The Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2 modified with 3 wt% MoOx exhibits the excellent electrochemical performance. The material performs higher capacity retention of 85.8% with 224.2 mAh g–1 compared with the pristine one which retains 75.1% with 187.4 mAh g–1 after 100 cycles at 0.5 C (1 C = 250 mA g–1) and exhibits high rate performance of 192.0 mAh g–1 at 5 C. These outstanding electrochemical properties are attributed to the presence of oxygen vacancies in the MoOx that can effectively accommodate the oxygen from the Li2MnO3 during the first cycle of activation and promote oxygen reversible redox process. The MoOx coating layer can also eliminate side reactions on the surface of the material and maintain the integrity of the oxygen array. Furthermore, the 3d orbitals of lower oxidation state Mo in MoOx extend and partially overlap to form wide t2g bands, combined with the spinel phase possessing fast Li+ diffusion channels, which can significantly reduce the Li+ diffusion energy barrier and improve its rate performance.","Yang, Zhe;Zhong, Jianjian;Li, Jianling;Liu, Yanying;Niu, Bangbang;Kang, Feiyu",2019-01-31,Ceramics International,"Lithium-ion battery,Li-rich cathode material,MoOx,Oxygen vacancy,Spinel phase",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.186,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.186
Plasma-sprayed nanostructured YSZ thermal barrier coatings: Thermal insulation capability and adhesion strength,"Adhesion strength and thermal insulation of nanostructured Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) thermal barrier coatings (TBC) were investigated and compared with those of conventional YSZ TBCs. A Nickel based superalloy (IN-738LC) was used as the substrate with NiCrAlY bond coat, and nanostructured and conventional YSZ top coats were applied by using air plasma spray (APS). The adhesion strength of coatings was evaluated according to ASTM C633-01, and their thermal insulation capability was evaluated using a specially designed test setup at an electrical furnace. The results revealed the nanostructured YSZ coating to have a bimodal microstructure consisting of nanosized particles and microcolumnar grains. The bimodal microstructure of nanostructured coatings prevented crack propagation by splat boundaries and unmelted particles, thereby improving the bonding strength. Also, due to the presence of nano-zones in the microstructure of nano TBCs, coatings exhibited superior thermal insulation capability.","Ghasemi, Reza;Vakilifard, Hamideh",2017-08-15,Ceramics International,"Nanostructured thermal barrier coating,Microstructure,Adhesion strength,Thermal insulation capability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.074,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.074
Laser additive manufacturing and homogeneous densification of complicated shape SiC ceramic parts,"To improve the density of SiC ceramic components with complicated shape built by laser sintering (LS), cold isostatic pressing (CIP) and reaction sintering (RS) were incorporated into the process. In the process of LS/CIP/RS, Phenol formaldehyde resin (PF)-SiC composite powder was prepared by mechanical mixing and cold coating methods, with an optimized content of PF at 18 wt%. For the purpose of obtaining improved density of the sintered body after final reaction sintering, carbon black was added into the initial mixed powder. The material preparation, LS forming and densification steps were optimized throughout the whole fabrication process. The final sintered SiC bodies with the bending strength of 292 ~ 348 MPa and the density of 2.94–2.98 g cm− 3 were prepared using the PF coated SiC-C composite powder and the LS / CIP / RS process. The study further showed a positive and practical approach to fabricate SiC ceramic parts with complicated shape using additive manufacturing technology.","Liu, Kai;Wu, Tian;Bourell, David L.;Tan, Yuanliang;Wang, Jiang;He, Mengqiang;Sun, Huajun;Shi, Yusheng;Chen, Jiaqi",2018-12-01,Ceramics International,"A.

Fabrication of aluminum nitride coatings by electrophoretic deposition: Effect of particle size on deposition and drying behavior,"Electrophoretic technique was used to deposit micro- and nano-sized aluminum nitride coatings on stainless steel surfaces by using a well-dispersed stable suspension produced by addition of AlN powder plus a small amount of iodine to ethanol. Parabolic regime governed the deposition. Electrophoretic deposition for 240s at 100V resulted in formation of a uniformly dense film on the top, but a porous inhomogeneous layer at the bottom. This was attributed to fast deposition of coarse particles and/or agglomerates at large electric fields. After drying, micro-sized particles led to a uniform crack-free interface while nano-particles resulted in fragmented non-cohesive layers. Weight loss measurements revealed higher drying rates for micro-layer as compared to nano-cover. This seemed owing to the larger pore sizes and lower specific surfaces of the former. Stress inducement by lateral drying of small capillaries led to crack initiation from the edges and its propagation across the surfaces. This resulted in fragmentation of the samples due to their delamination. Effect of deposition rate on particles packability was also investigated.","Abdoli, H.;Zarabian, M.;Alizadeh, P.;Sadrnezhaad, S.K.",2011-01-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Effect of TGO evolution and element diffusion on the life span of YSZ/Pt–Al and YSZ/NiCrAlY coatings at high temperature,"In this work, the growth of thermally grown oxides (TGO) on Pt–Al and NiCrAlY bond coats and the element diffusion behavior were investigated. During oxidation, TGO initiated at YSZ/Pt–Al interface developed from a α-Al2O3 mono-layer to a α-Al2O3+NiO/α-Al2O3 double-layer with the increase of thermal cycling temperature. While for YSZ/NiCrAlY coating, after exposed at 1100 °C for 240 h, a double-layered TGO was formed at the interface of NiCrAlY/substrate. It is composed of an upper layer of α-Al2O3, Cr2O3 and NiCr2O4 mixture and a bottom layer of α-Al2O3. After the coating was thermal cycled at 1200 °C for 96 h, a triple-layered TGO was generated containing a bottom layer of α-Al2O3, a middle layer of Al2O3 and Cr2O3, and an upper layer of mixed α-Al2O3, Cr2O3 and NiCr2O4. The multi-layered structure of TGO is caused by the difference of element diffusion rate and formation energy of oxides. It facilitates the alternative accumulation and release of stress. Thus, the consequent service life of YSZ/Pt–Al coating is better than that of YSZ/NiCrAlY coating.","Chen, Hongfei;Zhang, Chi;Xuan, Jihang;Liu, Bin;Yang, Guang;Gao, Yanfeng;Luo, Hongjie",2020-01-31,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Thermally grown oxide,Diffusion,Thermal cycling",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.037,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.037
"PVD-CrAlN and TiAlN coated Si3N4 ceramic cutting tools —1. Microstructure, turning performance and wear mechanism","In this work, CrAlN and TiAlN coatings were produced on silicon nitride cutting inserts via physical vapor deposition. The microstructure and hardness of the coatings, as well as the adhesive strength between the coating and the substrate were studied using a scanning electronic microscope, a micro hardness tester and a scratch tester, respectively. Continuous turning tests of the obtained CrAlN and TiAlN-coated silicon nitride cutting inserts were performed on gray cast iron to evaluate the cutting performances and the machining quality. The results show that the surface hardness of the Si3N4 cutting inserts could be improved by 87% and 50%, respectively, when applying the CrAlN and TiAlN coatings, thereby enhancing the abrasion resistance of the cutting inserts. At different tested cutting speeds, abrasive wear under compressional deformation and adhesive wear were identified as the main failure mechanisms for the two cutting inserts during continuous turning of gray cast iron. The machining quality of the gray cast iron workpieces machined using the uncoated, the CrAlN- or the TiAlN-coated inserts increased with the increment of the cutting speed.","Liu, Wei;Chu, Quanquan;Zeng, Junjie;He, Rongxuan;Wu, Haidong;Wu, Ziwei;Wu, Shanghua",2017-08-15,Ceramics International,"C.

Effect of electroless coating parameters and ceramic particle size on fabrication of a uniform Ni–P coating on SiC particles,"The formation of a uniform nickel phosphorous (Ni–P) electroless (EL) coating on micron-sized SiC particles was investigated in this study. Metal coated ceramic particles could be used in applications including as the fabrication of cast metal matrix composites.Such ceramic particles have a better wettability in molten metal. In this work, the effects of EL coating parameters, SiC particle size and morphology on the coating uniformity and mechanical bonding at the SiC/Ni–P interface were studied. The results indicated that etching treatment was very effective (especially for coarse powders) on the mechanical bonding at the interface. Theoptimum values of bath temperature and pH were determined to be 50±2°C and 8±0.2, respectively. The best uniformity and mechanical bonding were obtained for SiC particles with average particle size of 80μm (considered relatively as coarse powders in this study). The ball milling of SiC particles (with the average particle size of 80μm) for 1h led to the formation of a multi-modal particle size distribution which resulted in a non-uniform quality of particulate coating. The larger SiC particles after ball milling were more completely covered by the Ni–P coating compared to the smaller more fragmented particles. The smaller ceramic particles processed via Ni–P EL coating lead to formation of segregated clusters of Ni–P and therefore such ceramic particles contained many uncoated parts.","Beigi Khosroshahi, N.;Azari Khosroshahi, R.;Taherzadeh Mousavian, R.;Brabazon, D.",2014-09-30,Ceramics International,"Ball mill,Electroless,Nickel phosphorous (Ni–P),SEM,SiC particles",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.04.055,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.04.055
Interfacial reactions and matrix microstructure evolution in SiCf/Ti composites dominated by primary structure of Ti matrix,"High-performance continuous SiC fiber reinforced titanium matrix composites (SiCf/Ti) are strongly required by aerospace vehicles, and their properties strongly depend on the microstructure of the interfacial reaction layer and the matrix. Thus, it is important to explore new routes to regulate these two SiCf/Ti components. In this work, α-phase-dominated and β-phase-dominated primary PVD Ti17 coatings were fabricated by controlling the bias voltage during physical vapor deposition (PVD). Their effects on the matrix microstructure evolution and interfacial reactions in SiCf/Ti after consolidation were further explored. It was found that compared with a primary α-Ti PVD Ti17 coating, a primary β-Ti PVD coating induced competitive growth between α-Ti and β-Ti grains in SiCf/Ti17 during consolidation. This yielded a smaller grain size and more β phase in the SiCf/Ti17 evolved from the primary β-Ti coating. In addition, a thicker reaction layer formed, as well as a lower interface strength and tensile strength in the SiCf/Ti17 evolved from a primary β-Ti coating, compared with the SiCf/Ti17 evolved from a primary α-Ti PVD Ti17 coating.","Zhang, Shuming;Wang, Minjuan;Wen, Mao;Wu, Ming;Wang, Qingfeng;Huang, Hao",2019-10-01,Ceramics International,"SiCf/Ti composite,Microstructure,Interfacial reaction,Strength",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.347,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.347
Conductive and radiative heat transfer inhibition in YSZ photonic glass,"A high temperature stable ceramic photonic structure is demonstrated with low thermal conductivity and suppressed external radiative heat transfer. The structure is based on a disordered arrangement of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) microparticles, called photonic glass (PhG). The prepared YSZ-PhG film exhibits low thermal conductivity of 0.03 Wm−1K−1 comparable to that of the air. The small point contacts of the adjacent YSZ particles are the main cause of such low thermal conductivity. After annealing at 1400 °C for 5 h, the solid thermal conductivity increased to 0.3 Wm−1K−1 at room temperature due to the thermally induced neck formation, associated with an increased contact area between adjacent particles. This thermal conductivity is still much lower than that of conventional YSZ thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) with approximately 1 Wm−1K−1. At the same time, the PhG structure is an efficient scatterer for thermal radiation in the wavelength range between 1 and 6 μm. In an only 100 μm thick structure an average reflection of 84% was obtained. At 1400 °C, the effective thermal conductivity is 0.2 Wm−1K−1. The presented structure is applicable to other oxides with even lower bulk thermal conductivity and can be considered for future TBCs.","Shang, Guoliang;Dyachenko, Pavel;Leib, Elisabeth W.;Vossmeyer, Tobias;Petrov, Alexander;Eich, Manfred",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,Photonic glass,Thermal conductivity,Radiative heat transfer,YSZ",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.262,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.262

The corrosion tests were performed at 700°C, 800°C, 900°C and 1000°C for 4h in the presence of Na2SO4+V2O5 molten salt. After corrosion, t′ phase could still be detected on the corroded surfaces and its content decreased with increasing the corrosion temperature. The corrosion products were composed of doped YVO4 and m-ZrO2, but some amounts of Na4V2O7 were found at low corrosion temperatures (700°C and 800°C). The corrosion resistance characteristic of GdYb-YSZ was compared with that of YSZ. Under an identical corrosion condition, GdYb-YSZ had less monoclinic phase formed, indicative of a better hot corrosion resistance. The hot corrosion mechanism was discussed in detail.","Guo, Lei;Zhang, Chenglong;Li, Mingzhu;Sun, Wei;Zhang, Zhaoyang;Ye, Fuxing",2017-02-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs),Doped YSZ,Hot corrosion,Molten salt",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.11.109,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.11.109
Enhanced bonding strength and thermal cycling performance of MoSi2–CrSi2–SiC–Si coating for carbon/carbon composites by surface modification via blasting treatment,"Before the preparation of MoSi2–CrSi2–SiC–Si coating, blasting treatment of carbon/carbon (C/C) composites, as a surface modification method, was conducted under oxyacetylene torch. MoSi2–CrSi2–SiC–Si coating was prepared on the treated C/C composites by pack cementation, where an interlock interface was formed between the coating and the C/C substrate. After blasting treatment, the thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the coating and C/C substrate was alleviated efficiently, and the bonding strength of the coating was increased by 45.6% and reached 26.2MPa. To simulate the real working condition, thermal cycling test was conducted under oxyacetylene torch from 1600°C to room temperature to construct an environment of combustion gas erosion. Due to the improvement of bonding strength and the alleviation of thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the coating and the C/C substrate, thermal cycling performance of MoSi2–CrSi2–SiC–Si coating was enhanced. After 25 thermal cycles, the mass loss of the coated C/C composites without blasting treatment was up to 2.4%, and the C/C substrate was partially exposed. In contrast, the mass loss of the coated C/C composites with blasting treatment was only 1.1%.","Zhang, Jiaping;Fu, Qiangang;Qu, Junling",2016-09-30,Ceramics International,"C/C composites,Blasting treatment,Coating,Thermal cycles",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.008
Fabrication of TiO2-coated nanostructured Ni foams for improved mechanical properties,"We demonstrate a composite approach to improve the mechanical strength of nanostructured Ni foams by producing a conformal coating of TiO2 on the skeletons of the Ni foam. The nanostructured Ni foam is fabricated by a template approach in which colloidal crystals of polystyrene microspheres in 720 nm diameter are constructed by a vertical electrophoresis process, followed by electroplating of Ni to fill the interstitial voids among the closely-packed microspheres and removal of the colloidal template afterward. The formation of TiO2 overcoat is achieved by optimization of sol-gel synthesis to prepare desirable TiO2 sols and their subsequent electrophoresis toward the nanostructured Ni foam in a square wave pulsing mode. The thickness of the TiO2 deposit is proportional to the duration of pulsing electrophoresis. From nano-indentation, the TiO2-coated nanostructured Ni foams exhibit notable improvements in hardness (53–68%) and reduced elastic modulus (26–37%) over those of pristine nanostructured Ni foams. This strategy of implementing a thin ceramic overcoat provides an effective mean to improve the mechanical properties of nanostructured metals.","Hung, Pei-Sung;Chou, Yu-Szu;Wang, Guang-Ren;Chung, Wei-An;Wu, Pu-Wei",2020-02-15,Ceramics International,"TiO2,Ni foams,Electrophoresis,Mechanical properties,Composites",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.126,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.126

It is found that the growth kinetics of thermally grown oxides followed a parabolic law. The apparent porosity within the coatings decreased after isothermal oxidation. The tetragonal prime YSZ phase transformed into cubic and then monoclinic phases during isothermal oxidation. Elastic modulus, microhardness and fracture toughness of the coating increased as oxidation duration prolonged.

Tetraethoxysilane and aluminium sec-butoxide were used to replace silica and alumina, high melting constituents of the raw materials. A homogeneous gel was obtained through sequential hydrolysis by using 5 mol of water per mol of alkoxides, a mixture of ethanol and 2-butanol as solvent, and HCl as catalyst (pH ∼ 3). The remainder of the raw materials was processed to be coated by the gel. Gel as the coating layer was observed to be amorphous and homogeneously bonded around the raw materials particles and was very effective in lowering the melting temperature of the glaze by 30–130°C. This, however, depends on the amount of metal alkoxides used for replacement. TEM, SEM and porosimeter were used to characterize the glaze samples.","Adl, Soheila;Rahman, Ismail.A",2001-12-31,Ceramics International,"Lead free glaze,Sol–gel preparation",10.1016/S0272-8842(01)00019-0,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0272-8842(01)00019-0
Antibacterial properties of laser surface-textured TiO2/ZnO ceramic coatings,"Bacterial attachment on surfaces cause fouling, which reduces the hygiene status and effectiveness of equipment. Preventing bacterial attachment on surfaces through surface modification is a potential solution to fouling and has thus become a key research area. In this study, the effect of different ZnO contents (wt%) and picosecond laser surface texturing on the antibacterial properties of TiO2/ZnO ceramic coatings were investigated. The attachment and viability of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria on laser surface-textured and non-textured TiO2/ZnO ceramic coatings were explored. Bacterial growth in an immersion suspension was evaluated using the optical density method. The number of colony-forming units on laser surface-textured TiO2/ZnO coatings was found to be lower than that on non-textured coatings, which indicates that laser surface-textured coatings demonstrate strong antibacterial properties. Furthermore, the number of viable E. coli bacteria on laser surface-textured TiO2/ZnO coatings was observed to be lower than that on non-textured coatings. This finding also demonstrates that laser surface texturing enhances the antibacterial properties of TiO2/ZnO coatings. Overall, laser surface texturing increased the surface areas of the coatings and improved the effectiveness of ZnO as an antibacterial agent. These results prove that laser surface texturing is a successful method for fabricating antibacterial surfaces.","Yusuf, Yusliza;Ghazali, Mariyam Jameelah;Otsuka, Yuichi;Ohnuma, Kiyoshi;Morakul, Sarita;Nakamura, Susumu;Abdollah, Mohd Fadzli",2020-02-15,Ceramics International,"Surfaces (B),TiO2 (D),ZnO (D),Functional applications (E)",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.124,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.124
Mechanical properties of flame sprayed free-standing coatings,"This paper examines the mechanical properties of rod flame sprayed coatings in the system Al2O3–TiO2–ZrO2. Free-standing thin coatings were tested and a new approach for their preparation was used and assessed in terms of absolute values of bending strength and their standard deviation in comparison with published values for ceramic systems. The Young's modulus shows distinct non-linear behavior. The presence of particle-, micro crack- and/or transformation toughening mechanisms can be seen by comparing mechanical properties of pure alumina- with zirconia containing coatings.","Kratschmer, T.;Aneziris, C.G.;Gruner, P.",2011-09-30,Ceramics International,"C.

Direct and pulse current electrodeposition of Ni–W–TiO2 nanocomposite coatings,"Ni–W–TiO2 nanocomposite coatings have been obtained on mild steel surface by direct current (DC) and pulse current (PC) electrodeposition from Watts bath containing an ammonical citrate complexing agent. The morphology of the coatings was explored by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the composition of the electrodeposits was analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). Surface morphology studies revealed that Ni–W alloy surface was covered by long needle like crystals and Ni–W–TiO2 composite coatings with smaller spherical sized grains. The coated surface contained 25.55% W and 5.55% Ti. XRD studies revealed that (111) plane was predominant in both Ni–W alloy deposits and Ni–W–TiO2 composite coatings. The patterns of the electrodeposits confirmed only fcc frame work structure. Microhardness values increased with TiO2 addition in the alloy. The corrosion resistance of Ni–W alloy deposit and TiO2 incorporated coatings was evaluated by Potentiodynamic polarization studies in 3.5% NaCl solutions. Corrosion current densities decreased with TiO2 inclusion in the alloy deposit. Electrochemical impedance studies revealed that the charge transfer resistance increased with TiO2 inclusion in the alloy deposits while the double layer capacitance decreased. The PC composites coatings offer uniform surface, high microhardness and enhanced corrosion resistance than DC composites coatings.","Arunsunai Kumar, K.;Paruthimal Kalaignan, G.;Muralidharan, V.S.",2013-04-30,Ceramics International,"B.

Dielectric behavior and magnetical response for porous BFO thin films with various thicknesses over Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrate,"A novel sol–gel method has been developed to deposit multiferroic nanocrystalline bismuth ferrite (BFO) thin films over Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrate by spin-coating technique with various thicknesses. It is found that the deposition parameters significantly influence the quality and the thickness of BiFeO3 films. The films are all uniform and adherent to Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrate. The spin-coated films are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Atomic force microscope (AFM), photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Rhombohedral structure of BFO is confirmed from the XRD and FT-IR studies. The SEM image shows a porous structure formation of BFO over Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrate. The surface outgrowth for the films at various thicknesses is measured from root mean square (RMS) and surface roughness through AFM. The step height and the RMS are found to be high for the film at 500nm in comparison with thickness of 200nm. The influence of the dielectric properties of the porous BFO at different thicknesses is studied using LCRQ meter. Finally, the magnetic behavior of film is compared with M–H hysteresis loop and Magnetoresistance (MR) studies.","William, R.V.;Marikani, A.;Madhavan, D.",2016-05-01,Ceramics International,"Rhombohedral structure,Porous,Root mean square (RMS),Vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM),Magnetoresistance (MR)",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.01.058,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.01.058
"Novel-structured plasma-sprayed thermal barrier coatings with low thermal conductivity, high sintering resistance and high durability","The microstructure of the ceramic topcoat has a great influence on the service performance of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). In this study, conventional layered-structure TBCs, nanostructured TBCs, and novel-structured TBCs with a unique microstructure were fabricated by air plasma spraying. The relationship between the microstructure and properties of the three different TBCs was analysed. Their thermal insulation ability, sintering resistance, and durability were systematically evaluated. Additionally, their failure modes after being subjected to two kinds of thermal shock tests were analysed. The results revealed that the novel-structured TBCs had remarkably superior performances in all the examined aspects. The thermal conductivity of the novel-structured TBCs was significantly lower than those of the conventional and nanostructured TBCs both in the as-sprayed state and after thermal treatment for 500 h at 1100 °C. The macroscopic elastic modulus of the novel-structured TBCs after sintering at 1300 °C for 100 h was similar to those of the conventional and nanostructured TBCs in the as-sprayed state. During both a burner rig thermal shock test and a furnace cyclic oxidation test, the thermal shock lifetime of the novel-structured TBCs was much longer than those of the conventional and nanostructured TBCs. This study has demonstrated novel-structured plasma-sprayed TBCs with high thermal insulation ability and high durability.","Huang, Ji Bo;Wang, Wei Ze;Li, Yuan Jun;Fang, Huan Jie;Ye, Dong Dong;Zhang, Xian Cheng;Tu, Shan Tung",2020-10-14,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,Plasma spraying,Microstructure,Thermal conductivity,Sintering,Durability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.093,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.093
Engineering zirconia coating microstructures by using saccharides in aqueous suspension plasma spraying feedstocks,"This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility to develop columnar microstructures in zirconia coatings manufactured by suspension plasma spray, through the modification of the properties of the suspension feedstocks with different common monosaccharides: fructose, ribose and glucosamine. The research also pretends to relate the properties of the suspensions to the final coatings. For the study, the saccharides suspensions were characterised in terms of physical and rheological properties. Then, highly concentrated suspensions containing the saccharides were plasma sprayed under the same spraying conditions. The experimental study with optic and scanning electron microscopy was used to evaluate the microstructure of the coatings and their characteristics, while the confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) was used to carry out a precise study of the surface topography. Results showed that saccharides produce a strong influence on the proliferation of columnar structures in the coating cross-section visible as cluster (cauliflower-like) structures on the surface. This effect is due to the diminution of water surface tension as well as an extra energy input during combustion of the saccharides. CLSM has allowed a detailed examination of the topography of the coatings to clearly quantify the differences observed in relation to the development of columnar microstructure.","Carnicer, V.;Orts, M.J.;Moreno, R.;Sánchez, E.",2020-10-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Saccharides,Columnar microstructure,Suspension feedstock properties,Suspension plasma spray",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.149,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.149
Investigation on spin coated LLTO thin film nano-electrolytes for rechargeable lithium ion batteries,"An attempt has been made to prepare Li0.5La0.5TiO3 (LLTO) nano crystalline thin films on glass substrates by spin coating. Achievement of homogeneous thin films of LLTO without noticeable pinholes and cracks, with uniform morphology is a challenge and has been an impediment in the development of all solid state batteries which is addressed in the present work. The prepared uniform films calcined at 550 °C for 5–20 - and 40h, have been subjected to structural (XRD), optical (FTIR), morphological (SEM) and electrical (AC impedance) characterization. Complete phase transformation has been ensured by optimizing the duration of calcination of the films at 550 °C for 40h. Homogeneous films with uniform morphology, without any cracks and pin holes have been obtained on calcination at 550 °C for 40h. The overall ionic conductivity of the sample is obtained as 3.52×10−7 Scm−1 for the film calcined over 40h.","Abhilash, K.P.;Sivaraj, P.;Selvin, P.Christopher;Nalini, B.;Somasundaram, K.",2015-12-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Water vapour corrosion of rare earth monosilicates for environmental barrier coating application,"Water vapour corrosion resistance of five rare earth monosilicates Y2SiO5, Gd2SiO5, Er2SiO5, Yb2SiO5, and Lu2SiO5 was investigated during testing at 1350°C for up to 166h in static air with 90% water vapour. Four of the RE-silicates showed little weight gain (0.859mgcm−2) after 166h of exposure. Prior to testing the microstructure consists of equiaxed grains of 4- 7±0.4µm. XRD analysis showed that after 50h exposure to water vapour corrosion Y, Er, Yb and Lu-silicates had both mono and disilicates present on their surfaces as a result of the reaction between monosilicate and water vapour to form disilicate, while Gd-silicate has converted completely to G4.67Si3O13 making it less stable for environmental barrier coating application. The microstructures of corroded Y, Er, Yb and Lu-silicates contain ridges and cracks, while that of Gd-silicate contains rounded grains suggesting melting along with striped contract grains.","Al Nasiri, N.;Patra, N.;Jayaseelan, D.D.;Lee, W.E.",2017-07-31,Ceramics International,"Rare earth monosilicates,Environmental barrier coating,Water vapour resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.02.123,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.02.123
"Effect of mixed solvent on structural, morphological, and optoelectrical properties of spin-coated TiO2 thin films","Nanocrystalline TiO2 anatase thin films have been synthesized from alkoxide solution via sol–gel spin coating method. The effects of different solvents of methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, and tert-butanol as well as those of mixed solvents on crystal structure, thermal behavior, morphology, and optoelectrical properties were investigated. It was found that not only the occurrence of rutile with anatase phase was solvent dependent, but also the morphology and optoelectrical properties of the films were strongly affected by solvent type. However, using two different types of alcohols as a single solvent brings the advantages of both solvents. Also, some unique properties in mixed solvent samples could be achieved. The viscosity, gel time, boiling point, possible complexes, dipole moment, and chain length of the solvent affect the packing density, lattice distortion, interfaces, thickness, optical band gap, refractive index, and extinction coefficient.","Golobostanfard, Mohammad Reza;Abdizadeh, Hossein",2012-09-30,Ceramics International,"TiO2,Sol–gel processes,Films,Optical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.04.034,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.04.034
Influence of some precursors on the physico-chemical characteristics of transition aluminas for the preparation of ceramic catalytic filters,"This work deals with the development of a new type of product, a catalytic filter, which could be used for treating flue gases, coupling particulate filtration and catalytic abatement of noxious gases. The first step of this project concerned the coating of the pore walls of a ceramic candle filter (made of α Al2O3) with a high specific surface area phase (i.e. a transition alumina). This layer will act as a catalyst support. The coating was obtained by impregnation of the porous support and subsequent calcination, using three different precursors. An alumina sol (A), an aluminium nitrate solution (B) and an urea + aluminium nitrate solution (C) were compared as regards the thermal stability and surface characteristics of the transition aluminas produced. The transition aluminas were investigated in the operation temperature range which can be of potential interest for the foreseen application (400 °–800 °C). Both physico-chemical and surface characterization results indicated precursors A and C as the most promising. Preliminary coating tests have demonstrated the feasibility of a continuous, homogeneously distributed layer of transition alumina on the pore walls of the support, enabling further development of the manufacture by deposition of specific catalytic principles.","Montanaro, Laura;Saracco, Guido",1995-12-31,Ceramics International, ,10.1016/0272-8842(95)93270-D,https://doi.org/10.1016/0272-8842(95)93270-D
High-temperature shrinkage suppression in refractory ceramic fiber board using novel surface coating agent,"Refractory ceramic fiber (RCF) boards are widely used because their insulating properties allow them to reduce energy consumption during high-temperature industrial processes. However, since conventional RCF boards undergo a linear shrinkage of more than 3% above 1300 °C, furnace lining parts, such as the ceiling, wall, and bottom made of RCF board easily become fragile. In order to suppress the shrinkage of the RCF board above 1300 °C, the RCF board surface was coated with a silica sol containing several types of alumina particles. When a RCF board coated with a silica sol slurry containing 50 mass% alumina platelets was heated at 1400 °C for 8 h, the linear shrinkage of the RCF board decreased from 4.3% to 1.5%. This, in turn, improved the heat resistance of the RCF board up to 1400 °C.","Takahashi, Naoya;Hashimoto, Shinobu;Daiko, Yusuke;Honda, Sawao;Iwamoto, Yuji",2018-10-01,Ceramics International,"Refractory,Ceramic fiber,Shrinkage,Coating,Compressive strength",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.100,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.100
Surface metallization of Cu/Ni/Au coatings on diamond/Cu composite materials for heat sink application,"Electroless-plating and electro-plating have been used to deposit Cu-Ni-Au coating on diamond/Cu composites. Before electroless copper plating, pretreatment should be applied to the surface of composites by means of boiled HNO3 etching, sensitization with SnCl2 and activation with PdCl2. The influence of pre-treatment on the electroless copper plating and electroplating Ni/Au is studied in this paper. Scanning electronic microscope, energy dispersive spectroscopy and optical microscope are used to examine microstructure and morphologies of coatings. Results indicated that the uniform and tight bonded Cu/Ni/Au coating have been successfully deposited on the diamond/Cu composites. Meanwhile, high temperature baking, solder wetting and the polarization curve tests are used to evaluate the adhesion strength, solderability and corrosion resistance of Cu/Ni/Au coatings in detail. Investigated results indicated that diamond/Cu covered with Cu-Ni-Au coatings exhibited excellent solderability and mechanical properties.","Liu, D.G.;Mai, Y.J.;Sun, J.;Luan, Z.J.;Shi, W.C.;Luo, L.M.;Li, H.;Wu, Y.C.",2017-11-30,Ceramics International,"Diamond/Cu,Solderability,Electroless plating,Surface,Electro-plating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.005
Corrosion resistance and photocatalytic activity evaluation of electrophoretically deposited TiO2-rGO nanocomposite on 316L stainless steel substrate,"TiO2-rGO nanocomposite coatings were obtained by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique of TiO2 nanoparticles and graphene oxide (GO) on stainless steel substrate. First, GO particles were synthesized using a modified Hummers' method. GO was reduced electrochemically to form a coating in the presence of nano-sized TiO2 particles. The influences of different parameters such as GO concentration, coupling co-electro-deposition parameters (electrophoretic duration and voltage) on thickness, surface morphology and, corrosion behavior of the as-synthesized TiO2-rGO nanocomposite coatings were systematically surveyed. The morphology and microstructure were investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Raman spectra and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was harnessed to evaluate the topography of the as-prepared GO powder. The bonding characteristics of as-synthesized and as-reduced GO were examined after deposition, by Energy Dispersive Analysis of X-Ray (EDX) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Corrosion behavior of coatings and that of the pure TiO2 layer were evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and polarization techniques (by applying potentiodynamic polarization spectroscopy (PDS)). Detailed SEM studies showed that increasing EPD voltage brings about a coating with increased porosity and microcracks with higher thickness. In addition to that, the presence of rGO reduced corrosion current density (i corr) and shifted corrosion potential (E corr) toward more noble values in 3.5% NaCl at room temperature. Also, Analyses revealed that the optimum electrophoretically synthesized coating was obtained at GO concentration of 1 g/L, 30 V and 30 min at room temperature. The corrosion current density of the corresponding coating was remediated up to 0.2 μA cm−2, which means an anti-corrosion ability of about 30 times compared to TiO2-coated and bare 316L stainless steel. The results of impedance spectroscopic studies demonstrated that this coating renders as a barrier layer and resistance increased from 2.95 KΩ cm2 for TiO2-coated layer to 10.49 KΩ cm2 for the optimized layer.","Azadeh, Maryam;Parvizy, Sahar;Afshar, Abdollah",2019-08-01,Ceramics International,"Nanocomposites,Corrosion,Wear resistance,TiO2",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.071,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.071
Optimized TiO2 blocking layer for dye-sensitized solar cells,"A thin compact layer of TiO2 deposited on the conductive transparent substrate of a dye-sensitized solar cell photoanode, (blocking layer, BL) can enhance the performances of the entire device. In this paper, an optimized spin coating process using an alcoholic TiCl4 solution was developed and correlated to the final properties of the layer. The physicochemical characteristics of the precursor solution and the spin coating parameters were optimised to obtain a uniform layer. XRD, FE-SEM, UV–Vis spectroscopy, AFM, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used to evaluate the influence of the number of deposition cycles on the TiO2 layer. The results were compared with those obtained using a conventional dip coating technique, showing that the newly developed spin coating process produces blocking layers with superior properties. Finally, analyses of the photovoltaic performances of the complete cell confirmed that an optimized blocking layer can lead to an improvement of the solar conversion efficiency of about 84%.","Sangiorgi, Alex;Bendoni, Riccardo;Sangiorgi, Nicola;Sanson, Alessandra;Ballarin, Barbara",2014-08-31,Ceramics International,"Dye-sensitized solar cells,Blocking layer,Spin coating,Recombination",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.03.060,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.03.060
"A simple, low cost, and template-free method for synthesis of boron nitride using different precursors","In this research, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) was synthesized using a simple, low cost, and template-free method with urea-boric acid (UB), melamine-boric acid (MB), and melamine-urea and boric acid (MUB) precursors, followed by the pyrolysis and heat treatment in a nitrogen atmosphere at 1050 °C. Samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman Spectroscopy, Fourier transform IR (FT-IR), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) techniques. The specific surface areas obtained for h-BN synthesized by UB, MB, and MUB precursors were 87.43, 573.07, and 1005.7 m2/g, respectively. The average diameters of the pores using the Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda (BJH) model were 37.78, 3.68, and 2.13 nm, respectively. A thermogravimetric analysis showed a wider range of decomposition temperatures after using three precursors for synthesizing h-BN. Crumpled, whisker, and flower-like morphologies for UB, MB, and MUB precursors were respectively found using FESEM investigations. The formation of h-BN within the MUB sample was confirmed using the XPS analysis with measured peaks of 398.5 and 190.6 eV belonging to N 1s and B 1s, respectively. Raman spectroscopy revealed a high-intensity peak in 1366 cm−1 related to the E2g mode for h-BN synthesized with MUB. Therefore, the results demonstrate that the employed method can increase the potential of using the h-BN porous powder with a high specific surface area as a lubricant, thermal insulation filler, anti-corrosion filler in paint coatings, adsorption of various gas and hydrocarbon molecules as well as its application in drug-delivery nanocarriers.","Mirzaee, Majid;Rashidi, Alimorad;Zolriasatein, Ashkan;Rezaei Abadchi, Majid",2020-10-25,Ceramics International,"Boron nitride,Urea,Melamine,Boric acid",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.171,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.171
Thermal cyclic life and failure mechanism of nanostructured 13wt%Al2O3 doped YSZ coating prepared by atmospheric plasma spraying,Nanostructured 13wt%Al2O3 doped nanostructured 8wt% yttria stabilized zirconia (nano-13AlYSZ) coatings were deposited by atmospheric plasma spray (APS). The isothermal oxidation and thermal cyclic life of the nano-13AlYSZ coating at 1100°C were investigated. The isothermal oxidation test results indicate that the oxidation kinetics of nano-13AlYSZ follows a parabolic law. The parabolic rate constant at 1100°C is calculated 0.04365mg2 cm−4 h−1. The thermal cyclic life of nano-13AlYSZ coating is about 953 times at 1100°C. The failure of the nano-13AlYSZ coating occurs at the interface between the nano-13AlYSZ coating and the thermal growth oxide (TGO).

The effect of benzotriazole gradual change on the corrosion performance of nanocomposite multilayer self-healing coating based on Titania-Alumina-Benzotriazole on AA7075,"Today, lots of coatings are being used for protection against the corrosion; however, if a crack or scratch damage the coated surface, it could not protect itself. Nano-structured titanium oxide coatings have oxidation and corrosion resistance. Also, aluminum oxide coatings are widely used because of wear and corrosion resistance. In the present study, a combination of Titania and alumina and benzotriazole (C6H5N3) as an inhibitor was synthesized to create a corrosion resistant coating with self-healing properties via Sol-gel method. The gradual change in the amount of benzotriazole in layers produced different corrosion behaviors in the coatings. Microstructural and morphological behaviors of the coatings were characterized by Grazing Incidence X-ray Diffraction (GIXRD) analysis, Raman Spectroscopy, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) and Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), respectively. According to GIXRD results, the structure of the formed coatings was utterly amorphous. FESEM images showed that the coatings were homogeneously formed in all specimens and achieving the nanostructured coatings with uniform distribution of grains depends on the optimal amount of Benzotriazole. According to AFM results, the thickness of all coatings was less than 200 nm. Raman spectroscopy results identified the chemical bond types such as Ti–O–Ti, Ti–O, and O–C–C groups. The corrosion behavior and self-healing properties of hybrid ceramic coating were investigated by electrochemical measurements, including Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and polarization test in the solution of 3.5 wt % NaCl in different periods. The results showed that benzotriazole could prevent corrosion progression due to self-healing capabilities and improve the corrosion resistance of the uncoated sample about 130 times after immersion for 96 h.","Farahani, M.;Yousefnia, H.;Seyedraoufi, Z.S.;Shajari, Y.",2019-09-30,Ceramics International,"Self-healing multi-layer coating,Nanocomposite coating,AA7075,Benzotriazole",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.197,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.197
Hydroxyapatite coating containing multi-walled carbon nanotubes on AZ31 magnesium: Mechanical-electrochemical degradation in a physiological environment,"To control the degradation of magnesium alloys and improve the mechanical performance of common hydroxyapatite (HAp) coatings, a HAp coating containing multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) was applied on AZ31 magnesium alloy using plasma spray technique. The coating properties including thickness and morphology, phase analysis and toughness were characterized through SEM, XRD, and indentation methods, respectively. Biodegradation behavior in the presence and absence of slow strain rate test (SSRT) was then thoroughly examined in a simulated body fluid (SBF). The results demonstrated that the stress corrosion cracking (SCC) susceptibility of AZ31 Mg alloy is decreased from 26.8% (HAp coated sample) to 9.8% (HAp/MWCNTs coated one). The combination of microscopic observations as well as mechanical-electrochemical degradation data for long exposure times, suggests that the bridging effect of MWCNTs among molten HAp splats plays a key role in the improvement of mechanical properties and consequently both electrochemical and stress corrosion performances of HAp coating.","Mohajernia, Shiva;Pour-Ali, Sadegh;Hejazi, Seyedsina;Saremi, Mohsen;Kiani-Rashid, Ali-Reza",2018-05-31,Ceramics International,"AZ31 magnesium alloy,Hydroxyapatite coating,Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs),Slow strain rate test (SSRT)",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.015
Comparison of solid state and sol–gel derived calcium aluminate coated graphite and characterization of prepared refractory composite,"This paper entails an extended investigation on sol–gel thin film of calcium aluminate (CaAl2O4) over graphite flakes that improved their oxidation resistance and water wettability. The commercial preparation of calcium aluminate has been compared with the sol–gel synthesis by differential thermal analysis (DTA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to assess the feasibility of the latter for coating preparation. Poorly crystalline nanostructured Ca-doped γ-Al2O3 is considered to be an important intermediate for this preparation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) of the calcined gel have been carried out to ascertain its composition. Quantitative chemical analysis of sol gel derived calcium aluminate was also estimated. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been conducted to ensure the evolution of hydrophilic nanosized cementitious phases on graphite. Zeta potential values of coated and uncoated graphites with increasing pH have also been determined to distinguish between their compatibility in a refractory castable matrix. Improved physical properties of that high alumina castable containing coated graphite, e.g. apparent porosity (AP), bulk density (BD), cold crushing strength (CCS) have been measured to evaluate the refractory quality.

Hydrothermal assisted synthesis and hot-corrosion resistance of nano lanthanum zirconate particles,"The nano La2Zr2O7 (LZ) particles with pyrochlore microstructure were successfully synthesized from a mixture of La(NO3)3, Zr(NO3)4 and C19H42BrN (CTAB) using hydrothermal assisted (HTA) synthesis which consists of two steps: hydrothermal treatment and calcination. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy were employed to study morphologies and phase compositions. The results suggest that HTA process led to very rapid synthesis of nano LZ compared to the conventional solid reaction process. The particles produced by HTA synthesis have cubic shape and the distribution of its grain size is from 10nm to 30nm. The present work demonstrates that the nano La2Zr2O7 produced via HTA synthesis which have better hot-corrosion resistance is an ideal material for thermal barrier coatings.","Wang, Chaohui;Wang, You;Wang, Liang;Sun, Xiaoguang;Yang, Changlong;Zou, Zhiwei;Li, Xuewei",2014-04-30,Ceramics International,"Hydrothermal assisted synthesis,La2Zr2O7,Nanoparticle,Hot corrosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.08.048,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.08.048
Comparative study of TiAlN coatings deposited by different high-ionization physical vapor deposition techniques,"In physical vapor deposition (PVD), the energy and incident angle of ions can be adjusted easily by applying an electromagnetic field so that coatings with different structures and properties can be produced. In this work, several high-ionization coating techniques are employed to deposit TiAlN coatings to compare the effectiveness of each technique and resulting coating properties. The continuous high-power magnetron sputtering (C-HPMS) technique shows advantages in the deposition rate and coating performance. In addition, a deposition rate of 400 nm/min is achieved by C-HPMS, whereas those of high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) and arc ion plating (AIP) are 85 nm/min and 225 nm/min, respectively. The coating also shows a particle-free and dense morphology with a smaller surface roughness of 22.4 nm. Owing to efficient ionization, the TiAlN coating deposited by C-HPMS has a high hardness of 33.2 GPa which is comparable to those prepared by AIP and HiPIMS but with small residual stress. The results provide valuable information on how to choose the proper techniques and parameters to produce coatings with the desirable adhesion strength, tribological properties, as well as corrosion resistance.","Liu, Liangliang;Tang, Wei;Zhou, Lin;Wu, Zhongcan;Ruan, Qingdong;Li, Xiaoyuan;Qasim, Abdul Mateen;Cui, Suihan;Li, Tijun;Fu, Ricky K.Y.;Tian, Xiubo;Wu, Zhongzhen;Chu, Paul K.",2020-06-01,Ceramics International,"C-HPMS,TiAlN,High ionization,Coating performance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.092,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.092
Microstructure and ablation property of gradient ZrCSiC modified C/C composites prepared by chemical liquid vapor deposition,"Chemical liquid vapor deposition was adopted to fabricate gradient ZrCSiC modified C/C composites, and the microstructure and ablation resistance were studied. Results displayed the content of SiC decreased from the composites edge to the center but that of ZrC increased, indicating SiC and ZrC ceramics have the gradient distribution in the composites. The gradient composites possessed a low CTE and high thermal conductivity. The low CTE restricted the formation and expansion of defects, which could slow the oxygen diffusion in the composites. The high thermal conductivity could transfer the heat quickly in ablation process, which reduced the heat accumulation on the ablation surface and weakened the thermal erosion. Therefore, the gradient composites possessed an outstanding anti-ablation property at two heat fluxes. Compared with the uniformed distribution composites, the linear and mass ablation rates of the gradient composites decreased by 60.9% and 66.7% at heat flux of 2.38 MW/m2 and decreased by 55.9% and 67.2% at heat flux of 4.18 MW/m2. Because of the gradient distribution, porous ZrO2 coating, ZrO2 SiO2 coating and SiO2 coating with SiO2 nanowires were generated on the ablation center, ablation transition zone and ablation edge, respectively. These coatings isolated the sample surface from the flame and inhibited the transport of oxygen into the sample inner.","He, Qinchuan;Li, Hejun;Wang, Changcong;Li, Tao;Lu, Jinhua",2019-07-31,Ceramics International,"Chemical liquid vapor deposition,C/C-ZrC-SiC composites,Gradient structure,Microstructure,Ablation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.018
Formation of Al2O3–Nb2O5 composite oxide films on low-voltage etched aluminum foil by complexation–precipitation and anodizing,"Niobium pentaoxide (Nb2O5) thin films were deposited on etched aluminum foils by complexation–precipitation followed by heat treatment. Then the Al2O3–Nb2O5 (Al–Nb) composite oxide films were formed by anodizing to increase the capacitance of anodized aluminum foils which are used in aluminum electrolytic capacitors. The composition and structure of niobium deposition layer were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the microstructures and dielectric properties of anodic oxide films were investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) respectively. The results show that the niobium deposition layer after heat treatment existed in the form of crystalline Nb2O5. The aluminum foil with Nb2O5 coating can be anodized with higher efficiency and energy saving. Compared with that of normal anodized aluminum foils, the effective area of the anodized aluminum foils with Al–Nb composite oxide films had no apparent change. The specimens with Al–Nb composite oxide films anodized at 30V exhibited about 20% higher specific capacitance than that of those with pure aluminum oxide films. It suggests that the method of complexation–precipitation is an effective way to increase the specific capacitance of anodized aluminum foils used in aluminum electrolytic capacitors.","Feng, Zhe-Sheng;Chen, Jin-Ju;Zhang, Rui;Zhao, Ning",2012-05-31,Ceramics International,"Aluminum foil,Al–Nb composite oxide film,Complexation–precipitation,Anodizing",10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.12.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.12.003
Testing method to assess lifetime of EB-PVD thermal barrier coatings on tubular specimens in static and cyclic oxidation tests,A testing methodology is presented to assess the delamination failure of an yttria stabilized zirconia electron beam physical vapor deposited (EB-PVD) top-coat as studied for tubular specimens applying short thermal cycles with high heating and cooling rates as well as for oxidation tests at constant temperature. The influence of maximum temperature and specimen diameter were investigated. Higher maximum temperatures as well as a smaller specimen diameter resulted in shorter lifetimes. No significant difference was observed between the static and cyclic oxidation tests. The failure relevant time at elevated temperatures is correlated with the thickness of the thermally growing oxide (TGO) scale developing on the bond coat. The experimental results can be described using a residual stress based analytical approach. In the model the lifetime is assumed to be terminated when a critical stress is reached.,"Steinbrech, R.W.;Postolenko, V.;Mönch, J.;Malzbender, J.;Singheiser, L.",2011-01-31,Ceramics International,"Mechanical testing,Delamination,Lifetime,Fracture,Thermal cycling,Thermal barrier coatings (TBC)",10.1016/j.ceramint.2010.09.028,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2010.09.028
Efficiency of ceramic absorber coatings for solar-thermal conversion,"Local solar constants both at 1750 m altitude and at sea level were measured by a simple and cheap, but practical water calorimetric technique, and its reliability has been proved.

Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of nanohydroxyapatite - nanosilver coatings on Ti13Zr13Nb alloy,"Titanium and its alloys are the biomaterials most frequently used in medical engineering, especially as parts of orthopedic and dental implants. The surfaces of titanium and its alloys are usually modified to improve their biocompatibility and bioactivity, for example, in connection with the deposition of hydroxyapatite coatings. The objective of the present research was to elaborate the technology of electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of nanohydroxyapatite (nanoHAp) coatings decorated with silver nanoparticles (nanoAg) and to investigate the mechanical and chemical properties of these coatings as determined by EPD voltage and the presence of nanoAg. The deposition of nanoHAp was carried out at two voltage values, 15 and 30 V. The decoration of nanoHAp coatings with nanoAg was carried out using the EPD process at a voltage value of 60 V and a deposition time of 5min. The thickness of the undecorated coatings was found to be 2.16 and 5.14µm for applied EPD voltages of 15- and 30-V, respectively. The release rate of silver nanoparticles into an artificial saliva solution increased with exposure time and EPD voltage. The corrosion current, between 1 and 10nA/cm2, was significantly higher for undecorated nanoHAp coatings and close to that of the substrate for decorated nanoHAp coatings. The hardness of the undecorated nanoHAp coatings obtained at 15 and 30 V of EPD voltage attained 0.2245±0.036 and 0.0661±0.008GPa, respectively. Resistance to nanoscratching was higher for thicker coatings. The wettability angle was lower for coatings decorated with nanoAg.","Bartmanski, Michal;Cieslik, Bartlomiej;Glodowska, Joanna;Kalka, Pamela;Pawlowski, Lukasz;Pieper, Maja;Zielinski, Andrzej",2017-10-15,Ceramics International,"Apatite D,Biomedical applications E,Films A,Nanocomposites B",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.026,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.026
"A study of the structural and morphological properties of Ni–ferrite, Zn–ferrite and Ni–Zn–ferrites functionalized with starch","Zinc–ferrite, nickel–ferrite and mixed nickel–zinc ferrites were successfully synthesized via the thermal decomposition method from acetylacetonate complexes. To control the particle size and enhance dispersibility in an aqueous medium, starch, a natural and biocompatible compound, was used for the first time for coating such magnetic powders. X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) was performed to study the structural properties of all samples. The presence of a single-phase spinel structure as well as the cation distribution in both sites of all investigated magnetic powders was confirmed. The values of unit cell parameters obtained from the results of the Rietveld analysis decreased, while the average crystallite size increased with increasing Ni2+ content. The average microstrain parameters unambiguously showed a change in the spinel structure with cation distribution. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses were also utilized to characterize the synthesized materials, corroborating the XRPD data. The obtained results indicated that functionalization by starch was successfully achieved.","Andjelković, Ljubica;Šuljagić, Marija;Lakić, Mladen;Jeremić, Dejan;Vulić, Predrag;Nikolić, Aleksandar S.",2018-08-15,Ceramics International,"Ferrites,Powders,Solid state reaction,Functionalization,Structural properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.018
Biocompatibility and drug delivery efficiency of PEG-b-PCL/hydroxyapatite bilayer coatings on Nitinol superelastic alloy,"A bioactive surface on metallic implants and the capability of drug delivery could promote successful implantation. In this work, biological behavior and drug delivery efficiency of hydroxyapatite (HA)/poly ε-caprolactone–polyethylene glycol (PEG-b-PCL) bilayer composite coatings on NiTi alloy were investigated. Scanning electron microscopy images revealed that the electrodeposited HA coating had a dense inner layer and a porous outer layer. It was shown that the polymer can penetrate into the porosities of the HA and increase the water contact angle of the surface. According to the cell culture results, HA/PEG-b-PCL (0.3 mg cm-2) coating exhibited the best bioactivity as compared to the HA and other composite coatings with a higher amount of the copolymer. This bilayer coating also showed the best results based on the nano-scratch test results. Ibuprofen was effectively loaded on the HA/PEG-b-PCL (0.3 mg cm-2) film and released into phosphate-buffered saline up to 90% during 20 h. It seems that ibuprofen is released by the copolymer hydration and the bioactive surface of HA appears gradually to support the cells growth.","Etminanfar, M.R.;Sheykholeslami, S.O.R.;Khalili, V.;Mahdavi, S.",2020-06-01,Ceramics International,"Hydroxyapatite,PEG-b-PCL,Nano-scratch,Bilayer coating,Drug delivery",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.038,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.038
Preparation and properties of TiAlN coatings on silicon nitride ceramic cutting tools,"In this study, a PVD-based multi-arc ion plating technique was employed to prepare TiAlN coatings on the surface of commercial silicon nitride cutting tools. The effects of different bias voltages on the microstructure, mechanical properties, cutting performance, and wear mechanisms of the TiAlN-coated silicon nitride cutting tools were investigated. Increasing the negative bias voltage gradually decreased the number of large particles on the surface of the TiAlN coating and improved its structure. The coating thickness increased with increasing bias voltage up to a maximum value and then decreased. The hardness of the TiAlN-coated silicon nitride ceramic cutting tools increased monotonously from 2260 ± 50 to 2681 ± 75 HV0.05 with increasing bias voltage. The adhesive force between the coating and the substrate also increased initially with increasing bias voltage before decreasing. The sample prepared at a bias voltage of −100V resulted in a maximum adhesive force of 63N and showed the best cutting performance of all tools prepared in this work, with a cutting length of 1500m. Different wear mechanisms were observed for cutting tools prepared at different bias voltages; abrasive wear was dominant for samples prepared at −50V, while both adhesive and abrasive wear were observed for the three tools prepared using bias voltages between −100V and −200V.","Liu, Wei;Chu, Quanquan;He, Rongxuan;Huang, Meipeng;Wu, Haidong;Jiang, Qiangguo;Chen, Jian;Deng, Xin;Wu, Shanghua",2018-02-01,Ceramics International,"Physical vapor deposition,B.

Fiber strength measurement for KD-I(f)/SiC composites and correlation to tensile mechanical behavior at room and elevated temperatures,"Mechanical properties of KD-I-fiber-reinforced silicon carbide matrix composites were evaluated under monotonic tension at room and elevated temperatures. The measured ultimate strength showed a big decline for uncoated specimens from a room temperature value of 350MPa, to 220 and 200MPa at 1100°C and 1300°C, respectively. The decrease in ultimate strength at elevated temperatures was believed to be partly due to the oxidation embrittlement and fiber strength degradation. Specimens with anti-oxidation coatings tested at 1300°C exhibited the ultimate strength of 320MPa, which was comparable to that tested at room temperature. Scanning electron microscopy was employed to evaluate the in-situ KD-I fiber strengths via fracture mirror size measurements. The analysis indicated that oxidation embrittlement was the dominated damage mechanism leading to the decrease of ultimate strength. Measured values of ultimate strengths of the CMCs were compared with predictions made on the basis of in-situ fiber strength characteristics and available model.","Xin, JING;Duoqi, SHI;Xiaoguang, YANG;Chaojun, ZHAO",2015-01-31,Ceramics International,"Ceramic matrix composites,In-situ fiber strength,Tensile strength,High temperature",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.08.072,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.08.072
CVR-SiC coating of graphite pebbles for fusion blanket application,"The Helium Cooled Ceramic Reflector (HCCR) Test Blanket Module (TBM), recently planned for installation and testing in the nuclear fusion energy project of International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), uses graphite in the form of pebbles as a neutron reflector, opening the possibility of avoiding the use of a beryllium neutron multiplier. A silicon carbide (SiC) coating should be formed on the graphite pebbles to prohibit the reaction of graphite with steam and/or air and to reinforce the surface strength. In this work, a dense β-SiC coating was formed over the surface of the graphite pebbles by a chemical vapor reaction (CVR) process of the solid–solid (SS) and vapor–solid (VS) reaction of the SiO2(s)–C(s)–SiO(v)–CO(v) system. The microstructural features, XRD patterns, pore size distribution, porosity and oxidation behavior of the SiC-coated graphite pebbles were investigated. A SiC coating with a thickness of approximately 30μm remarkably improved the oxidation resistance and the density of the graphite pebbles. In an isothermal oxidation test conducted at 700°C, the SiC-coated graphite pebbles showed strong oxidation resistance and a weight loss of approximately 2wt% over the course of 2h. This paper describes the major results obtained from our experiments on the CVR-SiC coating of nuclear graphite pebbles, recently conducted in the Korean HCCR TBM team of the ITER project.","Yun, Young-Hoon;Park, Yi-Hyun;Ahn, Mu-Young;Cho, Seungyon",2014-01-31,Ceramics International,"International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER),Korean Helium Cooled Ceramic Reflector (HCCR) Test Blanket Module (TBM),Neutron reflector graphite pebbles,Chemical Vapor Reaction (CVR)-SiC(Silicon Carbide) coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.06.082,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.06.082
The effect of spraying temperature on the corrosion and wear behavior of HVOF thermal sprayed WC-Co coatings,"Cobalt matrix carbides are favorite cases of wear and corrosion-resistant coatings. Among thermal spray processes the high-velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) spraying is a popular choice because of its unique properties. In this paper the effect of particles’ temperature on the porosity, corrosion as well as wear behavior of high-velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) thermally sprayed WC-12Co coating has been studied. The temperature of particles was measured using a Spray-Watch diagnostic system. Also the scanning electron microscopy (SEM), image analysis, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used for examining the powder and the coating. The corrosion potential and corrosion current density was evaluated using potentio-dynamic polarization test. Results show that the porosity is affected by thermal flow on the coating surface. Besides, a higher particle temperature resulted in achieving more amorphous phases and eventually the higher corrosion resistance. Sample A was coated with an impact temperature of 2012.4 °C. Although the porosity was higher than other sprayed samples (1.7%), the higher content of amorphous phase led to recording a higher corrosion resistance (64.3E-6A). Sample B was coated with an impact temperature of 1880 °C for which the Jcorr was 67.2E-6 A. Sample C was sprayed with a low impact temperature of 1702 °C for which a surface porosity of 1% and the low corrosion resistance of 79.5E-6A were recorded. Based on the experiments it was concluded that for the WC-12Co coating the corrosion resistant phases have the dominant influences on the corrosion resistance.","Jalali Azizpour, M.;Tolouei-Rad, M.",2019-08-01,Ceramics International,"HVOF,WC-Co,Corrosion,Porosity,Temperature,Wear",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.091,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.091
Effect of Ta2O5 addition on thermophysical and mechanical properties of (Sm0.5Gd0.3Yb0.2)2Ce2O7 compounds,"In this study, the (Sm0.5Gd0.3Yb0.2)2(Ce1−x Ta x )2O7+x oxides were obtained by high-temperature solid-state sintering. The phase lattice, micro-structure, thermal-physical and mechanical performances of samples were examined. The synthesised compounds exhibit a single fluorite-type lattice, and they also have relatively dense microscopic structures. The differences in atomic weight and ionic radius between the solute and host kations enable a reduction of thermal conductivity of bulk samples. The reduced thermal expansion coefficient and the elevated elastic modulus are ascribed to the lower ion-radius of Ta5+ compared to Ce4+. The addition of “soft” Ta2O5 reduces the micro-hardness and increases the fracture toughness. The presented results herein provide an effective approach to ameliorate the fracture toughness of ceramics for thermal barrier coatings.","Zhao, Yongtao;Zhang, Junhui;Zhang, Hongsong;Fei, Wang;Chen, Xiaoge;Yang, Xianfeng",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Ta2O5 addition,Thermophysical properties,Mechanical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.120,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.120
Microstructural evolution of plasma spray physical vapor deposited thermal barrier coatings at 1150 °C studied by impedance spectroscopy,"Plasma spray physical vapor deposition (PS-PVD) is a new promising technology for processing thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). In this study, the microstructural evolution of PS-PVD yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) TBCs at 1150 °C was investigated by scanning electron microscopy, electron backscattered diffraction, and impedance spectroscopy. Bridging is observed between the secondary columns of the coatings during the first 8 h of heat treatment, while sintering necks are observed between the quasi-columns over the heat-treatment interval of 12–20 h. As the heat-treatment time increases to 100 h, the nanogaps between the secondary columns disappear and a large number of shrinkage pores are observed in the columns, leading to a typical cellular structure. Besides, the average grain size of the YSZ coatings increases from 0.20 (as-deposited) to 0.55 µm (after 50 h of heat treatment). The resistance of the YSZ grains increases while that of the YSZ grain boundaries decreases because of grain coarsening. During the first 4 h of heat treatment, the resistance of the thermally grown oxide (TGO) scale increases because of its thickening. However, its resistance decreases during the next 4 h of heat treatment mainly because of the change in its composition (from pure alumina to mixed oxides).","Yang, Xiaolin;Wei, Liangliang;Li, Jimeng;Zhang, Baopeng;Wang, Shixing;Guo, Hongbo",2018-06-15,Ceramics International,"Plasma spray physical vapor deposition,Thermal barrier coatings,Yttria-stabilized zirconia,Impedance spectroscopy,Microstructural evolution,Electrical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.120,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.120
Microstructure characteristics and oxidation behavior of vacuum plasma sprayed tungsten disilicide coating,"An efficient and effective method, vacuum plasma spray, has been utilized to fabricate tungsten disilicide coating in the present work. The phase composition and microstructure characteristics of the as-sprayed coating have been focused as well as its thermal stability and oxidation behavior from room temperature to 1500°C. Results showed that the coating consisted of tetragonal WSi2 and a little amount of tetragonal W5Si3, presenting a uniform and lamellar structure with porosity less than 6%. The WSi2 coating was stable at temperatures below 500°C, while rapid oxidization occurred between 800 and 1200°C leaving loose and coarse surface consisting of mixed SiO2 and WO3. Excellent oxidation resistance at temperature range of 1300–1500°C could be observed with dense and integrated SiO2 film formed on the coating surface. The oxidation mechanism was also discussed based on theoretical analysis, which could provide strong illustration of the oxidation processes of the WSi2 coating at different temperatures.","Zhai, Cuihong;Niu, Yaran;Huang, Liping;Pan, Houhua;Li, Hong;Zheng, Xuebin;Sun, Jinliang",2016-12-31,Ceramics International,"WSi2 coating,Vacuum plasma spray,Microstructure,Oxidation behavior",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.09.024,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.09.024
Design of an inlaid interface structure to improve the oxidation protective ability of SiC–MoSi2–ZrB2 coating for C/C composites,"To improve the oxidation protective ability of SiC–MoSi2–ZrB2 coating for carbon/carbon (C/C) composites, pre-oxidation treatment and pack cementation were applied to construct a buffer interface layer between C/C substrate and SiC–MoSi2–ZrB2 coating. The tensile strength increased from 2.29 to 3.35MPa after pre-oxidation treatment, and the mass loss was only 1.91% after oxidation at 1500°C for 30h. Compared with the coated C/C composites without pre-oxidation treatment, after 18 thermal cycles from 1500°C and room temperature, the mass loss was decreased by 30.6%. The improvements of oxidation resistance and mechanical property are primarily attributed to the formation of inlaid interface between the C/C substrate and SiC–MoSi2–ZrB2 coating.","Fu, Qian-Gang;Jing, Jun-Yi;Li, He-Jun;Jin, Xiu-Xiu;Zhuang, Lei;Li, Lu",2016-02-15,Ceramics International,"C.

Fracture mechanics analysis of delamination buckling of a porous ceramic foam coating from elastic substrates,"Ceramic foams are ideal materials for thermal protection systems such as those used as a thermal shield on the space shuttle. The working temperature difference between the outer and inner surfaces of the ceramic foam is extremely high. Under this adverse condition, the ceramic foam coating could buckle from its underneath structures. Therefore, the general problem of damage due to buckling delamination of a ceramic coating on an elastic substrate is investigated in this paper. The delamination buckling amplitude and the stress intensity factor at the tip of buckling region are derived in closed form in terms of the porosity of the ceramic foam. Based on the maximum amplitude and the critical stress intensity factor criteria, critical temperatures of coating buckling from the substrate are established. A fitting formula of maximum buckling amplitude as a function of outer surface temperature is given. It is found that higher porosity and length-to-thickness ratio of the coating will result in a smaller stress intensity factor. However, it seems that the buckling amplitude is independent of the porosity of ceramic foams.","Cui, Y.J.;Wang, B.L.;Wang, K.F.;Li, J.E.",2018-10-15,Ceramics International,"Ceramic foam,Thermal shield,Delamination buckling,Stress intensity factor,Porous ceramic",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.276,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.276

Al2O3 coating on BaLi2Ti6O14 surface to boost its stability and rate performance,"BaLi2Ti6O14, a promising anode material for lithium-ion battery application, was successfully prepared by a sol-gel method. To improve the structural stability and electrochemical performance of the materials, an ionic conductive Al2O3 layer was introduced. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the particles become smaller and distribute more uniformly because of the coating, and possible mechanism was discussed. Our experiments further showed that BLTO-4 sample has the best electrochemical performance. Furthermore, excessive coating will lead to a decrease of reversible capacity, because Al2O3 has no electrochemical activity. The charge and discharge capacities of BLTO-4 are 174.9 and 175.9 mAh g−1 after 50 cycles at 0.2 C, which are much higher than those of the pure sample (107.3 and 108.4 mAh g−1). Even at 10 C, BLTO-4 still delivers a reversible specific capacity of 98.6 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles. The good cyclic stability and rate performance of BLTO-4 can be attributed to the reduced particle size and the advantages of the Al2O3 coating layer, which is favorable for the enhancement of the structural stability and the reduction of the charge transfer resistance of the materials.","Liu, Li-yan;Yu, Hai-Tao;Wang, Xiao-Dong;Guo, Chen-Feng;Zheng, Bing;Xie, Ying;Yi, Ting-Feng",2020-07-31,Ceramics International,"BaLi2Ti6O14,Al2O3 coating,Anode material,Electrochemical performance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.235,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.235
Electrophoretically deposited manganese oxide coatings for supercapacitor application,"In the present study, manganese oxide electrodes with promising pseudo-capacitive properties were prepared by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) using needle-like manganese dioxide powders. As-deposited coating exhibited a porous microstructure where the size and shape of the starting powders can be observed. The electrochemical performance of the as-deposited coating was then evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) up to 300 times. The initial specific capacitance was 236F/g which dropped to 200F/g after 25 CV tests, and decreased gradually to 190F/g thereafter. The electrochemical behaviors during EPD and CV were examined by synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy techniques from which it was deciphered that a reduction reaction from Mn4+ to Mn3+ occurred during EPD concomitant with re-oxidization during repetitive CV cycles.","Chen, Chin-Yi;Wang, Sheng-Chang;Lin, Chia-Yen;Chen, Fan-Shiong;Lin, Chung-Kwei",2009-12-31,Ceramics International,"A.

A reactive-sputter-deposited TiSiN nanocomposite coating for the protection of metallic bipolar plates in proton exchange membrane fuel cells,"To meet the needs of corrosion resistance and electrically conductivity for metallic bipolar plates that are employed in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), a TiSiN nanocomposite coating was fabricated on to a Ti–6Al–4V substrate using reactive sputter-deposition through the double cathode glow discharge plasma technique. The microstructure of the TiSiN coating comprised nanocrystallite TiN grains embedded in an amorphous Si3N4 matrix. Electrochemical measurements were employed to investigate the corrosion behavior of the TiSiN coating in the simulated operating environments of a PEMFC, specifically 0.5 M H2SO4 solution containing different HF concentrations (namely 2, 4 and 6 ppm) at 70 °C pumped with H2 at the anode and air at the cathode. With increasing HF concentration, a higher corrosion current density and lower corrosion potential were observed from both the coating and the uncoated substrate, indicating that the addition of HF accelerated their corrosion rates under these conditions. Compared to the uncoated substrate, the TiSiN coating showed a markedly higher corrosion resistance at all HF concentrations. The passive film that formed on the TiSiN coating, with a resistance of the order of magnitude of ~107 Ω cm2, displayed good electrochemical stability and was less affected by changes in HF concentration. For the TiSiN coating, the values of interfacial contact resistance (ICR) were 14.7 mΩ cm−2 and 18.3 mΩ cm−2, respectively, before and after 2.5 h potentiostatic polarization with 6 ppm HF under cathodic conditions under a compaction pressure of 140 N cm−2. Both values are much lower than those for the bare substrate. Moreover, the TiSiN coating was shown to improve the hydrophobicity of Ti–6Al–4V that would help facilitate water management in the PEMFC operating environment. This coating, which exhibited excellent corrosion resistance, electro-conductivity and hydrophobicity, is therefore a promising material for protecting metallic bipolar plates from corrosive attack.","Peng, Shuang;Xu, Jiang;Li, Zhengyang;Jiang, Shuyun;Munroe, Paul;Xie, Zong-Han;Lu, Hong",2020-02-15,Ceramics International,"Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC),Bipolar plate,Titanium alloy,TiSiN coating,Corrosion resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.263,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.263
Influence of preheating processes on the microstructure of laser glazed YSZ coatings,"Laser glazing is considered to be a promising surface sealing technique for thermal barrier coating. The dense top layer with reduced surface roughness and the segment cracks perpendicular to the surface are considered to be suitable for improving the thermal cycling and hot corrosion resistance of these kind of coatings. In present study, yttria stabilized zirconia ceramic coatings were manufactured by atmospheric plasma spraying and then subjected to a Nd-YAG pulsed laser source. During the laser glazing process, coatings were preheated to 600°C and 800°C in order to obtain different microstructure of the laser glazed coatings. The surface morphologies and cross-sections of the coatings were examined by scanning electron microscopy and microhardness measurements of coatings were carried out. The results indicate that preheating process induces a reduction of the grain size of laser glazed coatings in conjunction with an increasing of microhardness and toughness. In addition, preheating also decreases the substrate-coating interface tensile stress which leads to a reduction of crack surface density.","Wang, Yan;Darut, Geoffrey;Luo, Xiao-Tao;Poirier, Thierry;Stella, Jorge;Liao, Hanlin;Planche, Marie-Pierre",2017-04-01,Ceramics International,"Laser glazing,YSZ,Preheating,Microstructure,Tensile stress",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.125,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.125
Phase formation dynamics upon thermal explosion synthesis of magnesium diboride,"Time-resolved X-ray diffraction was used to study the dynamics of phase formation in magnesium diboride produced by self-propagating high-temperature synthesis in the thermal explosion mode. The MgB2 phase was demonstrated to emerge without the formation of intermediate compounds. The effect of the mixture heating rate on the formation mechanism of the MgB2 phase was established. The presence of oxygen impurities has a significant impact on the kinetics and formation mechanism of MgB2. If the heating rate exceeds 150°/min, the oxide coating is not formed around the magnesium particles, which results in the solid-phase reaction of Mg+2B=MgB2 through a reaction diffusion mechanism. Moreover, the self-ignition temperature of the mixture is lower than the melting point for magnesium. Mechanical activation of the mixture leads to variations in the kinetics of MgB2 formation, significantly increases the period of simultaneous existence of Mg and MgB2, and reduces the temperature at which the reaction occurs.","Kovalev, D.Yu.;Potanin, A.Yu.;Levashov, E.A.;Shkodich, N.F.",2016-02-01,Ceramics International,"Magnesium diboride,Thermal explosion,Time-resolved X-ray diffraction,Mechanical activation,Reaction diffusion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.10.078,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.10.078
"Characterization and properties of microarc oxidized coatings containing Si, Ca and Na on titanium","To form bioactive microarc oxidized (MAO) coatings on titanium, the exploration for introducing various elements into the TiO2-based MAO coatings has been continually noticed. In this work, novel MAO coatings containing Si, Ca and Na (SCN) elements were prepared on titanium. The elemental composition, mechanical properties, corrosion resistance and apatite-forming ability of TiO2-based MAO coatings containing SCN were investigated. The surface hardness, elastic modulus, elastic recovery and corrosion resistance of the MAO coatings containing SCN were improved obviously by increasing the applied voltages. And the effect of applied voltage on the wetting ability of MAO coatings containing SCN is not significant. The current results indicated that the MAO coating containing SCN possesses good apatite-forming ability. The apatite-bonding structure is highly dependent on the chemical reactivity of the materials surface in simulated body fluid.","cheng, Su;Wei, Daqing;Zhou, Yu;Guo, Haifeng",2011-08-31,Ceramics International,"C.

The properties of hydroxyapatite ceramic coatings produced by plasma electrolytic oxidation,"Calcium phosphate coatings produced on the surface of Ti6Al4V by plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) using different concentrations of hydroxyapatite (HA) in a 0.12M Na3PO4 (NAP) electrolyte solution was investigated. It was found that the amount of calcium phosphate particles infiltrated into the coating layer as well as the thickness and the surface roughness of the coating increased with increasing HA concentration. The porosity of the ceramic coatings indicated an inverse relationship with the concentration of HA particles dispersed in the NAP solution. The result also demonstrates that higher scratch adhesive strength was achieved using 1.5g/L HA solution, producing a critical load of 2099mN, while 0g/L HA only produced a critical load of 1247mN. The adhesion becomes independent of thickness when the concentration of HA exceeds 1.5g/L. The failure of the coating was characterized by large periodic hemispherical chipping, while intermittent delamination was noticed with the coating embedded with HA particles. This study demonstrate the viability of using PEO to produce a thin layer of HA ceramic coating on Ti6Al4V suitable for biomedical applications.","Adeleke, S.A.;Ramesh, S.;Bushroa, A.R.;Ching, Y.C.;Sopyan, I.;Maleque, M.A.;Krishnasamy, S.;Chandran, Hari;Misran, H.;Sutharsini, U.",2018-02-01,Ceramics International,"Plasma electrolytic oxidation,Hydroxyapatite coating,Coating characteristics",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.114,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.114
Effects of SiC coating on microwave absorption of novel three-dimensional reticulated SiC/porous carbon foam,"SiC coating had key effects on designing and optimizing electromagnetic wave absorption properties of SiC films reinforced foam composites. In this paper, ultrathin three-dimensional reticulated SiC/porous carbon foam composite (3D-SiC/PCF) was prepared eventually, followed by the successive stable treatment, carbonization stage and chemical vapor deposition process. The results showed that the complex permittivities of 3D-SiC/PCF-II were much lower than that of PCF and 3D-SiC/PCF-I. Although the attenuation constant decreased with the induction of SiC coating, the impedance matching ratio increased. Besides, 3D-SiC/PCF-II possessed a better wave absorption performance, where the minimum reflection loss was −29.74 dB. At last, the influencing mechanism of both the impedance matching ratio and the attenuation constant behind was discussed to further probe the effect of the SiC content and provide suggestions for functional applications.","Ye, Xinli;Chen, Zhaofeng;Ai, Sufen;Hou, Bin;Zhang, Junxiong;Liang, Xiaohui;Zhou, Qianbo;Liu, Hezhou;Cui, Sheng",2019-05-31,Ceramics International,"SiC,Films,Composite,Functional applications",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.186,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.186
Effects of solid lubricant and laser surface texturing on tribological behaviors of atmospheric plasma sprayed Al2O3-ZrO2 composite coatings,"Atmospheric plasma-sprayed (APS), low-friction Al2O3-ZrO2 coatings were deposited with solid lubricants, and their effects on the laser surface texturing (LST) under a lubricated condition (commercial engine oil, 5W30) were evaluated. All specimens showed a 19.6% dimple density, and the contact angle of the APS coatings after LST processing decreased by ∼19–50%. The hydrophilicity of the APS coatings improved after LST processing, and the tribological behaviors of the APS coating containing different solid lubricants were mainly observed in the abrasive grooves, spalling, microcracks, residual pores and trapped wear debris on the worn surface. The coefficient of friction for the APS coatings was affected by the solid lubricants and the LST processing. The coefficient of friction for the APS coatings (except for h-BN) when adding solid lubricants and LST processing decreased to 3.7–7.9% and 2.3–9.5%, respectively.","Kim, Seung-Ho;Jeong, Sang-Hoon;Kim, Tae-Ho;Choi, Jin-Hyuk;Cho, Sung-Hun;Kim, Bum Sung;Lee, Soo Wohn",2017-08-15,Ceramics International,"Tribological behavior,Atmospheric plasma spraying,Solid lubricants, Laser surface texturing, Composite coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.073,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.073
Hot corrosion of glass coating on nickel base superalloy,"Hot corrosion behaviour of BaO–MgO–SiO2 based glass coating on nickel base superalloy was studied using 80wt.% Na2SO4 +20wt.% NaCl salt mixture, which melts at about 700°C. In one set of experiments the glass coated superalloy substrates were immersed in the molten salt wherein in the other samples were suspended in the salt vapour at 1000°C. During the test, mass loss per unit surface area was observed to be higher for specimens suspended in the salt vapour. The phase composition and microstructure of the corroded coating were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in association with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis.","Das, S.;Datta, S.;Basu, D.;Das, G.C.",2008-07-31,Ceramics International,"B.

Influence of pressure on chemical vapor deposition of boron nitride from BCl3/NH3/H2 gas mixtures,"Boron nitride (BN) was synthesized from BCl3/NH3/H2 precursor mixtures via chemical vapor deposition, with a focus on the influence of the total partial pressure of BCl3, NH3, and H2 (p BCl3+NH3+H2) on the surface deposition rate. The surface deposition rate of BN initially increased and then decreased with increasing p BCl3+NH3+H2, implying that the deposition process transitioned from surface reaction control to mass transfer control. BN deposition from BCl3 and NH3 was mainly attributable to several intermediate gaseous products containing B, N, Cl, and H, such as Cl2BNH2, ClB(NH2)2, and B(NH2)3. The microstructures of BN coatings deposited on SiC fibers were also analyzed. The BN coatings were uniformly and evenly deposited on the SiC fiber surfaces at low p BCl3+NH3+H2 values, whereas excessive p BCl3+NH3+H2 values afforded coatings containing large grains. The as-prepared BN coatings were stoichiometric but amorphous. Heat treatment substantially improved the texture and crystallinity to afford hexagonal BN.","Wang, Mengqian;Jia, Lintao;Xu, Haiming;Li, Aijun;Peng, Yuqing;Tang, Zhepeng",2020-03-31,Ceramics International,"Boron nitride,Chemical vapor deposition,Deposition rate,Microstructure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.218,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.218
Carbon-bonded alumina foam filters produced by centrifugation: A route towards improved homogeneity,"An alternative route for producing carbon-bonded alumina filters was analyzed and compared with the state of the art, both based on the replica method. The latter comprises a dip coating and subsequent rolling and spraying steps (R+S). The proposed route is based on dip coating and centrifugation (CF-T1). Aiming to investigate the influence of an additional thermal treatment on the ceramic coating homogeneity, a modified centrifugation route was analyzed (CF-T2). Computer tomography (CT) analyses provided a targeted evaluation of the spatial material distribution after each processing step. It was found that log-normal functions fitted well the wall thickness values attained for all investigated filters. Qualitative surface evaluation was conducted using a digital (optical) microscope. The R+S and CF-T1 filters exhibited surface macro-cracks and hollow struts, due to the release of the polyurethane foam template during firing. The CF-T2 presented partly filled struts with a high amount of micro-cracks on the surface, being a potential alternative to increase the filtration efficiency, as the filter surface area was raised. However, in preliminary mechanical tests, the surface micro-cracks seemed to considerably reduce the cold crushing strength of the CF-T2 filters. Based on the CT data, it was possible to conclude that the centrifuged filters presented a more homogeneous material distribution, as a consequence of higher automation level of the process.","Luchini, B.;Hubálková, J.;Wetzig, T.;Grabenhorst, J.;Fruhstorfer, J.;Pandolfelli, V.C.;Aneziris, C.G.",2018-08-15,Ceramics International,"Carbon-bonded alumina,Ceramic filters,Computer tomography,Centrifugation,Refractory",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.228,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.228
"Fe-based amorphous soft magnetic composites with SiO2 insulation coatings: A study on coatings thickness, microstructure and magnetic properties","Core-shell structured FeSiBCCr@SiO2 amorphous soft magnetic composites (ASMCs) with tunable insulating layer thicknesses have been designed and fabricated by the powder metallurgy method. The growth process of the coatings obtained via the sol-gel method has been systematically studied based on the analysis of the growth mechanism and the insulating layer thicknesses calculated by a modified method. In the powder-coating process using small quantities of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) (0.025–0.1 mL/g), a relatively uniform insulating layer is formed on the surface of the powders. Increasing the TEOS concentration further (0.25–1 mL/g) greatly enhances the reaction kinetics of the hydrolysis and condensation reactions. Consequently, the SiO2 shells of the amorphous powder rapidly grow in thickness and also generate aggregates. The evolution of the thickness of the coatings under different growth conditions also corresponds to the variation of the magnetic performance of the ASMCs. The ASMCs with an appropriate SiO2 insulating layer exhibit stability at high frequencies and significantly lower the contribution of eddy current to the total loss. Conversely, a thick insulation layer results in a high fraction of the non-magnetic phase and consequently enhances the hysteresis loss. Thus, an enhanced magnetic performance of the FeSiBCCr ASMCs can be achieved by adjusting the TEOS concentration (0.025–0.1 mL/g) or the thickness of the SiO2 insulating layer.","Zhou, Bang;Dong, Yaqiang;Chi, Qiang;Zhang, Yiqun;Chang, Liang;Gong, Mengji;Huang, Jianjun;Pan, Yan;Wang, Xinmin",2020-06-15,Ceramics International,"Soft magnetic composites,Growth mechanism,Coating thickness,Core loss",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.128,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.128
High temperature corrosion resistant coatings for gas flare systems,"Gas flaring systems are used in processing plants to eliminate excess gases while serving as a safe pressure-relieving system. These systems are built using 310 stainless steel (SS310) thanks to its mechanical properties and performance under high temperature operating conditions. However, the findings have revealed that SS310 is susceptible to high temperature sulfidation when exposed to a corrosive environment. In the present work, SEM analysis has been conducted to investigate the causes of this type of failure. To tackle this problem, high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) thermal spraying was used to deposit a double-layer thermal barrier coatings, including a top yttria stabilized zirconia layer (TBC) and a bond coating CoNiCrAlY layer (BC) on SS310 substrates. The performance of the coatings was tested by exposing it to a high temperature corrosive environment. As a result, an improved resistance to corrosion was observed. This improved performance can be attributed to the absence of tetragonal to monoclinic phase change transformation, and to a decrease in the volume fraction of the monoclinic phase in yttria stabilized zirconia top coat, as indicated by XRD analysis.","Taie, Ihsan;Al-Shahrani, Abdullah;Qari, Nada;Fihri, Aziz;Al-Obaid, Waleed;Alabedi, Gasan",2018-04-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,High velocity oxygen fuel,Yttria stabilized zirconia,Flare tip,Corrosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.114,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.114
Cracking behaviors of EB-PVD thermal barrier coating under temperature gradient,"In this paper, we study the cracking behaviors of single-crystal nickel-based superalloy samples coated with electron-beam physical vapor deposited (EB-PVD) thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) under a thermal gradient experimentally and via the finite element method (FEM). Our results indicate that the stress distribution and failure mode of the TBC samples under the thermal gradient are different from those of samples under a uniform temperature field. The failure of the TBCs under uniform temperature is initiated by interfacial and horizontal cracks, which can result in the separation and buckling of the top coat (TC) layer. However, for the TBCs under a thermal gradient, failure is mainly caused by both vertical TC cracks and interfacial cracks because of the increased transversal stress in the TC layer. Moreover, the initiation and propagation of vertical and horizontal cracks change the failure mode to local spallation of the TC layer. We believe that our findings can contribute to further developments in TBC technology.","Shi, Duoqi;Song, Jianan;Li, Shaolin;Qi, Hongyu;Yang, Xiaoguang",2019-10-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,EB-PVD,Thermal fatigue,Thermal gradient,Crack initiation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.071,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.071
Impact of high temperature on the compression behavior of carbon-bonded alumina filters with functionalized coatings,"Carbon-bonded alumina is currently applied in metal casting processes due to its excellent thermomechanical performance. Used as ceramic foam filters in steel casting, the surface composition of such material is essential for trapping primary and secondary inclusions in liquid steel, where functionalized coatings are proven to enhance the filtration efficiency considerably. In this paper, compression tests on uncoated and coated Al2O3–C foam filters are performed at high temperatures under argon atmosphere. The macrostructure of the prepared filters before the high temperature compression tests and the microstructure afterwards are examined by computer tomography and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. High temperature compression strength of the studied filters generally exceeds cold crushing strength values thanks to plastification processes. The applied coatings have positive impact on the filter strength. The observed high scatter of the compression strength can be attributed to the inhomogeneity of strut thickness, distribution of the oxide and non-oxide materials within the struts as well as coating thickness.","Wu, Xian;Ranglack-Klemm, Yvonne;Hubálková, Jana;Solarek, Johannes;Aneziris, Christos G.;Weidner, Anja;Biermann, Horst",2020-09-28,Ceramics International,"Carbon-bonded alumina,Refractory,Ceramic foam filter,Steel casting,Compression behavior,High temperature",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.255,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.255
Influence of GO-Al2O3 hybrid material on the tribological behavior of chemically bonded ceramic coating,"GO-Al2O3 hybrid material was prepared to enhance the bond strength between GO and chemically bonded ceramic coating (CBCC). TEM and FTIR results indicate that nano Al2O3 is successfully grafted to the surface of GO via chemical bonds. Besides, the tribological behavior of CBCC with GO-Al2O3 hybrid material was investigated. The results show that the friction coefficient and wear rate of CBCC decrease with the introduction of GO-Al2O3 hybrid material. In addition, the formation of debris becomes difficult as the cohesive strength of CBCC increases with the introduction of GO-Al2O3 hybrid material, which can improve the wear resistance of CBCC. Furthermore, because less debris on the worn surface makes bigger real contact surface against the counter ball than that of CBCC without GO-Al2O3 hybrid material, the contact stress obviously decreases, contributing to high wear resistance.","Da, Bian;Yongxin, Guo;Vasu, Aradhyula Thirumala;Yaxuan, Liu;Yongwu, Zhao;Yongguang, Wang",2020-10-01,Ceramics International,"GO-Al2O3 hybrid material,Wear resistance,Chemically bonded ceramic coating,Cohesive strength,Bond strength",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.079,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.079
In situ characterization of high temperature elastic modulus and fracture toughness in air plasma sprayed thermal barrier coatings under bending by using digital image correlation,"The evolutions of elastic modulus and fracture toughness are the key factors affecting the failure mechanism and durability of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). Combined the high temperature three-point bending with the digital image correlation (DIC) method, the variations of high temperature elastic modulus and fracture toughness of air plasma sprayed TBCs with temperature are determined. The surface and interfacial cracking information can be monitored real-time by DIC system. The results show that when the temperature rises from 30 °C to 800 °C, the elastic modulus and fracture toughness of TC decrease from 20.3 GPa to 13.1 GPa and from 1.31 MPa m1/2 to 1.16 MPa m1/2, respectively. And the interfacial fracture toughness increases from 83.7 J/m2 to 156.3 J/m2. These results are consistent with the available values determined in literatures, which ensures the validity of this method.","Zhu, W.;Wu, Q.;Yang, L.;Zhou, Y.C.",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Three-point bending,High temperature elastic modulus,High temperature fracture toughness,Digital image correlation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.158,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.158
Development of a carbon-coated reticulated porous alumina material with tailored structural properties for potential radar-absorption applications,"Porous ceramics have attracted research interest because of their high levels of thermal and chemical stability. Reticulated porous ceramics have been fabricated for several decades. However, insufficient data exists regarding the radar-absorption properties of reticulated porous ceramics. Therefore, the authors investigated the feasibility of using reticulated porous ceramics, prepared using alumina, as a platform for a radar-absorbing coating-material, such as carbon. The experimental data were used to determine whether carbon-coated reticulated porous alumina could be effectively prepared while maintaining an acceptable compressive strength by controlling the processing conditions. The structural properties and radar-absorption properties of the carbon-coated reticulated porous alumina material were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), mercury porosimetry, and a network analyzer. The compressive strengths of the reticulated porous alumina specimens could be tailored by controlling the sintering temperature and the pore density of the polyurethane foams. The reflection loss of the reticulated porous alumina specimen with a thickness of 18.40mm, coated with a carbon slurry with a carbon content of 10wt%, was calculated as approaching −40dB at 10.0GHz.","Ha, Jang-Hoon;Lee, Sujin;Choi, Jae Ryung;Lee, Jongman;Song, In-Hyuck;Lee, Seung Jun;Choi, Jaeho",2017-12-15,Ceramics International,"Reticulated porous ceramics,Alumina,Carbon,Radar-absorption properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.096,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.096
Discharged energy density and efficiency of nanocomposites based on poly(vinylidene fluoride) and core-shell structured BaTiO3@Al2O3 nanoparticles,"High discharged energy density and efficiency composites dielectric capacitors have gained world-wide attention. We apply a solution casting method to prepare films of PVDF nanocomposites containing sol-gel processed core-shell structured BaTiO3 @Al2O3 nanoparticles. Their interfacial polarization and discharged energy density performance were investigated. On the morphological characterizations, the core-shell nanoparticles based on TEM were found to have Al2O3 with an average thickness of 6 nm, which acts as a shell layer coating on the surface of the BaTiO3-core. SEM results indicate that the core-shell nanoparticles created are dispersed uniformly in the PVDF matrix. Among the studied PVDF nanocomposites with different BaTiO3@Al2O3 nanoparticle loadings, the nanocomposite with 5 vol% BaTiO3@Al2O3 nanoparticles shows the highest discharged energy density of 6.1 J/cm3, which is 1.2 times higher than that of the nanocomposite with pure BaTiO3 nanoparticles. For the 5 vol% of BaTiO3@Al2O3 nanoparticles added, the resulting nanocomposite exhibits a high efficiency of 81.6% below 1000 kV/cm and is higher than 66.5% at 2800 kV/cm. The enhanced discharged energy density and efficiency could be attributed to the improvement of the Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars interfacial polarization at the dynamic interface between PVDF matrix and BaTiO3@Al2O3 nanoparticles by which the difference of dielectric constant at the interface is reduced.","Liu, Shaohui;Wang, Jiao;Hao, Haoshan;Zhao, Limin;Zhai, Jiwei",2018-12-15,Ceramics International,"Poly(vinylidene fluoride) nanocomposites,Core-shell structured BaTiO3@Al2O3 nanoparticles,Discharged energy density performance,Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars interfacial polarization",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.077,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.077

Fabrication and mechanical properties of multi-walled carbon nanotube reinforced reaction bonded silicon carbide composites,"Different amounts (0, 1, 3, 5, 10 or 15wt%) of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT)–reinforced reaction bonded silicon carbide (RBSC) composites were fabricated by epoxy resin curing and liquid infiltration of molten silicon at 1600°C for 90min. First, the MWCNTs were coated by phenolic resin, which could decompose into amorphous carbon. The in situ formation of the SiC coating via the reaction of amorphous carbon and silicon on the surface of MWCNTs could prevent siliconization. The influence of incorporated MWCNTs on the micro-structure and mechanical properties of RBSC composites was researched. The composites show a higher bending strength of 365MPa and a fracture toughness of 6.9MPam1/2, which are higher than those of monolithic RBSC (a bending strength of 236MPa and a fracture toughness of 3.8MPam1/2). Based on micro-structural measurements, the improved mechanical properties of the MWCNTs/RBSC composite compared with those of the as-fabricated RBSC can be ascribed to three mechanisms: MWCNT pullout, MWCNT bridging and crack deflection.","Song, Ning;Liu, Hong;Fang, Jingzhong",2016-01-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Effect of processing parameters on soft regime behavior of plasma electrolytic oxidation of magnesium,"In the present work, we investigate the soft regime behavior in plasma electrolytic oxidation on pure magnesium. The aim is to achieve thick, homogeneous and dense layers in order to improve the corrosion resistance of magnesium. The compositions, structure and morphologies of the oxide coatings formed using different working parameters were examined by energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. Corrosion resistance of the oxide coatings was evaluated in 3.5wt% NaCl solution using potentiodynamic polarization tests. Zirconia-containing ceramic coatings were fabricated on pure magnesium by plasma electrolytic oxidation technique in two different anodic to cathodic charge quantity ratio (CR = 1.2 & CR = 0.85). It is shown that occurrence of soft regime conditions in CR = 0.85 may be established, which strongly reduce the arcing that usually cause detrimental defects in the oxide layer. As a consequence thick homogeneous oxide layer may be grown without large discharge channels and pores. Growth of the oxide layer can be attributed to a competition between two phenomena, sintering and etching, which induce denser coatings. Unfortunately, the corrosion-resistance performance is still not enough due to a big mismatch of the thermal expansion coefficients of the substrate and the ceramic layer, which produces cracks and peeling at the interface as the coating grow thicker.","Tjiang, Felix;Ye, Li-Wei;Huang, Yan-Jang;Chou, Chen-Chia;Tsai, Da-Shiang",2017-08-31,Ceramics International,"Film,Corrosion,MgO,ZrO2",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.179,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.179
Microstructure and properties of TiC–Fe cermet coatings by reactive flame spraying using asphalt as carbonaceous precursor,"A kind of agglomerated Ti–Fe–C compound spraying powder was prepared by heating a mixture of ferrotitanium and asphalt to pyrolyze the asphalt as carbonaceous precursor. The carbon by the pyrolysis of the asphalt acts as a reactive constituent as well as a binder in the compound powders. TiC–Fe cermet coatings were prepared by RFS of the compound powder. XRD, SEM, EDS and TEM were employed to analyze the microstructure of the cermet coating. In order to investigate the forming mechanism of the cermet coating, a quenching test was performed. The results show that the Ti–Fe–C compound powder has a very tight structure, which can avoid the problem that reactive constituent particles are separated during spraying. The TiC–Fe cermet coatings presents a typical morphology of thermal spraying coatings with two different laminated layers: the one is the composite layers in which the round fine TiC particles (<500nm) are dispersed within a Fe matrix, the other is the paragentic layers of TiC and Ti2O3. The nucleation mechanism of the TiC in the two layers is homogeneous nucleation and heterogeneous nucleation, respectively. The TiC in the composite layers grows in the dissolution-precipitation mode that the smaller particulates dissolve and larger ones grow. The TiC–Fe cermet coating by RFS shows high hardness and wear resistance property: The surface hardness of the TiC–Fe cermet coating is 65±6(HR30N). In the same fretting conditions, the wear area of Ni60 coating is much more than that of the TiC–Fe cermet coating.","Liu, Hui Yuan;Huang, Ji Hua;Yin, Chang Feng;Zhang, Jian Gang;Lin, Guo Biao",2007-07-31,Ceramics International,"Reactive flame spray,TiC–Fe cermet coating,Precursor,Properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2006.01.020,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2006.01.020
"Microstructure and ablation behaviour of a strong, dense, and thick interfacial ZrxHf1-xC/SiC multiphase bilayer coating prepared by a new simple one-step method","In order to solve the shortcomings of chemical vapour deposition (CVD), such as CVD-prepared coatings that are weakly bound to the carbon base, ZrxHf1-xC/SiC multiphase bilayer ceramic coatings were prepared on substrate surfaces by slurry brushing and the one-step in-situ thermal evaporation reaction method. The coating exhibits multiphase bilayer characteristics due to the self-diffusion of the matrix carbon source and the self-assembly of gaseous Zr and Si with the matrix. The 200-μm-thick ZrxHf1-xC solid-solution phase is distributed on the outer coating layer, while the 100-μm-thick SiC phase is distributed in the inner layer such that it contacts the substrate. The coating prepared by brushing with Hf and vapour-deposited with a masterbatch containing 7:3 (w/w) Zr:Si (H-ST) exhibits excellent ablation resistance, attributable to the presence of dense and spallation-free oxide scale and the low oxygen diffusion coefficient of (Zr, Hf)CyOz.","Xu, Junjie;Sun, Wei;Xiong, Xiang;Xu, Yonglong;Deng, Nanjun;Li, Wanqian;Chen, Zhaoke",2020-06-01,Ceramics International,"Ablation performance,ZrxHf1-xC/SiC,Multiphase bilayer coating,Ultrahigh temperature ceramic,Mechanical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.244,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.244
The effect of ceramic nanoparticles on tribological properties of alumina sol–gel thin coatings,"Thin alumina coatings containing zirconia or alumina nanoparticles having diameter of ∼20–30nm were deposited by the sol–gel dip-coating process on silicon wafers. The mass content of nanoparticles in the alumina coating was fixed at 15% in relation to the theoretical mass of alumina matrix resulted from the amount of the applied precursor. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to image the surface topography of as-made coatings and find out the wear level after frictional tests. Tribological tests were performed with the use of a microtribometer operating in the load range of 30–100mN. It was found that the presence of α-alumina (corundum) or zirconia nanoparticles enhances the tribological performance of alumina layers annealed at 100°C by decreasing the average wear rate by 20% and 63% for zirconia and corundum nanoparticles, respectively. No wear was observed for samples containing both types of nanoparticles annealed at 500°C.","Piwoński, Ireneusz;Soliwoda, Katarzyna",2010-01-31,Ceramics International,"B. Nanocomposites,B.

Fabrication of superhydrophobic surfaces with tunable water droplet adhesion force by a two-step method,"In this paper, we present a convenient approach to prepare hierarchical structured superhydrophobic coatings with tunable adhesion force, composed of micro-size glass beads, nano-size SiO2 particles and epoxy resin. Surfaces of two types with different roughness were fabricated, one type is only with single-scale roughness demonstrating lotus effect with low sliding angle, the other type is hierarchically micro-nano-structured roughness exhibiting petal effect with high adhesion force. The surface roughness is pivotal for controlling the wetting behavior and regulating the contact angle including the contact angle hysteresis. Varying the density of micro-size glass beads could adjust the roughness of the surface, which means the adhesion force of the prepared surface could be easily controlled based on the proposed method. Through variation of glass beads’ amount, the surface could be designed to pin the water droplet with different adhesion force when the surface turned upside down. The surface wettability, surface morphology, adhesion force of the prepared samples are investigated and mechanism of the Cassie-to-Wenzel state transition are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the convenient method provides a possibility for controlling surface morphology, composition and corresponding surface adhesion which could be applied to various substrates such as tile, wood, steel and fabric.","Lu, Zhenzhen;He, Yang",2019-08-01,Ceramics International,"Tunable adhesion force,Micro-size glass beads,Pinning water,Facile fabrication,The Cassie-to-Wenzel state transition",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.156,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.156
Changes in thermal conductivity and thermal shock resistance of YSZ-SiO2 suspension plasma spray coatings according to various raw material particle sizes,"Recently, a technique for improving the thermal efficiency of automotive engines has received considerable attention, namely the application of thermal insulation coatings to automotive engine components to reduce heat loss. This study presents thermal shock resistance and related microstructural changes and thermal properties of 8 wt% yttria-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ)/SiO2 multi-compositional thermal insulation coatings with suspensions of various particle sizes, when subjected to suspension plasma spray. After 10,000 cycles of thermal shock testing of the coatings, it was found that different degradation behavior related to the different microstructure of the coatings was influenced by the particle sizes of the suspension. The thermal conductivity of the coatings was significantly reduced by increasing the distribution of the unmelted particles within the coating.","Jeon, Hakbeom;Lee, Inhwan;Oh, Yoonsuk",2020-10-02,Ceramics International,"Thermal insulation coating,Suspension plasma spray,Automotive engine,Thermal shock resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.219,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.219
Effect of the film thickness on the fabrication of ordered TiO2 thin film microstructures by transfer printing,"This paper describes a transfer printing technique for directly patterning ordered TiO2 thin films onto Si substrates. Two- or three-dimensional TiO2 structures can be fabricated onto an Si substrate depending on the coating film thickness, which is controlled via the liquid phase deposition process parameters and attractive interaction forces between a poly(dimethylsiloxane) stamp and a polyelectrolyte layer during the transfer printing process. This additive transfer process is mediated by the presence of a thiol (SH)-terminated 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane self-assembled monolayer on the wafer surface. The transferred patterns are chemically bonded to the wafer surface, exhibiting strong adhesion. The attractive interaction forces between the stamp and the polyelectrolyte layer was weak enough to allow ready detachment of the patterns from the stamp during printing. Even the parts of a continuous TiO2 film that are not in contact with the substrate effectively transfer to form a free-standing structure. With long and short deposition times, three-dimensional structures and ordered two-dimensional round-hole grid structures, respectively, are obtained after the removal of the stamps.","Lee, Jian-Hong;Tsai, Shu-Yi;Kuo, Chia-Hung;Hon, Min-Hsiung;Leu, Ing-Chi",2013-05-31,Ceramics International,"Transfer printing,Self-assembled monolayer,TiO2 microstructures",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.10.260,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.10.260

The influence of the components proportion and the pH value of the plating solution on the Cu layer were analyzed with XRD and SEM. The results showed that the proportion of the plating solution components plays an important role for synthesizing the Al2O3/Cu composite powders. The content of copper in the composite powders could be effectively controlled by adjusting the content of copper sulfate and formaldehyde in the plating solution. Furthermore, the pretreatment of the Al2O3 powders is also a key factor to form a uniform Cu layer coating Al2O3 particles.

Development of a new TiO2 ultrafiltration membrane on flat ceramic support made from natural bentonite and micronized phosphate and applied for dye removal,"A new ultrafiltration (UF) composite membrane was developed during this investigation, based on a ceramic support that ensures high mechanical strength and low resistance to fluid passage. Microfiltration (MF) supports were made by uniaxial pressing of bentonite powder and micronized phosphate. Changes in morphology, shrinkage, porosity and mechanical strength of the moldings were monitored as a function of applied thermal cycles in order to obtain optimal treatment conditions. Optimal conditions of sintered membrane support were of 30% of micronized phosphate at 950°C leading to a porosity of 34.06% and a good mechanical resistance (14.6MPa approx.). The resulting support was used to develop a TiO2 UF membrane by utilizing a spin-coating technique. Visual inspection of the sintered membrane at 800°C under a scanning electron microscope showed that the deposited layer was homogeneous and free of structural defects. The resulting pore diameters were determined to be approximately 72nm. Finally resulting UF membranes were tested by the filtration of Direct Red 80 solution.","Bouazizi, A.;Breida, M.;Karim, A.;Achiou, B.;Ouammou, M.;Calvo, J.I.;Aaddane, A.;Khiat, K.;Younssi, S.

Oxygen diffusion through environmental barrier coating materials,"Environmental barrier coatings (EBCs) are commonly used to protect SiC ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) from corrosion in combustion environments, thus extending their service life in hot-zones. The dominant process that affects the service life of CMCs is the thermal growth of oxide materials, which is facilitated by oxygen diffusion through the EBCs. In this study, the oxygen diffusion behavior through EBC materials, such as Sc2Si2O7, Yb2Si2O7, and Y2Si2O7, in a temperature range of 1100 °C–1300 °C was assessed using an 18O2 tracer. The 18O and 16O isotope exchange depth profiles were characterized by time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). The SIMS data were fit with a semi-infinite diffusion model to calculate the diffusion coefficients and activation energies for oxygen transport through the EBC materials. Y2Si2O7 had the lowest oxygen diffusion coefficient, while Yb2Si2O7 had the highest. The differences in oxygen diffusivity can be explained by the variations of the disilicate crystal structures in the different EBC materials. The analysis identified both crystal structure and bond length as dominant factors influencing oxygen diffusion. The methods and results of this study can be applied to the screening of EBC materials with strong oxidation resistance, thus ensuring a long service life for EBCs/CMCs.","Zhao, Guangxu;Xu, Baosheng;Ren, Ke;Shao, Gang;Wang, Yiguang",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"Oxygen diffusion behaviors,ToF-SIMS,Environmental barrier coatings,Crystal structures",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.007
A novel non-skid composite coating with higher corrosion resistance,"In this work, low-pressure cold-sprayed Ni-Zn-Al2O3 intermediate layers were deposited between supersonic–plasma-sprayed NiCr-Cr3C2 surface layers and underlying low-carbon steel layers to form a sandwich structure that enhances the corrosion resistance of non-skid NiCr-Cr3C2 coatings. The corrosion performance of these bi-layer non-skid coatings and that of a single-layer coating were investigated through electrochemical measurements and observations of their corrosion morphologies. The novel non-skid coating with a top layer possessing a fine powder grain size exhibited the best corrosion resistance because of the pseudopassivation of the interlayer and physical barriers created by the corrosion process. The intermediate layer substantially improved the corrosion resistance of the non-skid coatings.","Bai, Yang;Li, Xiangbo;Xing, Lukuo;Wang, Zhenhua;Li, Yan",2017-12-01,Ceramics International,"Corrosion resistance,Supersonic plasma spraying,Non-skid coatings,EIS,Salt spray corrosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.038,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.038
"Microstructural, mechanical and thermal shock properties of triple-layer TBCs with different thicknesses of bond coat and ceramic top coat deposited onto polyimide matrix composite","In this study, a triple-layer thermal barrier coating (TBC) of Cu-6Sn/NiCrAlY/YSZ was deposited onto a carbon-fiber reinforced polyimide matrix composite. Effects of different thicknesses of YSZ ceramic top coat and NiCrAlY intermediate layer on microstructural, mechanical and thermal shock properties of the coated samples were examined. The results revealed that the TBC systems with up to 300µm top coat thicknesses have clean and adhesive coating/substrate interfaces whereas cracks exist along coating/substrate interface of the TBC system with 400µm thick YSZ. Tensile adhesion test (TAT) indicated that adhesion strength values of the coated samples are inversely proportional to the ceramic top coat thickness. Contrarily, thermal shock resistance of the coated samples enhanced with increase in thickness of the ceramic coating. Investigation of the TBCs with different thicknesses of NiCrAlY and 300µm thick YSZ layers revealed that the TBC system with 100µm thick NiCrAlY layer exhibited the best adhesion strength and thermal shock resistance. It was inferred that thermal mismatch stresses and oxidation of the bond coats were the main factors causing failure in the thermal shock test.","Abedi, H.R.;Salehi, M.;Shafyei, A.",2018-04-15,Ceramics International,"TBC,YSZ,NiCrAlY,Adhesion strength,Thermal shock,Residual stress",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.006

The microstructure, elemental composition, nanomechanical and wear properties of bare nitrided and coated surface were evaluated using XRD, Raman spectroscopy, FE-SEM along with EDS, nanoindentation and nanoscratch test. AFM have showed improvement in surface with reduction in friction coefficient by ∼47.62% and ∼45.71% with TiAlN and AlCrN coating respectively. The mechanical properties of MDC-K tool steel substrate such as hardness, elastic modulus and strain hardening exponent got improved post coating wherein TiAlN coating had exhibited higher wear resistance (H/E), improved plastics deformation resistance (H3/E2), high scratch hardness and lower specific wear rate compared to AlCrN coating. This led to lower pile up and plastic deformation in TiAlN coating. In addition to this, wear behavior of bare nitrided, TiAlN and AlCrN coated surface were evaluated under different tribological conditions. Bare nitrided surface worn out due to abrasive wear mechanism whereas AlCrN coating exhibited both smooth and rough surface due to adhesive and abrasive wear mechanism.

In-situ synthesis of MoSi2 coating on molybdenum substrate by electro-deoxidation of a SiO2 layer in molten salt,"MoSi2 coating was fabricated in situ by electro-deoxidation of SiO2 layer pre-fabricated on molybdenum substrate in molten calcium chloride at 900°C. The characteristics of the composition and microstructure of the coating under different conditions were investigated. And the cyclic voltammograms of the silica layer in molten calcium chloride were also analyzed, aiming to achieve a better understanding of the electro-deoxidation and MoSi2 formation processes. It was found that the reduction rate increased with the cell voltage and temperature of molten salt increasing. MoSi2 coating with compact structure was obtained after the electro-deoxidation of the silica layer at 3.1V for 3h. The preliminary study on the mechanism of MoSi2 coating formation suggested that SiO2, CaSiO3 and Ca3Si2O7 were reduced directly on Mo substrate to form Si–Mo alloys. As the process continued, the ratio of Si in Si–Mo alloys increased, and finally the compact MoSi2 coating with a thickness of about 10μm was obtained. The electro-reduction of SiO2 layer was highly irreversible and controlled mainly by the slow rate of electron transfer.","Dai, Lei;Yu, Yao;Zhou, Huizhu;Yan, Xiaoyong;Zhu, Jing;Li, Yuehua;Wang, Ling",2015-12-31,Ceramics International,"MoSi2 coating,Electro-deoxidation,Molten salt,SiO2,Cyclic voltammogram",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.07.164,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.07.164
Preparation and characterization of thick porous SiO2 film for multilayer pyroelectric thin film IR detector,"Porous SiO2 film is used as a thermal-insulation layer to block the diffusion of heat flow from the pyroelectric layer to the silicon substrate in multilayer pyroelectric thin film IR detector. It is important that porous SiO2 film is uniform, smooth, crack-free, thick and high porosity in order to integrate other films to make IR detector having high specific detectivity (D *). In this paper, thick porous SiO2 film is prepared via sol–gel method with tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), H2O, C3H5(OH)3, NH3·H2O as precursors. The thickness and refractive index of porous SiO2 film are measured by Thin film Measurement System (Model: Filmetrics, F20). The surface condition is measured by Atomic Force Microscopy (Model: DI, Nano-scope III) and the Scanning Electron Microscopy (Model: JEOL, JSM-5510). Experiment results show that the thickness of porous SiO2 film up to 3μm can be obtained. Porosity of the film up to 59% and nanometer size pore can be achieved by one spin coating after annealed at 550°C for 30min. The surface roughness of porous SiO2 thick film is about 7.25nm.

Error and modification in thermal barrier coatings measurement using impedance spectroscopy,"In impedance spectroscopy testing of metal/ceramic multi-layers, such as thermal barrier coatings (TBCs), in order to avoid electric leakage, asymmetric electrode is widely adopted. However, how is electric field distribution in asymmetric electrode system, what error does it bring to measurement results, and how to modify these errors etc., are still not understood. In this study, electric field divergence in TBCs measurement induced by asymmetric electrode is investigated through solving a three-dimensional electric field equations numerically. The results show that the asymmetric electrode inevitably triggers divergence of electric field line, and as frequency decreases the divergence increases considerably. When Pt electrode diameter is chosen as 1mm in ceramic coating, the errors in thickness measurement for both YSZ and TGO are 26.20% and 89.3%, respectively. The errors rise as both YSZ and TGO thicknesses increase, while the errors decrease as Pt electrode size increases. The error in thickness measurement for TGO layer is much larger than that for YSZ. Through present research, a scheme to eliminate the effect of electric field divergence on measurement error is proposed.","Yang, L.;Zhu, W.;Li, C.F.;Zhou, Y.C.;Wang, N.G.;Wei, Y.G.",2017-04-15,Ceramics International,"Impedance spectroscopy,Asymmetric electrode,Divergence of electric field,Thermal barrier coating,Measurement error",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.01.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.01.004
Optimized nanoporous alumina coating on AA3003-H14 aluminum alloy with enhanced tribo-corrosion performance in palm oil,"This study aimed to prepare nanoporous anodic alumina on AA3003-H14 aluminum alloy using a mild anodization process with minimal working voltage and treatment time. The microstructural features, mechanical properties, and tribocorrosion behavior of the coatings were assessed to determine the optimum conditions for the fabrication of nanoporous anodic alumina on AA3003-H14 alloy. The microstructural analysis showed both uniform and nonuniform pore nucleations during anodization in H2SO4/C2H2O4, H2SO4/H2CrO4, and EG/H2O/NH4F electrolytes, where the optimal nanoporous structure with an average thickness, porosity, pore diameter, and interpore distance of 382 nm, 19%, 16 nm, and 35 nm, respectively, was developed after a short-time mild anodization for 30 min at constant potential of 12 V using 15 wt% H2SO4 electrolyte. The XRD profiles indicated formation of a highly-disordered and amorphous nanoporous anodic alumina. Due to the loss of mechanical properties after heat treatment at 450 °C for 90 min, Vickers microhardness of the samples decreased drastically from 124 to 90.5 HV, respectively. The wear analysis indicated an improved tribological behavior by mild electrochemical anodization owing to the development of nanoporous anodic alumina, which acted as the liquid lubricant reservoir and increased the tribological performance of the workpiece. In addition, the heat treated specimen showed the lowest corrosion rate of 0.079 mm.y-1 and utmost corrosion protection efficiency of 95.24% following exposure in palm oil methyl ester (B100). This novel nanoporous configuration not only endows excellent tribological performance in the biofuel combustion environment, but also particularly decreases consumption of liquid lubricants through a facilitated multiphase lubrication mechanism.","Sarraf, Masoud;Nasiri-Tabrizi, Bahman;Dabbagh, Ali;Basirun, Wan Jeffery;Sukiman, Nazatul Liana",2020-04-15,Ceramics International,"Nanoporous alumina,AA3003-H14 aluminum alloy,Mild anodization,Mechanical properties,Tribocorrosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.227,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.227
Optical and electrical switching properties of VO2 thin film on MgF2 (111) substrate,"High-quality VO2 thin films were epitaxially deposited on MgF2 (111) single crystal substrate by means of magnetron sputtering process. The epitaxial relation of VO2 film and MgF2 (111) substrate was denoted as (210)VO2(M)//(111) MgF2 or (111) VO2(R)//(111) MgF2, which was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The optical contrast between the semiconductor phase and metallic phase in the infrared region exceeds 40%, which holds great potential applications in optical switching. The energy-saving effect of VO2 films as the intelligent coating of smart window, which is commonly supposed to be one of the typical employments of optical switching performance, can be optimized by regulating the grain size of VO2 films. The resistance-temperature curves were measured by a specially customized resistance testing platform and corresponding thermochromic parameters, such as transition temperature, SMT width, activation energy, et al., were evaluated. The largest resistance ratio between the two phases exceeds 5 orders of magnitude, which can function as excellent electrical switching and may find its applications in a variety of novel switching devices.","Zhou, Huaijuan;Li, Jinhua;Xin, Yunchuan;Sun, Guangyao;Bao, Shanhu;Jin, Ping",2016-05-01,Ceramics International,"B.

Gradient MoSi2-borosilicate glass high emissivity coating with enhanced contact and impact damage resistance,"High emissivity coatings on fibrous insulation tiles played an important role in thermal protection systems and thereby intrigued many researchers; however, there was little emphasis on the mechanical properties of the coatings. In this study, a gradient MoSi2-borosilicate glass coating with a dense surface layer and a porous interlayer was designed for mullite fibrous ceramics. Mechanical properties and structure parameters of the coating layers and the substrate were studied. The gradient coating was compared with a monolayer dense coating of the same composition and same surface density in contact damage resistance, impact resistance and emissivity. Compared with monolayer dense coating coated substrates, the gradient coating coated ones exhibited two times higher load bearing capacity in Hertzian indentation test at the same displacement of 1 mm; they appeared to be stiffer and harder at constant load of 20 N, and showed better impact resistance at impact energy range of 0.25–0.75 J in the falling weight test; besides, fatal radial cracks were not observed in gradient coatings after the tests. In addition, the gradient coating had higher emissivity (0.838) than the monolayer dense coating (0.816) because of the significant absorptivity increase and reflectivity decrease by small gradual slopes in the rough surface.","Xian, Liang;Tao, Xin;Dong, Wei;Xu, Xiaojing;Guo, Anran;Liu, Jiachen;Du, Haiyan",2018-10-01,Ceramics International,"Interfaces (B),Mechanical properties (C),Structural applications (E),High emissivity coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.037,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.037
Low temperature growth of nanocrystalline Fe2TiO5 perovskite thin films by sol–gel process assisted by microwave irradiation,"Nanocrystalline Fe2TiO5 thin films have been grown on Si (100) at room temperature by using simple, cost effective sol–gel process assisted by microwave irradiation for thermal treatment. For comparison purpose the deposited films have been subjected to two kinds of annealing treatments: first set by using conventional annealing and second set by irradiating the deposited films at different microwave powers for 10min. In both treated films, formation of orthorhombic phase of Fe2TiO5 structure has been observed. It is evident that there is a dramatic structural modification when the deposited films are exposed to microwave. There was slight stoichiometric change of Fe2TiO5 thin films treated by conventional annealing and microwave annealing. Microwave exposed films have shown 47% of Fe, 6% of Ti and 47% of O in the films of the Fe2TiO5, whereas annealed films have shown close to the stoichiometry in Fe2TiO5 with 30% of Fe, 14% of Ti and 56% of O. Plausible mechanism for the formation of nanocrystalline orthorhombic phase of Fe2TiO5 perovskite structure at low microwave powers has also been discussed. This new innovative microwave heating could open a door for the advanced nanotechnologies to cut down the process cost in post treatment of the nanomaterials.","Phani, A.R.;Ruggieri, F.;Passacantando, M.;Santucci, S.",2008-01-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Modelling of plasma spraying of ceramic coatings at atmospheric pressure,"Many works have been devoted to the study of plasma sprayed coatings and, if progresses have been made, the coatings are still resulting more from an empirical understanding than from a scientific one. In this paper are presented what is the present state of our knowledge in the modelling and measurement of the parameters controlling the thermomechanical properties of coatings, especially: • - The influence of the way particulates flatten and splats are formed (with their fast temperature evolution upon impact), as well as the way the strands and passes thicknesses and temperature gradients within them are controlled. • - The influence of the injection velocity and size distribution of the particulates, as well as their morphology on the trajectory, velocity, diameter and surface temperature distributions upon impact. The modelling problems (steep temperature gradients, evaporation, non-continuum effects, heat propagation,…) are underlined as well as the comparison with measurements giving only mean statistical values. • - The influence of the development of the plasma column inside the arc chamber and nozzle, arc striking at the anode, surrounding atmosphere sucked down by the plasma jet… on the length and diameter of the plasma jets and the comparison of modelling with measurements (temperature through emission spectroscopy, velocity through LDA of small particles or fluctuations…) with emphasis on the difficulties which are still to be solved.","Fauchais, P.;Vardelle, A.;Vardelle, M.",1991-12-31,Ceramics International, ,10.1016/0272-8842(91)90035-X,https://doi.org/10.1016/0272-8842(91)90035-X
A novel gas sensor based on Ag/Fe2O3 core-shell nanocomposites,"In this communication, Ag/Fe2O3 nanocomposites were successfully synthesized by reduction of silver nitrate with NaBH4 and subsequent coating of Fe2O3 by a simple Pechini sol-gel method. Synthesized powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Gas sensing properties of Ag/Fe2O3 nanocomposites and pristine Fe2O3 were studied at different temperature and in the presence of different gases. It was found that Ag/Fe2O3 sensor even can detect 500 ppb NO2 gas at 150°C, whereas pristine Fe2O3 sensor showed no significant response to NO2. The possible mechanisms of NO2 sensing by Ag/Fe2O3 are discussed in detail.","Mirzaei, Ali;Janghorban, Kamal;Hashemi, Babak;Bonyani, Maryam;Leonardi, Salvatore Gianluca;Neri, Giovanni",2016-12-31,Ceramics International,"Ag/Fe2O3,Core-shell,Gas sensor,NO2",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.09.052,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.09.052
Fine-patterning of sol-gel derived PZT film by a novel lift-off process using solution-processed metal oxide as a sacrificial layer,"Sub-5µm pattern of sol-gel derived lead-zirconium-titanate (PZT) film with a thickness of 80–390nm was successfully prepared on Pt(111)/TiOx/SiO2/Si (100) substrate by a novel lift-off process using solution-processed metal oxides as a sacrificial layer. The process is simply divided into three steps: In-Zn-O (IZO) sacrificial layer spin-coating and patterning, PZT film formation followed by lift-off process. The results suggested that the IZO layer is effective in preventing PZT crystallization because of its thermal stability during PZT post-annealing, and its barrier-effects between the spin-coated PZT precursor and the Pt/TiOx substrate. Consequently, the micro-pattern of lift-off PZT exhibited better properties than that formed by wet-etching. In particular, the lift-off PZT films possessed better ferroelectric properties, higher break-down voltage, and more well-defined shape than those of films patterned by conventional wet-etching. This lift-off process shows great promise for highly integrated devices due to its fine pattern-ability.","Tue, Phan Trong;Shimoda, Tatsuya;Takamura, Yuzuru",2016-12-31,Ceramics International,"PZT film,Micro-patterning,Lift-off,In-Zn-O metal oxide",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.08.177,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.08.177
Effect of film cooling holes on the mechanical properties of 3D braided SiCf/SiC composites at 1350 °C in air,"3D braided SiCf/SiC composites are the preferred material for turbine blades of advanced aero engines, but film cooling holes (FCHs) severely destroy the structural integrity and affect the mechanical properties. There are few studies concerning the mechanical performance of composites with FCHs. This paper presents the effect of FCHs on the mechanical properties of 3D braided SiCf/SiC composites at 1350 °C in air. The number of drilled holes were 1, 5, 10 (rectangular) and 11 (triangular), and the average diameter was 0.5 mm. Monotonic tensile tests, microstructure characterization and finite element method were performed to investigate the initiation and evolution of local damage around the FCHs. The results indicated that the coating effectively prevents oxygen penetration in short-term tests and composites with FCHs still maintain excellent ultimate tensile strength (UTS). The UTS of the composites seriously decrease due to stress concentration and unbridged cracking propagation around the FCHs in long-term tests. A triangular arrangement should be avoided in FCHs design of 3D braided composites because specimens with 11-H present low UTS. The failure mechanism of the composites with FCHs was discussed in detail according to the FEM calculation results. The research results of this paper provide a reference for the design of SiC composite turbine blades.","Zhang, X.H.;Gao, H.S.;Wen, Z.X.;Li, M.Y.;Zhou, X.G.;Yue, Z.F.",2020-04-15,Ceramics International,"SiCf/SiC composite,Three-dimensional four-step,Film cooling holes,Ultimate tensile strength,Stress-strain behavior,Microstructure,Finite element method",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.020,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.020
The influence of alkali pretreatments of AZ31 magnesium alloys on bonding of bioglass–ceramic coatings and corrosion resistance for biomedical applications,"Coating defects and poor interface bonding between substrates and coatings derived through sol–gel technique are common problems, which are detrimental to protective effects of coatings. Alkali pretreatment was adopted to prepare 45S5 bioglass–ceramic coatings on AZ31 magnesium alloy. After pretreatment, the 45S5 coating was uniform, dense, crack-free and close bonding to substrates. Electrochemical tests in simulated body fluid (SBF) revealed that 45S5 coatings after pretreatment could obviously improve the pitting corrosion potential and polarization resistance of AZ31 substrate, and lessen corrosion current density, suggesting effective protection. The results showed that alkali pretreatment could be a potential process for development of other coatings on magnesium alloy.","Zhao, Huan;Cai, Shu;Niu, Shuxin;Zhang, Ruiyue;Wu, Xiaodong;Xu, Guohua;Ding, Zetao",2015-04-30,Ceramics International,"45S5 glass–ceramic coating,Magnesium alloy,Alkali pretreatment,Interface bonding,Corrosion resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.12.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.12.002
Substrate preheating and structural properties of power plasma sprayed hydroxyapatite coatings,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of substrate preheating on the structural properties of hydroxyapatite coatings (HACs) deposited by using the high power (52kW) laminar plasma jet. The deposition experiments were performed within the 20–200°C temperature range at different stand-off distances. The structural properties in the thickness direction and at the surface of the HACs were investigated by using the micro-Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectrometry, and X-ray powder diffractometry. The deposition without the preheating of the substrate produced HACs with crystallinity gradient in the thickness direction. At the stand-off distance of 80mm, the preheating of the substrate at 200°C practically eliminated the crystallinity gradient. At distances from the coating/substrate interface shorter than ~100µm, the increase of crystallinity with the preheating of the substrate was dominantly attributed to the recrystallization of hydroxyl-rich ACP into HA. At longer distances and higher initial substrate temperatures (>100°C), the crystallinity changes were negligible, whereas the recrystallization of hydroxyl-deficient ACP into oxyapatite (OA) was also possible. The X-ray diffractometry indicated the deposition conditions under which a minimum residual stress was achieved. The results of the present study strongly suggested the relation between the ACP→HA recrystallization process and the bonding strength of the HACs.","Gligorijević, Bojan R.;Vilotijević, Miroljub;Šćepanović, Maja;Vuković, Nikola S.;Radović, Nenad A.",2016-01-31,Ceramics International,"Hydroxyapatite coatings,Plasma spraying,Substrate preheating,Structural properties,Micro-Raman spectroscopy",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.08.125,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.08.125
Influence of polyethylene glycol on cathode plasma electrolytic depositing Al2O3 anti-oxidation coatings,"Al2O3 anti-oxidation coatings were prepared by cathode plasma electrolytic deposition (CPED). The kinetics of CPED process was investigated by cathode current density–voltage curves on the samples with different surface placement directions. As polyethylene glycol (PEG) is added in solution, the spark ignition current density i c(spark ignition) is reduced significantly, and the influence of surface placement directions of cathode on CPED process becomes very weak. Consequently, plasma discharges ignite randomly at whole cathode surface, which would be favorable for the formation of uniform Al2O3 coatings on large-sized cathode with complex shapes. Owing to adding PEG in solution, the oxidation and spallation resistance of the coating are improved, and the critical load of coating is increased.","Wang, Peng;Deng, Shunjie;He, Yedong;Liu, Chenxu;Zhang, Jin",2016-05-15,Ceramics International,"A.

Deposition and characterization of nanostructured WC–Co coating,"Nanostructured WC–Co coatings were prepared with the vacuum plasma spraying process. The microstructure of the as-prepared coatings was determined with SEM, TEM and XRD. The results show that the main structure of the coatings is composed of WC grains with a mean particle size of 35 nm, which have a similar grain size to the primary powders. However, in some regions, the grain size of WC is reduced to about 10 nm due to the melting of the WC–Co powders. In some regions, WC grains are completely melted forming an amorphous phase. In some regions, WC grains have grown to 100 nm; in other regions, the second recrystallization occurred, strip-shaped and square-shaped structures are formed, which are as large as 500 nm. The main phase of the as-prepared WC–Co coating is WC with minor phases of α-W2C, β-WC1-x, and W3Co3C. The hardness of the coating is about 18 Gpa with a wide distribution.","Zhu, Ying Chun;Ding, Chuan Xian;Yukimura, Ken;Xiao, T.Danny;Strutt, Perter R.",2001-12-31,Ceramics International,"B.

Effect of hybrid nanoinks on solution-based Sn-doped In2O3 films under low-temperature microwave annealing,"Solution-based Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO) films were fabricated using well-dispersed hybrid ITO nanoinks, which consisted of high-crystalline ITO nanoparticles and ITO sols, by combining the methods of spin-coating and low-temperature microwave annealing. To investigate the optimum conditions for the hybrid ITO nanoinks, we used four different weight ratios of ITO nanoparticles to ITO sols in the hybrid nanoinks: 0 (sample A), 0.06 (sample B), 0.12 (sample C), and 0.24 (sample D). Sample D exhibited superior sheet resistance (~131.3Ω/□), , good transmittance (~87.2%), and excellent figure of merit (~19.3×10−4 Ω−1) when compared to the other samples. This improvement performance is due to the improved densification of the solution-based ITO films, where the optimum amount of ITO sols in the films served as a smooth medium that linked the high-crystalline ITO nanoparticles. Therefore, our study can offer a novel strategy that can be applied to flexible transparent conducting films (TCFs) as well as to the low-cost fabrication of high-performance TCFs in various optoelectronic applications.","Koo, Bon-Ryul;Ahn, Hyo-Jin",2016-01-31,Ceramics International,"A.

An accurate and rapid method to compare thermal insulation capacity of nine Gd-Yb-YSZ coatings,"The conventional method to evaluate thermal insulation capacity (TIC) of thermal barrier coatings involves the measurement of three parameters, which incurred a large accumulative error. To solve this problem, a self-designed new experimental apparatus was used in this work to compare the TIC of nine ceramic coatings composed of nine ceramic powders with different contents of Gd, Yb, Y and Zr, respectively, synthesized by a new fast hydrothermal method. It was found that the insulation temperature (ΔT) of Yttria-stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) coating mainly depended on the material property and thus reflected the TIC of coating by using this new apparatus. The ΔT value was the temperature difference between a blank sample without coating and a coating sample. The measured ΔT values were found to be highly reproducible. Thus, comparing TIC of the nine Gd-Yb-YSZ coatings by measuring ΔT was more accurate and rapid than the conventional method. The measured ΔT values of nine Gd2O3 and Yb2O3 added YSZ (Gd-Yb-YSZ) coatings were about 10–20 °C higher than that of YSZ coating at 1050 °C. This indicated that the addition of Gd and Yb enhanced TIC of YSZ coating.","Zhou, Shuiliang;Shen, Shaobo;Fang, Xiaohong;Hou, Quanqi;Zhao, Dalong",2019-11-30,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Insulation temperature,A self-designed new apparatus,Gd-Yb-YSZ coating,A fast hydrothermal synthesis",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.247,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.247
Surface strengthening aluminum alloy by in-situ TiC-TiB2 composite coating,"An integration technology was employed to prepare TiC-TiB2 strengthening coating on aluminum alloys, with the combination of Self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) and Vacuum-expendable pattern casting (VEPC). During the VEPC process, the Ti-C-B4C-TP SHS reaction was ignited by molten Al alloy, resulting in the simultaneous obtainment of TiC-TiB2 SHS coating with the cast Al alloy. Specifically, Teflon (PTFE) as reaction promoter was introduced into the SHS system to guarantee the reaction to be ignited successfully. With 3.8 wt% PTFE addition, homogeneous and dense TiC-TiB2 coating microstructure was obtained. Compared to the matrix, the hardness of the surface coating increased from 80 HB to 284 HB. And, the weight loss decreased from 533 mg to 52 mg at load of 20 N, indicating the significant improvement of wear resistance. In addition, a comprehensive bonding strength of 160 MPa was achieved. The proposed method for preparing hard coating on Al alloys broadens their industry application, where higher hardness and better wear resistance are required.","Yang, Fang;Qin, Qian;Shi, Tao;Chen, Cunguang;Guo, Zhimeng",2019-03-31,Ceramics International,"Aluminum alloy,TiC,TiB2,Composite coating,SHS,VEPC",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.096,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.096

Coating antibacterial activities against the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 209Pand Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 were tested in the lighting and in the darkness. Prepared mixed oxide coatings are transparent in the visible spectral range, able to generate singlet oxygen under UV irradiation and demonstrate antibacterial effect as at the light so at the dark. It was shown that the transparency of the coating materials in the UV spectral range increases with the ZnO content reduction in mixed oxide coatings. Mixed oxide coating containing about 90% of zinc oxide demonstrates the highest bactericidal properties.","Evstropiev, S.K.;Karavaeva, A.V.;Dukelskii, K.V.;Evstropyev, K.S.;Nikonorov, N.V.;Kolobkova, E.V.",2018-06-01,Ceramics International,"Transparent bactericidal coatings,Singlet oxygen,Oxide materials,Staphylococcus aureus ATCC,Escherichia coli ATCC 25922",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.116,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.116
"Effects of copper doping on the structure, electrical and low-field magnetoresistance properties of (1–x)La0.67Sr0.33MnO3/xCu (x=0–0.15) composite coatings","The doping effect of metallic Cu on the performances of manganite coatings has been investigated. The (1–x)La0.67Sr0.33MnO3/xCu (x=0–0.15) composites were prepared by the sol-gel based screen printing method. XRD and SEM measurements revealed CuO phase to form by oxidation and to distribute mainly at grain boundaries (GBs) of the manganite matrix. Excess Cu entered the manganite lattice without changing its rhombohedral structure, resulting in a slight lattice expansion. The surface morphology of composite samples changed dramatically with different Cu contents, and average particle size refined with a low concentration of Cu. As the Cu content increased, the resistivity of the samples increased while the metal–insulator transition temperature decreased. The enhanced magnetoresistance (MR) effect close to the percolation threshold has been ascribed to the introduction of local disorder at GBs.","Zhou, Yu;Zhu, Xinde;Li, Shengli",2017-09-30,Ceramics International,"Manganite,Composites,Electrical transport,Magnetoresistance,Grain boundaries",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.017
Molten salt synthesis of a SiC coating on graphite flakes for application in refractory castables,"A silicon carbide coating was formed on the surface of graphite flakes by reaction of molten Si with carbon at 1100–1300°C in a 95%KCl-5%NaF molten salt under Ar atmosphere. The effect of temperature and Si/graphite ratio in the initial mixture on the quality and the amount of SiC were investigated by XRD and SEM/EDS analyses. Also, the water wettability, oxidation resistance and zeta potential of un-coated and coated graphite were examined by TGA analysis and sedimentation test. The results show the amount of coating to increase in the coated flakes with increasing temperature and Si/graphite ratio. The SiC coating improves water wettability of graphite and acts as a protective layer to enhance oxidation resistance. The zeta potential of coated graphite was also increased which indicated a better dispersion in water based systems. These improvements in both the water dispersivity and oxidation resistance of SiC coated graphite would make it as promising candidate raw materials for application in C-containing refractory castables.","Masoudifar, S.;Bavand-Vandchali, M.;Golestani-Fard, F.;Nemati, A.",2016-08-01,Ceramics International,"SiC coating,Molten salt,Synthesis,Graphite flake,Refractory castable",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.120,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.120
IrO2–CeO2-graphene/Ti porous electrode with high charge-transfer speed and enhanced capacitance,"Exploring composite materials with ideal structures is an effective way to achieve synergy among different functional components. In this paper, a thermal decomposition method was adopted to prepared IrO2–CeO2-graphene/Ti composite electrodes. The influence of adding graphene on the composite material's electronic structure was analyzed by first-principles calculations, and its microstructure and electrochemical performance were also observed though various tests. The results indicated that coatings containing graphene exhibited a hierarchical porous structure, which could enlarge the specific surface area effectively. The band gaps of the IrO2–CeO2 composite oxides were filled by the energy level of C, which reduced the electron-transfer resistance. With amorphous CeO2 and the graphene acting as highly efficient ion-diffusion and electron-transfer channels respectively, the electrodes' charge storage performances were improved. The electrodes' specific capacitance values rose at first, then decreased as the graphene contents increased, reaching a maximum of 368 F g−1 when the content was 2 mg mL−1. However, adding graphene could harm the electrodes' cycling stability; excessive graphene could also encapsulate IrO2 nanoparticle and hinder contact with the electrolyte, thus reducing the electrodes' specific capacitances.","Shao, Yanqun;Feng, Keke;Zhang, Shuai;Zhang, Rongrong;He, Sijiang;Wei, Xinli;Lin, Yuting;Ye, Zhanghao;Chen, Kongfa",2020-09-25,Ceramics International,"IrO2-CeO2-Graphene/Ti porous electrode,First-principles calculation,Electron transfer channel,Capacitance performance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.230,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.230
"Effect of ZrO2 nanoparticles addition to PEO coatings on Ti–6Al–4V substrate: Microstructural analysis, corrosion behavior and antibacterial effect of coatings in Hank's physiological solution","In this study, plasma electrolyte oxidation (PEO) method was employed to modify the surface of Ti–6Al–4V. Effects of different concentrations of ZrO2 nanoparticles (0, 1, 3 and 5 g/l) into a phosphate-based electrolyte on the morphology, wettability, antibacterial and corrosion behaviors of coatings were investigated. Microstructural analyses of coatings were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy with an energy dispersive spectrometer. Also, X-ray diffraction, contact angle instrument and profilometry were respectively used to perform phase analysis, wettability, and surface roughness of the coatings. The antibacterial test was conducted with spot inoculation method on four pathogenic bacteria. Polarization and impedance spectroscopy measurements were performed in Hank's solution to investigate the corrosion behavior of coatings. The results revealed that PEO coatings without nanoparticles and by increasing the concentration of the ZrO2 nanoparticles up to 3 g/l in the electrolyte led to a significant improvement in the antibacterial activities of gram-negative bacteria (P. aeruginosa and E.

In the case of gram-positive bacteria, the PEO coated samples demonstrated improved antibacterial effects but addition of ZrO2 nanoparticles in the PEO coatings resulted in deterioration of antibacterial effect.

Effect of molten V2O5 salt on the corrosion behavior of micro- and nano-structured thermal sprayed SYSZ and YSZ coatings,"The corrosion resistance of micro-and nano-structured scandia and yttria codoped zirconia (nano-4mol%SYSZ and micro-8.6SYSZ) and yttria doped zirconia (4YSZ) in the presence of molten vanadium oxide were investigated. To this end, duplex TBCs (thermal barrier coatings), composed of a bond coat (NiCrAlY) and a top coat (4SYSZ or 4YSZ), were deposited on the IN738LC Ni-based supper-alloy by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS). The corrosion studies of plasma sprayed TBCs were conducted in 25mgV2O5 molten salt at 910°C for different times. The nanostructured coating, as compared to its micro-structured counterpart, in spite of a further reaction with the V2O5 salt, showed a higher degradation resistance during the corrosion test due to increased compliance capabilities resulting from the presence of an extra source of porosity associated with the nano-zones. Finally, the corrosion resistance and degradation mechanism of SYSZ and YSZ coatings were compared with the presence of molten NaVO3 and V2O5 salt, respectively.","Loghman-Estarki, M.R.;Shoja Razavi, R.;Jamali, H.",2016-08-15,Ceramics International,"Nano-structured thermal barrier coating,Corrosion,Atmospheric plasma spray,SYSZ, YSZ, V2O5",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.047,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.047
Fractographic analysis of epoxy coated glass,Epoxy based surface coatings can be used to increase glass strength. Epoxy coated samples have been tested in bending and a detailed fractographic analysis of the resultant fracture surfaces has been conducted in order to more fully understand the strengthening mechanism. The fractographic analysis was conducted on samples coated using different emulsion concentrations and crack sizes. The fractographic analysis of the tested samples showed that increasing the emulsion concentration increased the amount of epoxy that infiltrated the cracks. It also showed that the type of the fracture varies with the change of the crack filling and the crack dimensions. The results confirmed that these epoxy coatings were capable of healing small cracks.,"El-Sayed, Tamer;Hand, Russell J.",2012-04-30,Ceramics International,"D. Glass,C.

Carbon-coated SiO/ZrO2 composites as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries,"A combination of high-energy ball milling and constant pressure chemical vapor deposition was used to prepare carbon-coated SiO/ZrO2 composites. It was found that the as-prepared composites were composed of amorphous carbon, amorphous SiO, and paracryslalline ZrO2. The electrochemical analysis results revealed excellent electrochemical performances for the composites, including a high initial discharge capacity (1737mAhg−1), a remarkable cyclic stability (reversible capacity of 721mAhg−1 at 800mAg−1, after 100 cycles), and a good rate capability (870mAhg−1 at 800mAg−1). These features demonstrate that these composites are promising alternative candidates for high-efficiency electrode materials of Li-ion batteries.","Cheng, Fan;Wang, Guangjin;Sun, Zixu;Yu, Yi;Huang, Fei;Gong, Chunli;Liu, Hai;Zheng, Genwen;Qin, Caiqin;Wen, Sheng",2017-04-01,Ceramics International,"Carbon coating,Silicon monoxide,Zironica,Anode materials",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.074,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.074
Stress states and crack behavior in plasma sprayed TBCs based on a novel lamellar structure model with real interface morphology,"To ascertain the crack growth behavior and coalescence mechanism in thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) is beneficial for understanding the failure of TBCs and proposing the probable optimization methods. In this work, a novel lamellar structure model with real interface morphology is developed to explore the crack growth behavior and the failure mechanism of TBCs during thermal cycling. Three typical defects which include pore, inter-splat crack, and intra-splat are incorporated in the model. To simulate the oxidation process of the bond coat (BC) realistically, The oxidation growth process is simulated via changing the BC properties to thermally grown oxide (TGO) properties layer by layer. The effects of the lateral growth strain distribution through TGO thickness on the stress states are executed. Moreover, the influences of BC creep on the crack growth and coating lifetime are further elaborated. The results show that the larger the lateral growth strain gradient, the smaller the residual tensile stress. The irregular interface morphology results in the redistribution of residual stresses. Although the pores and cracks can alleviate the tensile stress near the valley, large stress concentration will occur near them. At the early phase of thermal cycling, the cracks grow steadily. After more cycles, the cracks propagate rapidly and merge with others. The simulated delamination path is in agreement with the experiment results. Not only does BC creep change the crack coalescence mechanism, it also decreases the thermal cyclic lifetime of TBCs. The coating optimization method proposed in this study provides another option for developing advanced TBCs with longer lifetime.","Wei, Zhi-Yuan;Cai, Hong-Neng",2019-10-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs),Lamellar structure,Crack growth,Coating delamination,Creep",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.243,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.243
Friction properties of high temperature boride coating under dry air and water vapor ambiences,"NiCoCrAlY/ZrB2–B4C composite coatings were prepared by atmospheric plasma spraying using a clad powder and their microstructure, phase composition and mechanical properties were characterized. The friction and wear behavior of the coatings were evaluated from room temperature to 800°C in dry air and water vapor atmospheres using a ball-on-disk tribometer. The results show that the NiCoCrAlY/ZrB2–B4C composite coating exhibited low porosity (6.7±0.8%), high Rockwell hardness (HR45y82±5) and high cohesive strength (18±3MPa), as well as good friction and excellent anti-wear ability up to 800°C. The friction coefficients and wear rates of the coating under water vapor ambience were lower than that under dry air. The main reason is the synergistic effect of layer structured lubricating H3BO3 and molten B2O3 films, which were produced by the reaction of the boride with O2 and H2O in the water vapor atmosphere.","Huang, Chuanbing;Zhang, Bingcong;Lan, Hao;Du, Lingzhong;Zhang, Weigang",2014-09-30,Ceramics International,"A.

Preparation of nano-Al2O3 dispersion strengthened coating via coating-substrate co-sintering and underwater shock wave compaction,"This paper aims at developing a process technology to fabricate an aluminum dispersion strengthened coating on a copper substrate. First, nanostructured Cu–Al2O3 powder was prepared by hydrogen-reduction of mechanical alloyed Cu and Al2O3 mixed powders. Low-density coating was then achieved through die pressing and pre-co sintering. Finally, dynamic consolidation by underwater shock wave was used to densify the Cu–Al2O3 sintering body, ensuring strong bonding between the coating and substrate. The compressing process was simulated using the commercially available package LS-DYNA. Numerical simulation gave deformation of the coating layer and pressure distribution during the compressing process. Microstructure characteristics indicate that the coating layer has a uniform and fine-grained composite structure and a strong surface bonding between coating layer and copper substrate. The fracture surface, analyzed by SEM, showed intergranular fracturing. Measurement of hardness showed a high hardness value, indicating sound mechanical properties of the coating layer. This method has thus been proven feasible for preparation of aluminum dispersion strengthened coating on copper substrate.","Sun, Wei;Li, Xiaojie;Hokamoto, Kazuyuki",2013-05-31,Ceramics International,"Aluminum dispersion strengthened coating,Nano-Al2O3,Coating-substrate co-sintering,Underwater explosive compaction",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.10.241,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.10.241
"Directionally solidified Al2O3-ME3Al5O12 (ME: Y, Er and Yb) eutectic coatings for thermophotovoltaic systems","Selective emitters for thermophotovoltaic systems consisting of directionally solidified Al2O3-ME3Al5O12 (ME: Y, Er and Yb) eutectic coatings on Al2O3 substrates were produced and characterizated. Coatings were deposited by dip-coating on cylindrical substrates. After sintering, a continuous-wave CO2 laser was used to produce the surface resolidification. The optimization of the processing parameters yielded dense eutectic coatings with good adhesion to the substrate and with 90–200µm in thickness. All coatings were free of voids and showed a eutectic microstructure consisting of a three dimensional interpenetrated network of Al2O3 and ME3Al5O12. The mechanical properties of the coatings (hardness and fracture toughness) were evaluated by indentation techniques. Thermal emission was studied by heating the rods with a CO2 laser at temperatures between 1000 and 1400°C. Selective emission was observed in Er3+ and Yb3+ based coatings and attributed to the electronic transitions of the rare earth ions. Er3+-coatings showed the best emission properties as selective emitters for thermophotovoltaic converters.","Oliete, Patricia B.;López-Robledo, Manuel J.;Peña, José I.;Silva, Jorge",2017-12-15,Ceramics International,"Laser remelting,Al2O3/ME3Al5O12,Eutectic coating,Selective emitters,Thermophotovoltaic converters",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.212,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.212
"Effect of alumina particle size on characteristics, corrosion, and tribological behavior of Co/Al2O3 composite coatings","The electrodeposition technique was used to produce Co, Co/micro-Al2O3, and Co/nano-Al2O3 coatings. The effect of particle size on current efficiency, thickness, composition, morphology, and structure of the coatings was investigated. The potentiodynamic polarization technique and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to study the corrosion behavior of the coatings. Tribological behavior of the micro/nano-composite coatings was also examined, and the results were compared to the pure Co and the steel substrate. The results revealed that the incorporation of alumina nano-particles decreased the current efficiency of Co electrodeposition. Although the weight percent of the co-deposited nano-particles was much less than the micro-particles under the same electrodeposition conditions, their effect on morphology was more pronounced. The Co/micro-Al2O3 coating had a higher hardness and corrosion resistance than the other samples. The incorporation of nano-particles decreased the hardness and polarization resistance of the pure Co by about 15 and 59%, respectively. Unlike the corrosion results, both the composite coatings had better wear resistance than the pure Co film. However, the volume loss of the Co/micro-Al2O3 coating was 1.6 times lower than the Co/nano-Al2O3 electrodeposit.","Mahdavi, S.;Asghari-Alamdari, A.;Zolola-Meibodi, M.",2020-03-31,Ceramics International,"Composites (B),Corrosion (C),Wear resistance (C),Al2O3 (D)",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.289,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.289
Comparative study on thermal shock behavior of thick thermal barrier coatings fabricated with nano-based YSZ suspension and agglomerated particles,"Two kinds of segmentation-crack structured YSZ thick thermal barrier coatings (TTBCs) were deposited by suspension plasma spraying (SPS) and atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) with nano-based suspension and agglomerated particles, respectively. The phase composition, microstructure evolution and failure behavior of both TBCs before and after thermal shock tests were systematically investigated. Microstructure of the APS coating exhibits typical segmentation-crack structure in the through-thickness direction, similar with the SPS coating. The densities of segmentation-crack in APS and SPS coatings were about 3 cracks mm−1 and 4 cracks mm−1 , respectively. The microstructure observation also showed that the columnar and equiaxed grains existed in the SPS coating. As for the thermal shock test, the spallation life of the APS TTBCs was 146 cycles, close to that of the SPS TTBCs (166 cycles). Failure of the APS coating is due to the spallation of fringe segments and splats.","Zhai, Minglong;Li, Dachuan;Zhao, Yuexing;Zhong, Xinghua;Shao, Fang;Zhao, Huayu;Liu, Chenguang;Tao, Shunyan",2016-08-01,Ceramics International,"Thick thermal barrier coatings (TTBCs),Nano-structured coating,Thermal shock,Failure mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.153,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.153
Determination of crystallization threshold temperature for sol-gel spin coated Cu2ZnSnS4 thin films,"The effects of annealing temperature and time on sol-gel Cu2ZnSnS4 thin film spin coated on soda lime glass substrate were investigated in terms of crystallinity, morphology, composition, optical and electrical properties. The annealing process was achieved in a tube furnace under N2 gas flow and S vapor. The importance of this work is the detailed investigation of annealing temperature and its effect on the Cu2ZnSnS4 thin films that were prepared by the sol-gel spin coating method. The threshold temperature where the film begins to crystallize has been determined to be 465 °C. A temperature increase of 15 °C from 450 to 465 °C boosted the crystallite size and main peak intensities and optimized energy gap from 1.38 to 1.46 eV. In summary, the effect of the annealing temperature on the crystallinity of the films was studied in detail and the threshold temperature value which improved the crystallinity was determined.","Özdal, Teoman;Kavak, Hamide",2018-10-15,Ceramics International,"Cu2ZnSnS4,Spin coating,Annealing,Crystallization,Threshold Temperature",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.129,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.129
Synthesis and magnetic properties of monodisperse CoFe2O4 nanoparticles coated by SiO2,"The monodisperse CoFe2O4 nanoparticles were synthesized by a modified chemical coprecipitation method. Coating SiO2 on the surface of the CoFe2O4 nanoparticles was carried out to keep single domain particles non-interacting with cubic magnetocrystalline anisotropy. The Curie temperatures (T c) of the monodisperse CoFe2O4 nanoparticles can be accurately measured because the SiO2 shells prevented the aggregation and growth of nanoparticles at high temperature. The magnetic properties of the CoFe2O4@SiO2 nanoparticles with core-shell structure in a wide temperature range (300～950 K) were investigated. It is remarkable that the coercive field (H c) of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles increased from about 760 Oe to 1806 Oe after being coated with SiO2, which increased by 137.6% compared to the uncoated samples at 300 K. The saturation magnetization (M s) of the CoFe2O4@SiO2 nanoparticles is 34.59 emu/g, which is about 52% of the naked CoFe2O4 nanoparticles value (66.51 emu/g) at 300 K. The hysteresis loops of the CoFe2O4@SiO2 nanoparticles showed an orderly magnetic behavior at high temperature, such as the M s, remanence magnetization (M r ) and H c decreased as temperature increasing, being equal to zero near T c. This is a good indication that the CoFe2O4@SiO2 nanoparticles are suitable for a wide variety of technological applications at high temperature.","Hu, Dengwei;Zhao, Fan;Zhang, Zhen;Miao, Lei;Ma, Rong;Zhao, Weixing;Ren, Lijun;Zhang, Gaini;Zhai, Le;Wang, Dongmei;Dou, Shumei",2018-12-15,Ceramics International,"Magnetic properties,Core-shell,CoFe2O4@SiO2,Monodisperse",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.014
"Mechanical properties, thermal expansion performance and intrinsic lattice thermal conductivity of AlMO4 (M=Ta, Nb) ceramics for high-temperature applications","The vital thermo-mechanical properties of thermal and environment barrier coatings (TBCs/EBCs) include high hardness, low Young's modulus, matching thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) with substrate and low thermal conductivity. The effect of distortion degree of crystal structure on thermo-mechanical properties of AlMO4 (M=Ta, Nb) ceramics are assessed in this work. AlMO4 ceramics display modest TECs and no phase transformation is detected from room temperature to 1200 ℃. The experiment thermal conductivity can be dropped further as the theoretical minimum thermal conductivity of AlTaO4 and AlNbO4 is 1.48 W m−1 K−1 and 1.05 W m−1 K−1, respectively. The temperature dependent phonon thermal diffusivity of AlMO4 ceramics has been confirmed; the intrinsic lattice thermal conductivity is determined.

High thermal conductivity of GF@Cu@Ni/Si/Al composites reinforced with Cu and Ni co-deposited graphite flakes,"Thermal management of Al composites is a crucial issue to keep the promising performance and excellent reliability of the devices. We revealed a novel method to enhance the surface property of graphite flakes (GF) with Cu and Ni coatings by chemical plating way. Taking advantage of Cu and Ni co-doped GF and silicon powders, the GF@Cu@Ni/Si/Al composites were fabricated by vacuum pressure infiltration method. The GF@Cu-30@Ni-10 composites revealed about 2 times larger TC (474.4 W/m·K) and lower CTE 6.22 ppm/K than neat Al. Our strategy for highly TC offers not only the advanced process for dispersing reinforcements but also an extremely simple way for the anisotropic composites with high TC and low CTE.","Han, Xiaopeng;Huang, Ying;Ding, Ling;Gao, Xiaogang;Xu, Zhipeng",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"Graphite flakes,Cu,Ni,Thermal conductivity,Coefficient of thermal expansion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.254,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.254
WO3 membrane-encapsulated layered LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cathode material for advanced Li-ion batteries,"Despite Nickel-rich materials have all the advantages of high capacity, long cycle life and low cost, there is still a disadvantage that the capacity decreases rapidly as the number of cycles increases. In order to solve this problem, WO3 was uniformly coated on the surface of LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cathode materials by wet coating, and its cycling performance was greatly improved with the higher capacity. The coated materials were analyzed by X-ray diffraction(XRD), Scanning electron microscope (SEM), high resolution Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS). The results showed that the coating thickness was around 3.15 nm, and some tungsten ions were doped into the lattice of the near surface area of the LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 material. In addition, the results of charge-discharge test showed that 1 wt%WO3 coating LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 had the best performance, and delivered a discharge capacity of 140 mAh g−1 (the capacity retention rate is 84.8%) in the potential interval of 2.8–4.3 V at 1 C (1 C = 165 mA g−1) after 200 cycles, while the bare cathode material only delivered a discharge capacity of 120 mAhg−1 (the capacity retention rate is 75%). The phenomenon indicates that the WO3 coating plays a role in inhibiting the harmful side reactions between the cathode material and the electrolyte, improving the electrochemical and structure stability of LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cathode materials.","Song, Guowen;Zhong, Hui;Dai, Yanyang;Zhou, Xiangyang;Yang, Juan",2019-04-15,Ceramics International,"Surface WO3-coating,LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2,Electrochemical performance,Tungsten ion penetration",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.169,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.169
Effects of SnO2 layer coated on carbon nanofiber for the methanol oxidation reaction,"Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) are used as active materials for electrodes in various energy devices, such as lithium ion secondary batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells. Recent studies have shown that nanoscale coatings on carbon nanotubes increase the output and lifespan of these devices owing to the improvement of their mechanical and chemical properties. Among various coating methods, atomic layer deposition (ALD) can adjust the thickness of the coating layer conformally without any directional growth. Therefore, ALD can coat particles with high aspect ratios, such as CNFs, even at nanometer levels of thickness. In this work, we grew two different morphologies of a SnO2 layer on CNF. We used two types of ALD equipment: flow-type ALD (static ALD), and fluidized bed reactor-type ALD (dynamic ALD). Static ALD could form a discontinuous SnO2, while a uniform SnO2 layer was formed by pre-inserting a layer of Al2O3. On the other hand, dynamic ALD formed a uniform SnO2 layer without pre-insertion of an Al2O3 layer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed that both Sn4+ and Sn2+ were present in SnO2 on the CNF deposited by static ALD, probably due to the formation of an interfacial layer between the SnO2 and CNF. When the dynamic ALD method was used, only Sn4+ was present in the SnO2 on CNF. Cyclic voltammetry analysis was performed to characterize the electrochemical properties of the SnO2-coated CNF as an electrode on a direct methanol fuel cell. It was revealed that the discontinuous SnO2 on CNF deposited by static ALD showed the highest current efficiency as well as enhanced electrocatalytic stability.","Kim, Dong Ha;Shin, Dong-Yo;Lee, Young-Geun;An, Geon-Hyoung;Han, Jeong Hwan;Ahn, Hyo-Jin;Choi, Byung Joon",2018-11-30,Ceramics International,"Coating materials,Nanostructured materials,Fuel cells,Vapor deposition,Electrochemical reactions",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.199,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.199
High temperature wear and frictional properties of duplex-treated tool steel sliding against a two phase brass,"Improvement of die life in the hot forging of brass alloys is considered vital from both technical and economical points of view. In this research, pin-on- disc tests were carried out at a range of temperatures to evaluate the influence of plasma nitriding and duplex nitriding-physical vapour deposition (PVD), including TiN–TiAlN and TiN–TiAlN–CrAlN coatings, on the tribological properties of AISI H13 steel. PVD coatings were deposited by a cathodic arc technique on the surface of the steel pins. The mechanical properties, surface roughness and composition of the coatings were determined by microhardness, nanoindentaion, Scanning Electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Performance tests were conducted under real working conditions by hot forging of a two phase brass alloy. The results of pin-on-disc tests at 250°C revealed the minor adhesion of brass alloy on the surface of duplex TiN–TiAlN coating. At 700°C, this coating was relatively more resistant to oxidation and thus, it performed better than other coatings.

"Structure evolution, thermal properties and sintering resistance of promising thermal barrier coating material La2(Zr0.75Ce0.25)2O7","Rare-earth doped zirconates are promising candidate materials for high-performance thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). The phase and microstructure stability is an important issue for the materials that must be clarified, which is related to the long-term stable work of TBCs at high temperatures. In this work, La2(Zr0.75Ce0.25)2O7 (LCZ) ceramic coatings prepared by atmospheric plasma spraying present a metastable fluorite phase, which can transform into stable pyrochlore under high-temperature annealing. The detailed structure evolution of the ceramic coatings is characterized systematically by SEM, XRD and Raman. The associated thermal properties of LCZ ceramics were also reported. Results show that LCZ ceramic has an ultralow thermal conductivity (0.65 W/m·K, 1200 °C), which is only 1/3 of that of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). The thermal expansion coefficients of LCZ ceramic increase from 9.68 × 10-6 K-1 to 10.7 × 10-6 K-1 (300 - 1500 °C), which are relatively larger than those of La2Zr2O7. Besides, Long-term sintering demonstrates that LCZ ceramic coating has preferable sintering resistance at 1500 °C, which is desirable for TBC applications.","Yang, Pan;An, Yulong;Zhao, Di;Li, Yuhong;Zhou, Huidi;Chen, Jianmin",2020-09-30,Ceramics International,"La2(Zr0.75Ce0.25)2O7 (LCZ),Thermal barrier coating (TBC),Structure evolution,Thermal properties,Sintering resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.111,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.111
Architecture designs for extending thermal cycling lifetime of suspension plasma sprayed thermal barrier coatings,"Suspension plasma spraying (SPS) as a relatively new spraying technology has great potential on depositing high performance thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). In some cases, however, columnar SPS TBCs show premature failure in thermal cycling test. To explain the reasons of such failure, a failure mechanism for columnar SPS TBCs was proposed in this work. The premature failure of TBCs might be related to the radial stresses in the vicinity of top coat/bond coat interface. These radial stresses were introduced by the thermal misfit and the roughness of bond coat. According to this mechanism, two architecture designs of SPS TBCs were applied to improve the thermal cycling lifetime. One was a double layered top coat design with a lamellar atmospheric plasma sprayed (APS) sub-layer and a columnar SPS top-layer. The other one was a low roughness bond coat design with a columnar SPS top coat deposited on a low roughness bond coat which was grinded before the spraying. With both designs, lifetimes of SPS TBCs were significantly extended. Especially, a lifetime even better than conventional APS TBCs was achieved with the double layered design.","Zhou, Dapeng;Mack, Daniel Emil;Gerald, Pintsuk;Guillon, Olivier;Vaßen, Robert",2019-10-15,Ceramics International,"Suspension plasma spray,Thermal barrier coatings,Thermal cycling,Architecture design,Lifetime",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.065,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.065
Microstructure and ablation property of C/C-ZrC-SiC composites fabricated by chemical liquid-vapor deposition combined with precursor infiltration and pyrolysis,"C/C-ZrC-SiC composites were produced by the joint processes of chemical liquid-vapor deposition (CLVD) and precursor infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP), and the effects of deposition period in CLVD process on the preparation, microstructure and anti-ablation property were studied. The results displayed the non-woven layers of the composites was preferred to be densified in CLVD method, but the subsequent PIP process could fill the pores of the fiber webs. Thus the joint technologies reduced the porosity of the composites and improved the content of ceramics. Meanwhile, the insufficient deposition in CLVD process led to large amounts of defects, which were not densified fully in the following PIP. However, the excessive deposition of CLVD filled the pores remarkably, so the channels for precursor infiltration in the subsequent PIP were reduced. When the deposition period was 8 h, the sample C8P9 had a low porosity, high ceramics content and uniform distribution, which was responsible for its outstanding ablation resistance. After ablation for 60 s, sample C8P9 was damaged slightly, and its mass and linear ablation rate was 1.22 × 10−3 g/s and 1.07 × 10−3 mm/s. The ablation surface was divided into four regions, and the different oxide coatings were generated on these regions. These coatings could provide effective protection for the composites, which made a significant contribution to improve the ablation resistance.","He, Qinchuan;Li, Hejun;Wang, Changcong;Zhou, Huashan;Lu, Jinhua",2019-02-15,Ceramics International,"C/C-ZrC-SiC composites,Joint processes,Microstructure,Ablation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.045,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.045
High-efficiency perovskite solar cell based on TiO2 nanorod arrays under natural ambient conditions: Solvent effect,"Well oriented TiO2 nanorod arrays (TNRAs), served as an electron transmission carrier, have become the hotspot in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) for providing the direct channel for efficient charge transport and facilitating the pore filling of perovskite. However, the interfacial contact between perovskite film and TNRAs is one of the main factors that restricts the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of TNRAs based PSCs at present. In this paper, by employing a two-step spin-coating method, the influence of PbI2 solvent such as PbI2/DMSO + ACN and PbI2/DMSO + DMF + HAc solutions, on the preparation and performance of TNRAs based PSCs was intensively investigated. More importantly, the relationship between the micro-characteristics of perovskite film, especially the interfacial contact between perovskite film and TNRAs, and macro-properties of PSCs was elucidated. Experimental results indicate that two compact perovskite films with similar large grain size were synthesized on TNRAs from the two different PbI2 solvents, which leads to similar short circuit current densities (J sc). However, the PSC from PbI2/DMSO + DMF + HAc solution shows a larger V oc of 1.10 V compared with that from PbI2/DMSO + ACN solution, and thus a higher PCE of 16.57% was achieved under natural ambient conditions. The key reasons for the enhanced performance may be ascribed to the faster electron extraction and larger electron recombination resistance in the PSC, which mainly depends on the nature of perovskite/TNRAs interfaces.","Li, Rui;Zhang, Huanyu;Chai, Rongxia;Zhang, Mei;Guo, Min",2019-06-15,Ceramics International,"TiO2 nanorod arrays,Perovskite solar cells,PbI2 solvent,Interfacial contact,Recombination resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.159,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.159
Formation of CeO2 coatings on Si–SiC foams by electrophoretic deposition and sintering in air,"We demonstrate that AC-EPD, using an aqueous slurry system followed by sintering in air, is an effective technique to form thick ceramic coatings on porous Si–SiC cellular ceramic substrates. As an example, CeO2 particles with high surface area dispersed in water have been deposited successfully on Si–SiC foams by optimizing the zeta potential and dispersion conditions. Moreover, the parameters for AC-EPD were determined by controlling voltage, frequency, time, and degree of signal asymmetry to minimize water electrolysis in this aqueous system. The microstructure of CeO2 layer has been controlled by adjusting sintering conditions to obtain porous and dense layers at 1200 and 1400 °C, respectively. The grain growth of the CeO2 deposit upon the heat treatment was explained by the diffusion of SiO2 into the CeO2 coating layer, which resulted in a firm joining with the Si–SiC substrate.","Spaggiari, Marco;Bianchi, Giovanni;Santoliquido, Oscar;Senn, Philippe;Fitriani, Pipit;De Hazan, Yoram;Penner, Dirk;Yoon, Dang-Hyok;Ortona, Alberto",2019-08-15,Ceramics International,"Cerium oxide,Silicon infiltrated silicon carbide,Catalytic support,Electrophoretic deposition",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.070,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.070
Preparation and characterization of micro-copper flakes /nano-TiO2 composite particles,"Micro-copper flakes were coated with nano-TiO2 in an ethanol-based colloid sol by chemical deposition, in order to improve their oxidation resistance. The as-prepared composites were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Results showed that TiO2 nanocrystals (predominantly anatase) of approximate 10nm in size were successfully deposited on the surface of Cu flakes, forming a granular coating. The growth of titania on the copper flakes seems to be implemented by anchoring TiO2 through Ti-O-Cu bonds. The thermal stability of the composites was tested by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in an air atmosphere. The results showed that TiO2-coated copper flakes acquired better oxidation resistance compared to the pure copper flakes. Oxidation in air of pure copper flakes began at 190°C, whereas the composites did not oxidize until 360°C.","Yan, Jun;Wang, Ming-Qiu;Du, Shi-Guo;Wang, Bin;Zhang, Xi-Shan",2015-04-30,Ceramics International,"Copper flakes,Nano-TiO2,Composite particle,Oxidation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.10.050,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.10.050
Influence of composition on molten sulfate-vanadate salt corrosion resistance of lanthanum zirconate coatings,"Three lanthanum zirconate (LZO) thermal barrier coatings with designed La/Zr ratios, i.e., 0.7:1 (LZO-7), 1:1 (LZO-10), and 2:1 (LZO-20), are fabricated by laser enhanced chemical vapor deposition and their corrosion resistance in 40 wt% V2O5 + 60 wt% Na2SO4 mixture is studied at 900 °C. The reaction between lanthanum zirconate coatings and NaVO3 produces LaVO4 and ZrO2, which form impediment layer and prevent deeper penetration of the corrosive sulfate-vanadate molten salt. Meanwhile, no severe transverse cracks are found in all the coatings due to the columnar crystalline microstructures. Furthermore, LZO-20 shows the better corrosion resistance than others as the result of the decreased concentration of corrosive molten salts at the contacting interface, which is attributed to the fact that the excess lanthanum consumes maximum NaVO3. Correspondingly, the LaVO4/ZrO2 ratios rise with the increase of lanthanum content. These results uncover the key role of the lanthanum content on the corrosion resistance of the sulfate-vanadate molten salt and are expected to guide the optimization of the future thermal battier coating design by tailoring the composition.","Zhu, Changhua;Yang, Lan;Zhang, Chengguan;Yang, Guang;Chen, Hongfei;Li, Qian;Li, Fangzhi;Gao, Yanfeng;Liu, Bin",2018-12-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Lanthanum zirconate,Laser enhanced chemical vapor deposition,Hot corrosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.086,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.086
Surface modification of Ni-rich LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode materials via a novel mechanofusion alloy route,"This study aimed to prepare a composite coating material comprising a solid ionic conductor of lithium aluminum titanium phosphate (Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3, LATP) and porous carbon through a sol-gel method. LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (LNCM811) cathode material with dual-functional composite conductors (i.e., LATP@porous carbon), denoted as LATP-PC, was prepared. The dry-coating method, also called the “mechanical-fusion alloy route,” was used to modify Ni-rich LNCM811 cathode materials. X-ray diffraction (XRD), micro-Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed that the LATP ionic conductor generated herein was uniformly deposited on 3D porous carbon and served as a dual-functional composite coating on LNCM811. Furthermore, the capacity retention of LATP-PC@LNCM811 was approximately 85.57% and 80.86% after 100 cycles at −20 °C and 25 °C, respectively. By contrast, pristine LNCM811 had the capacity retention of 78% and 74.96% at −20 °C and 25 °C, respectively. Furthermore, the high-rate capability of the LATP-PC@LNCM811 material was markedly enhanced to 169.81 mAh g−1 at 10C relative to that of pristine LNCM811, which was approximately 137.67 mAh g−1. The electrochemical performance of LNCM811 was enhanced by the uniform dual-conductive composite coating. The results of the study indicate that the LATP-PC@LNCM811 composite material developed herein is a potentially promising material for future high-energy Li-ion batteries.","Musuvadhi Babulal, Lakshmipriya;Wu, She-Huang;Yang, Chun-Chen",2020-10-01,Ceramics International,"LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2,Low temperature,Dual-conductor,Cycle stability,LATP,Porous carbon",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.023

The extreme vertices design methodology was used to prepare twenty-one coating compositions. Multi-pass beads were applied on the P22 low alloy steel plate. The welding slag for each weld bead was collected. Experimentation's on welding slags have been performed to estimate the weight loss, density, specific heat, enthalpy, thermal conductivity and diffusivity. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transformation infrared spectrometry (FTIR) was performed to analyses the different phases present in slag.

"Influence of Ni-addition on mechanical, tribological properties and oxidation resistance of AlCrSiN coatings","AlCrSiN coatings with splendid mechanical and thermal properties have attracted wide attention as excellent alternatives for advanced machining applications. Here, Ni-alloyed AlCrSiN coatings were deposited by cathodic arc evaporation and elaborated with respect to mechanical, tribological and anti-oxidation properties. With the increase of Ni content, multiphase composite structured AlCrSiN-Ni coatings show a sustained decline in hardness, elastic modulus and the ratio of hardness to modulus, which causes the decrease of wear resistance at room temperature and 600 °C. Nevertheless, the addition of Ni effectively enhances the toughness and reduces the friction, especially, at 600 °C, where AlCrSiN, AlCrSiN_Ni5, and AlCrSiN_Ni20 obtained a average friction coefficient of ~0.93, 0.86 and 0.66, respectively. Oxidation kinetics studies at 800 – 1000 °C indicate that Ni-containing coatings have relatively lower activation energies, 173.8 kJ/mol of AlCrSiN_Ni5 and 156.6 kJ/mol of AlCrSiN_Ni20, than 176.5 kJ/mol of AlCrSiN. The faster outward diffusion of Cr in Ni-containing coatings forms a Cr2O3/NiAl2O4 two-layer oxide scale with less protection effect and poor adhesion, leading to inferior oxidation resistance.","Liu, Zhe R.;Peng, Bin;Xu, Yu X.;Zhang, Quan;Wang, Qimin;Chen, Li",2019-02-15,Ceramics International,"Film,AlCrSiN,Mechanical properties,Tribological properties,Oxidation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.039,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.039
Improved oxidation resistance of thermoelectric skutterudites coated with composite glass,"Composite glass coating was fabricated on thermoelectric (TE) skutterudite (SKD) materials by using the dispersion system of modified nano-silica aerogel and micro glass powder. The organosilane was used as the binder in the slurry-blade process and isolated pores in micrometer size are formed due to the decomposition of polymerization product derived from organosilane and nano-silica aerogel particles at high temperature. These pores can effectively decrease the thermal conductivity of coating layer. The composite glass coating shows good stability at 823K in air. However, significant microstructural changes in the coating were observed after aging at 923K, at which the isolated micro-sized pores grew to sub-millimeter pores while the continuous composite glass coating was still maintained. The glass coated skutterudite materials show good oxidation resistance, i. e. no oxides are observed even after heating at 923K in ambient air. The present glass-coating approach is expected to be applied in fabricating skutterudite-based thermoelectric devices.","Dong, Hongliang;Li, Xiaoya;Huang, Xiangyang;Zhou, Yanfei;Jiang, Wan;Chen, Lidong",2013-05-31,Ceramics International,"Composite glass,Coating,Skutterudite,Oxidation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.11.051,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.11.051
Surface modification of Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 ceramic electrolyte by Al2O3-doped ZnO coating to enable dendrites-free all-solid-state lithium-metal batteries,"The Na+ super-ionic conductor (NASICON) type solid electrolytes Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP) are of increasing interest because of their high total ionic conductivity and excellent stability against moist air. However, they are not stable when contacting with lithium metal because of the rapid Ti4+ reduction by Li metal, which greatly restrict their application in lithium batteries. Here, we propose a Al2O3-doped ZnO (AZO) surface coating method by magnetron sputtering to improve the stability of the Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 electrolyte against the attack of lithium-metal anode and to avoid the growth of lithium dendrite. The Al2O3-doped ZnO coating of the electrolyte Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 demonstrates high chemical stability against the attack of lithium-metal in a wide electrochemical potential ranges (>5 V), as well as an excellent performance of suppressing of lithium dendrites. Furthermore, the Al2O3-doped ZnO coated Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 was found to be the candidate electrolyte for the all-solid-state lithium battery. An all-solid-state Li/LiFePO4 battery with Al2O3-doped ZnO coated Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 as the solid electrolyte shows good cyclability and a high columbic efficiency for 50 charge/discharge cycles. Furthermore, the surface-modified electrolyte Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 by Al2O3-doped ZnO coating also enables the lithium metal battery to exhibit extremely long cycling for nearly 1000 h due to the ability of suppressing of lithium dendrites.","Bai, Hainan;Hu, Jiulin;Duan, Yusen;Kozawa, Takahiro;Naito, Makio;Zhang, Jingxian;Dong, Shaoming",2019-08-15,Ceramics International,"Solid electrolytes,Lithium batteries,Surface coating method,Stability,Lithium dendrites",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.185,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.185
La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3 electrolytes prepared by vacuum cold spray under heated gas for improved performance of SOFCs,"High impact velocity of particles has found its common way into the vacuum cold spray (VCS), but heating gas may further intensify this function, resulting in significantly higher impact velocity. That's the original design idea to realize denser ceramic deposition at low temperature in this paper. In this study, a ~ 10 µm thick La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3 (LSGM) electrolyte layer for SOFCs is prepared by VCS under heated gas. The effects of gas temperature on the deposition behavior, mechanical and electrical properties of the coatings are investigated. Results show improvements in coating density, hardness and ionic conductivity at elevated temperature. Additionally, the output performance of cell with LSGM electrolytes deposited at gas temperature of 400 °C achieved an open circuit voltage of ~ 1.0 V and the maximum power density of 855 mW/cm2 at 750 °C. Overall, these findings testify of the promising aspects of VCS method for preparing solid electrolyte films for IT-SOFCs.","Wang, Li-Shuang;Li, Cheng-Xin;Ma, Kai;Zhang, Shan-Lin;Yang, Guan-Jun;Li, Chang-Jiu",2018-08-15,Ceramics International,"Vacuum cold spray,Heated gas,LSGM,IT-SOFCs",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.220,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.220
Optimized route for the production of zirconia structures with controlled surface porosity for biomedical applications,"Zirconia structures with controlled surface porosity may be used in several biomedical and engineering applications. This work aimed at developing a processing route for the production of zirconia structures with porous surfaces, using the dip coating method and without pore forming additives. Zirconia powders (~ 40 µm diameter) were used in the dip coating suspensions in three different forms: agglomerates (as received), pre-sintered (1150 °C, 1 h) and sintered (1500 °C, 2 h). The addition of fine particles (< 10 µm diameter) to the suspensions, in different contents, were tested to act as binder for the larger particles. Zirconia disk-shape compacts were dipped in the different suspensions and sintered. Pre-sintered powders were found to be the most adequate for producing the porous surface. The optimized binder content was determined as a function of the porous layer strength. A feasible route could be successfully established for the production of zirconia structures with porous surface.","Roedel, Stephanie;Souza, Júlio C.M.;Silva, Filipe S.;Mesquita-Guimarães, Joana;Fredel, Márcio C.;Henriques, Bruno",2018-08-01,Ceramics International,"Zirconia,3Y-TZP,Dip coating,Porous surface",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.042,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.042
"Engineering of morphological, optical, structural, photocatalytic and catalytic properties of nanostructured CuO thin films fabricated by reactive DC magnetron sputtering","Nanostructured thin films of CuO were deposited on silica glass substrates using reactive DC magnetron sputtering technique. Microstructural, morphological, optical, catalytic and photocatalytic properties of the prepared CuO thin films were examined using FESEM, AFM, Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, XRD, XPS, UV–Vis absorption and PL spectroscopy. FESEM showed nanostructures in the thin films, which were confirmed to be of monoclinic CuO by XRD analysis. Substrate temperature variation (40 °C, 100 °C and 300 °C) was found to significantly alter the optical, morphological, photocatalytic and structural properties of the CuO nanostructured thin film coatings. FESEM and AFM analyses showed decrease in size of nanostructures and surface roughness increase with increase in substrate temperature. Increase in UV–Vis absorbance and PL intensity of CuO thin films with decrease in crystallite size were noticed as the substrate temperature was increased. The prepared nanostructured CuO thin films exhibited highly enhanced photocatalytic activities and degraded dyes (MB and MO) in water in just 40 min under solar exposure and catalytic transformation of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) took place in just 15 min. The developed CuO nanostructured thin film coatings are very promising for large scale, practical and advanced catalytic reduction of toxic 4-NP and photocatalytic applications in solar driven water purification.","Sahu, Kavita;Bisht, Aditi;Khan, Saif A.;Pandey, Akhilesh;Mohapatra, Satyabrata",2020-04-15,Ceramics International,"CuO,Nanostructures,Coatings,Magnetron sputtering",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.248,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.248
"Enhancement of dielectric, ferromagnetic and electrochemical properties of BiFeO3 nanostructured films through rare earth metal doping","In this present work first assessment of enhanced electrochemical properties of Bismuth Ferrite (BiFeO3)thin films through Samarium(Sm) doping are delivered. Apart from this enhancement of structural, dielectric and magnetic properties with increasing samarium concentration is discussed. The pure phase BiFeO3 films and Sm-doped BiFeO3(Bi1-xSmxFeO3 where x = 0.05 & x = 0.1) films were synthesized using 2methoxy aided sol-gel process and were deposited on platinum substrates through spin coating technique. X-ray diffraction confirmed the formation of pure phase BiFeO3 with Rhombohedral (R3c) structure. Morphological characterization through SEM presented the formation of nanostructures and its structural transformation through doping variant. AFM confirmed the smoothness of the film with a maximum grain size of 172.72 nm for the measured films. The elemental analysis and elemental purity was confirmed through EDAX. Mechanistic aspects of the prepared films were analyzed through Thermogravimetric, Differential Thermal Analysis and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy. The variation of dielectric constant with frequency was measured until 1 MHz and remains almost constant due to the independent nature of polarization with frequency. The magnetic coercivity of the film improved from 77.7G to 240G with samarium doping. The Bi0.9Sm0.1FeO3 films deposited on platinum substrates enhanced the specific capacity to about 184Fg-1 along with its retention capability enabling it to be used as electrode material for supercapacitors.","Anlin Golda, R.;Marikani, A.;John Alex, E.",2020-02-01,Ceramics International,"Sol-gel,Thin film,Perovskite,Dielectric,Electrochemical",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.175,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.175
Deposition mechanisms of yttria-stabilized zirconia coatings during plasma spray physical vapor deposition,"As a new processing technology, plasma spray physical vapor deposition (PS-PVD) offers the possibilities to deposit coatings with microstructures varied in a wide range, including fully dense structure, columnar structure and hybrid structure. In this paper, the deposition mechanisms related to the above three microstructures were investigated by looking into the morphologies and phase compositions of the initial deposits during several seconds spraying. The dense coating was stacked up mainly by liquid droplets, un-melted/semi-melted particles and vapor phases. The columnar coating was mostly deposited from vapor phases which were transported to the substrate surface in the state of vapor atoms and clusters, growing in a new growth mechanism different from that in EB-PVD process. The hybrid coating was formed by co-deposition of vapor phases and liquid droplets.","Gao, Lihua;Wei, Liangliang;Guo, Hongbo;Gong, Shengkai;Xu, Huibin",2016-03-31,Ceramics International,"Yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ),Microstructure,Deposition mechanism,Plasma spray physical vapor deposition (PS-PVD)",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.12.111,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.12.111
Corrosion of SiC layers on coated zirconia particles in wet atmosphere,"Properties of SiC coating layer in the postulated accident condition of air and water ingress is crucial to the in-pile safety of tristructural-isotropic (TRISO) coated fuel particles of high temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTR). Particles of ZrO2 kernels coated with low-density pyrolytic carbon buffer layer, high-density pyrolytic carbon layer and SiC layer fabricated by fluidized-bed chemical vapour deposition (FBCVD) were used to simulate real fuel particles in this research. The coated particles were tested at 1673 K in a certain flowing air with different water content between 0 and 100 g/m3 for 10 h. Analysis results show that the corrosion reaction took place mainly on the outer surface of SiC layer with changing infiltration depth according to the flowing gas compositions. Steam content was controlled according to the relationship between saturated water vapour pressure and environment temperature. SiO2 layer was the main product formed on the surface with thickness increase from 1.5 µm to 3 µm along with the content of water vapour in air. Formation of two types of micro-cracks after oxidation are observed: micro-cracks on spherulitic SiO2 and penetrating micro-cracks on flat SiO2. Micro-stress generation mechanism is illustrated. Three are also some bubbles are observed either in SiO2 layer or between SiO2 and SiC layers. Results showed that no fracture occurred in the SiC layer after wet oxidation.","Yang, Hui;Zhou, Ping;Zhao, Hongsheng;Wang, Taowei;Li, Ziqiang;Liu, Xiaoxue;Liu, Bing",2018-08-01,Ceramics International,"SiC layer,TRISO,Corrosion,Air,Water vapour",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.086,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.086
Preparation of TaB2-SiC oxidation protective coating for carbon materials by liquid phase sintering,"To control the microstructure and amounts of TaB2 phase in the TaB2-SiC coating, a novel liquid phase sintering method was developed on the basis of in-situ reaction method to prepare the TaB2-SiC coating, which includes synthesis of TaB2 powders and further preparation of TaB2-SiC coating. With Ta2O5, B2O3 and C employed as raw materials, hexagonal TaB2 powders were prepared by carbothermal reduction method at 1500 °C, whose mean particle size is 491 nm. The TaB2, SiC, C powders, and the low melting point phases Si and silica sol were used to prepare the TaB2-SiC coating by liquid phase sintering at 2373 K. The thickness of the coating is about 350 µm. Compared with the SiC coating, the weight loss of the samples modified by TaB2 decreased from 17.7% to 11.8%, and the average weight loss rate of the fastest weightloss zone reduced from −6 × 10−3 mg cm−2 s−1 to −5 × 10−3 mg cm−2 s−1. During oxidation, the Ta-oxides would gradually dissolve in the silicate glass to form Ta-Si-O glass ceramics with dendritic structure, which significantly improved the toughness and stability of the glass layer. The Ta-Si-O glass ceramics possesses the ability of sealing and arresting the microcracks, which can enhance the oxidation protective ability of the coating.","Ren, Xuanru;Wang, Lifeng;Feng, Peizhong;Zhang, Ping;Guo, LiTong;Li, Ziyu",2018-06-15,Ceramics International,"TaB2,Powders,Coating,Liquid phase sintering,Oxidation protection,Borides",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.105,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.105
Two-dimensional Ti3C2 coating as an emerging protective solid-lubricant for tribology,"Ti3C2, as an emerging and potential solid-lubricant for sliding friction, has been evaluated. The wear rate and friction coefficient of Ti3C2 coatings modified samples are respectively about 10 times and 4 times lower than the unmodified ones. The mechanism of friction reduction and anti-wear is attributed to the hindering effect of Ti3C2 coatings, which prevents the direct contact of the two metallic sliding surfaces and the carbon-rich lubricating transferred film between the contact interfaces, which is generated by friction-induced graphitizing of Ti3C2 coatings during the sliding process. These factors together suppress the occurrence of abrasive and adhesion, resulting in the effectively reducing of friction and wear.","Lian, Weiqi;Mai, Yongjin;Liu, Cansen;Zhang, Liuyan;Li, Shilin;Jie, Xiaohua",2018-11-30,Ceramics International,"Ti3C2,Solid-lubricant,Tribological behavior,Mechanism,Raman spectra",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.309,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.309

The effects of the Mg content on the electrical, magnetic, and magnetoelectric (ME) properties of the CMFO/PMN–PT bilayered thin films were investigated.

β-TCP scaffold coated with PCL as biodegradable materials for dental applications,"Requirements for an ideal scaffold include biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical strength and sufficient porosity and pore dimensions. Beta tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) has competent biocompatibility and biodegradability, but has low mechanical strength because of its porous structure. Polycaprolactone (PCL) is a biodegradable polymer with elastic characteristics and good biocompatibility. In this study, β-TCP/PCL composites were prepared in different ratio and their morphology, phase content, mechanical properties, biodegradation and biocompatibility were investigated. After coating, surfaces of β-TCP scaffolds were covered with the PCL while some of the pores were partially clogged. The compression and bending strength of β-TCP scaffolds were significantly enhanced by PCL coating. The degradation rate of the scaffold in Tris buffer was reduced with higher content of the PCL coating. MTT and ALP assays showed that the osteoblast cells could proliferate and differentiate on PCL coated scaffolds as well as on bare β-TCP scaffolds. Based on the comprehensive analysis achieved in this study, it is concluded that the β-TCP/PCL composite scaffold fabricated with 40% β-TCP and 5% PCL exhibits optimum properties suitable for dental applications.","Shi, YunZhi;Liu, Jing;Yu, Lingmin;Zhong, Li Zhen;Jiang, Heng Bo",2018-09-30,Ceramics International,"Osseous graft,Scaffold,Dental materials,Mechanical properties,Biocompatibility",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.142,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.142
Highly conducting Sc and Y co-doped ZrO2 thin film solid electrolyte on a porous Ni/YSZ electrode prepared via simple drop-coating method,"Dense and crack-free thin film solid electrolyte of scandium and yttrium co-doped zirconia (Sc0.08Y0.08Zr0.84O1.92) or 4S4YSZ has been successfully deposited on a NiO-YSZ porous electrode substrate via simple drop-coating deposition method. The 4S4YSZ precursor powder was synthesized using sol-gel method and the NiO-YSZ substrate, with 1:1 wt% composition, was prepared via modified glycine-nitrate combustion method. The NiO-YSZ substrates were pre-sintered at different temperatures, 1000 °C and 1300 °C, to investigate the effect on the thin film deposition and its microstructure. XRD results showed that both 4S4YSZ and NiO-YSZ exhibited a cubic crystal structure with no observable impurity peaks. SEM-EDS revealed a dense morphology of 4S4YSZ thin film with thickness of about 7μm after sintering while maintaining a desirable porous NiO-YSZ microstructure of the electrode substrate for the 1000 °C pre-sintered substrate as compared to a still porous solid electrolyte for the higher substrate pre-sintering temperature at 1300 °C. And from the conductivity measurements using EIS, the 4S4YSZ thin film revealed a notable high total conductivity of about 1.2x10-1 Scm-1 at 700 °C with 0.73 eV activation energy. Reduction of NiO/YSZ to Ni/YSZ further increases the porosity of the electrode substrate while maintaining a dense solid electrolyte thin film.","Alfeche, Dale Mhar;Cervera, Rinlee Butch",2020-06-01,Ceramics International,"Sc and Y doped ZrO2,Co-sintering,Half-cell,Thin film solid electrolyte,Conductivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.058,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.058
Unlubricated friction and wear behavior of low-pressure plasma-sprayed ZrO2 coating at elevated temperatures,"The unlubricated friction and wear behavior of low pressure plasma-sprayed (LPPS) ZrO2 coating were studied by using a standard SRV wear test system with reciprocating motion against sintered Al2O3 ceramic sphere from room temperature to 800°C. Microstructural observations showed that ZrO2 splats appeared as fine lamellae structures together with small amounts of Al2O3 and SiO2 inclusions with different gray levels in the back-scattered electron (BSE) mode. The friction and wear of ZrO2 coating showed a strong dependence on temperature, changing from a low to a high wear regime with the increase of temperature. ZrO2 coating exhibited low friction and wear at room temperature and 200°C. However, when temperature was increased to above 400°C, friction and wear of the coating increased rapidly and reached a maximum at 600°C together with significant noise and distinct vibration caused by severe surface fracture. Intersplat fracture and surface fatigue of ZrO2 splats were demonstrated to be the dominated wear mechanism at room temperature. Delamination caused by subsurface crack propagation and inclusion cracking was the dominated wear mechanism at 600°C. Above 700°C, recrystallization and abrasive wear in the form of removal of fine ZrO2 grains became the dominated wear mechanism together with local plastic flow and viscous deformation.","Ouyang, J.H.;Sasaki, S.",2001-12-31,Ceramics International,"ZrO2 coating,Plasma spraying,Friction and wear at elevated temperatures",10.1016/S0272-8842(00)00072-9,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0272-8842(00)00072-9
"Sol–gel derived lead zirconate titanate: Processing, micrometer and nanometer scale patterning and characterization","To produce good quality films and patterns with high fidelity, the fabrication of PZT by sol–gel process was investigated, and various processing steps were studied. Sol–gel based PZT solutions were prepared and converted into thin films and patterns with spin coating and soft lithographic techniques, respectively. Structural and compositional analysis of the films and patterns was performed with XRD, and surface and topography were studied with HRSEM and AFM. Electrode deposition on the thin films and patterns were done with FIB, PLD and sputtering.

Microstructure and mechanical property of SiC whisker coating modified C/C composite/Ti2AlNb alloy dissimilar joints prepared by transient liquid phase diffusion bonding,"SiC whisker coating was prepared on the surface of C/C composite successfully by CVD, and transient liquid phase (TLP) diffusion bonding was employed to realize the joining of SiC whisker coating modified C/C composite and Ti2AlNb alloy using Ti–Ni–Nb foils as interlayer. The microstructure, shear strength and fracture behavior were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and universal testing machine. The results show that SiC has good compatibility with C/C composite, and gradient interface formed between SiC-modified C/C composite and Ti2AlNb alloy. When the bonding experiment was carried out under bonding temperature of 1040 °C and holding time of 30min with 5 MPa pressure in vacuum, the joints formed well and no obvious defects can be observed. The typical microstructure of joints is C/C composite/SiC + TiC/Ti–Ni compounds + Ti–Ni–Nb solid solutions/residual Nb/diffusion reaction layer/Ti2AlNb alloy. With the increasing of bonding temperature, the thickness of joining area increased due to sufficient element diffusion. However, when bonding temperature is elevated to 1060 °C, some defects such as cracks and slag inclusions exist in the interface layer between interlayer and Ti2AlNb. The joints with maximum average shear strength of 32.06 MPa are bonded at 1040 °C for 30min. C, SiC and TiC can be found on the fracture surface of joints bonded at 1040 °C which indicated that fracture occurred at the interface layer adjacent SiC layer.","Jie, Wang;Yang, Feng;Fuqi, Zhang;Qinglian, Xiong;Yanlin, Xiong;Haotian, Yang;Qinghai, Xiong",2020-04-01,Ceramics International,"C/C composite,SiC whisker coating,Ti2AlNb,Ti–Ni–Nb interlayer,TLP diffusion bonding",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.047,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.047
Facile synthesis of hierarchical polycystic iron-nitride/phosphide hybrids microsphere constructed by CNTs for stable and enhanced lithium storage,"Diverse Fe-based nitrides and phosphides have drawn considerable attention owing to their abundant source, high theoretical capacities, and environment benignity. However, it still remains a crucial challenge to develop a facile preparation approach of robust Fe-based anode materials for the next-generation durable lithium-ion batteries. Herein, we constructed two type polycystic microsphere anode materials (Fe2N@C/CNTs and FeP@C/CNTs) through a scalable industrial spray-drying technology combined with following chemical nitridation/phosphorization conversion strategy. Both the resultant Fe2N@C/CNTs and FeP@C/CNTs materials exhibit unique hierarchical polycystic microsphere structure and improved conductive network caused by the incorporation of amorphous carbon and dense CNTs coating layers. The unique structure merits endow these capabilities of facilitating electrons/ions transport and accommodating notorious volume change during charge-discharge cycling. Consequently, the Fe2N@C/CNTs and FeP@C/CNTs anode materials deliver enhanced rate capability (216 and 232 mA h g−1, respectively, at a high current density of 5 A g−1) and durable cycling stability with reversible capacities of 489 and 571 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 after 500 cycles, respectively. In addition, this work also provides a transplantable preparation strategy for other conversion-type anode materials with poor electrical conductivity and large volume effect.","Jing, Peng;Wang, Qiong;Wang, Boya;Xiang, Mingwu;Jiang, Hongjun;Zhang, Yin;Wei, Yunhong;Zhang, Yun;Wu, Hao;Liu, Heng",2019-01-31,Ceramics International,"Lithium ion batteries,Anode material,Spray-drying,Iron-nitride,Iron-phosphide",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.154,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.154
Characteristics of in-situ synthesized Hydroxyapatite on TiO2 ceramic via plasma electrolytic oxidation,"The biocompatibility properties of Ti scaffolds can be improved significantly by hydroxyapatite (HA) composite coating. We successfully coated the surface of the Ti substrates by in-situ formation of HA nanocrystals on TiO2 sublayer under calcium acetate and trisodium phosphate electrolytes through the plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) process. The effects of the process parameters and passivation on the characteristics of the coated substrates were studied using X–ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Field emission scanning electron microscopy, and Energy–dispersive X–ray spectroscopy. The systematically controlled experimental studies indicated that using the higher calcium/phosphorous ratio in the electrolyte enhances the micro arcs power and consequently, thickens the synthesized HA layer. The HA nanocrystals were tailored on the walls and edges of the discharge channels due to the locally concentrated heating zones, which consequently resulted in noticeable amounts of Ca and P dopants in porous TiO2.","Ahounbar, Elham;Mousavi Khoei, Seyed Mohammad;Omidvar, Hamid",2019-02-15,Ceramics International,"Plasma electrolytic oxidation,Hydroxyapatite,Titanium dioxide,Ceramic coating,Biocompatibility",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.206,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.206
Titania/hydroxyapatite bi-layer coating on Ti metal by electrophoretic deposition: Characterization and corrosion studies,"Titania–hydroxyapatite (HAp) bi-layer coating on Ti metal substrate with improved adhesion strength is fabricated by a simple two step processes: electrodeposition of Ti sol and electrophoretic deposition of HAp powder, followed by heat treatment at 800°C. At optimized process parameters, the bi-layer developed consists of dense, thin and crystalline titania interlayer with porous, thick and crystalline HAp top layer. The heat treatment of bi-layer coating allows elemental intermixing at the interface of TiO2 and HAp, as determined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and Raman spectra analysis. Compared to monolithic HAp coating, the TiO2/HAp bi-layer coating shows significant enhancement in the adhesion strength (48MPa) as well as corrosion resistance without compromising its biocompatibility. The steep increase in adhesion strength is believed to be due to mechanical interlocking and diffusion bonding at the interface. Presence of dense titania interlayer in the bi-layer coating reduces the corrosion current in Ringer's solution to a negligible value (∼100nA).","Rath, Purna C.;Besra, Laxmidhar;Singh, Bimal P.;Bhattacharjee, Sarama",2012-05-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Properties of solution-processed MgInZnO semiconductor thin films and photodetectors fabricated at a low temperature using UV-assisted thermal annealing,"Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation-assisted thermal annealing is used for the fabrication of Mg doped InZnO (MIZO) semiconductor thin films and metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) type photodetectors on alkali-free glasses at a low temperature of 300°C. In this study, the effects of UV irradiation time on the structural features and the optical and electrical properties of sol-gel derived MIZO thin films were investigated, and the photoresponse properties of MIZO photodetectors fabricated using UV-assisted thermal annealing (UV-TA) and conventional thermal annealing (CTA) were compared. The molar ratio of In:Zn was fixed at 3:2, and the Mg content was maintained at 20at% ([Mg]/[In+Zn]) in the precursor solution. After a spin-coating and drying procedure was performed twice, the dried sol-gel films were heated on a hotplate at 300°C and exposed to UV irradiation in ambient air. The UV irradiation time was adjusted to 1, 2, 3, and 4h. All annealed MIZO thin films had a dense microstructure, uniform film thickness, and flat surface and exhibited good optical transmittance (> 86.0%). The mean resistivity decreased with increasing irradiation time, and the samples irradiated for 4h exhibited the lowest mean resistivity of 4.4×102 Ω-cm. Current-voltage (I-V) characteristics showed that the MIZO photodetectors operated in the photoconductive mode. Under illumination with UVC light, the MIZO photodetectors exhibited an Ilight-to-Idark ratio of 7.7 × 102 and had a photoresponsivity of 5.0A/W at a bias of 5V.","Tsay, Chien-Yie;Wu, Po-Hsien",2017-10-15,Ceramics International,"A.

A study of the electrophoretic deposition of bioactive glass–chitosan composite coating,"Bioactive glass is coated on implant's surface to improve corrosion resistance and osseointegration, when placed in the body. Bioactive glass particles were synthesized through a sol–gel process and deposited along with chitosan to form a composite coating on a stainless steel substrate using electrophoretic deposition technique. Stable suspensions of chitosan–bioactive glass were prepared using bioactive glass particles (<1μm) and 0.5g/l chitosan solution. The influence of ethanol–water ratio on deposition yield was investigated. For all process conditions, best results were achieved with suspension of 30vol% water in ethanol–water containing 2g/l bioactive glass. FTIR studies showed that chitosan was absorbed on ceramic particle surface via hydroxyl and amid bonds. In order to evaluate the coating, its structure and electrochemical properties were studied. It was concluded that increasing the process voltage led to an increase in particle size and porosity, but induced cracks in the coating. In the presence of the polymer–bioactive glass coating, current density in artificial saliva was decreased by 52% and corrosion potential shifted toward more noble values.","Mehdipour, Mehrad;Afshar, Abdollah",2012-01-31,Ceramics International,"Implant,316L stainless steel,Bioactive glass,Chitosan,Sol–gel,Electrophoretic",10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.07.029,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.07.029
Magnesium aluminate spinel nanoparticle influences upon the technological properties of MCZ composite brick for RCK lining,"Fabrication of magnesia-calcium zirconate (MCZ) composite brick from Egyptian magnesite and zirconia (9.8 wt%) through adding different concentrations (2, 4, 6 wt%) of magnesium aluminate spinel rich magnesia (M-MA) nanoparticles as a modifier was experimented. Densification parameters, cold crushing strength (CCS), corrosion towards cement clinker components (CKC), and other technological properties of the produced bricks were investigated. The results revealed that MCZ brick containing 2.00 wt% of M-MA spinel gave the optimum mechanical properties, thus the strength was fortified by 44.8%. In addition, the penetration resistance and coating behavior toward the clinker components and the thermal shock cycles of the produced bricks were also enhanced with the addition of nano spinel. The investigated bricks showed higher technological properties compared with the refractory products offered in the market for the cement kiln. Accordingly, the brick free from spinel can be highly offered to transition and cooling zones of rotary cement kiln (RCK), while MCZ bricks containing spinel nanoparticles are recommended for lining the burning zone. Moreover, hazard chromite usage for improving coating adhesion can be superseded by environmental safe of nano-MA.","Ewais, Emad M.M.;Bayoumi, Ibrahim M.I.",2018-08-15,Ceramics International,"MA spinel nanoparticles,M-CZ,Coatability and penetration,SEM,TSR",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.102,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.102
Enhanced electrochemical performance of Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 cathode by surface modification using La–Co–O compound,"Li-rich cathode materials have higher discharge capacity and lower cost than conventional electrode materials such as LiCoO2. However, they suffer from rapid capacity fading caused by irreversible phase transition and interfacial instability during the electrochemical cycling. La–Co–O (denoted as LC) compound possess good electronic conductivity and superior thermal stability, which could be used as a promising coating layer to suppress Mn dissolution as well as to facilitate electrical transfer. Furthermore, La–Co–O (LC) coating layer could decrease the Mn3+ ions on the surface of Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 (denoted as LMNC), thus stabilize the surface structure. Herein, we present La–Co–O (LC) coating layer on the surface of LMNC via an artful sol-gel-based method with a thickness below 50 nm. XPS, EDS and TEM tests were applied to confirm the existence of LC coating layer. 2 mol% LC coated LMNC sample shows much improved cycle stability at 1C (206.3 mAh g−1, 86.2% capacity retention after 100 cycles) and good rate capability especially at high rates. In addition, LC coating could effectively suppress voltage fading of LMNC. EIS results reveal that the LC modified LMNC materials exhibit better electrochemical kinetics than the pristine one.","Luo, Ziyan;Zhou, Zhiwei;He, Zhenjiang;Sun, Zhaoming;Zheng, Junchao;Li, Yunjiao",2020-09-15,Ceramics International,"Lithium ion battery,Li-rich materials,Mn-based materials,Surface modification,La–Co–O compound",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.114,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.114
Modified hydrothermal treatment route for high-yield preparation of nanosized ZrO2,"Nanosized ZrO2 particles are applied in high-performance thermal barrier coatings and catalyst carriers. To synthesize nanosized zirconia, precipitation from aqueous solutions followed by hydrothermal treatment is widely conducted. In this work, a modified hydrothermal treatment route is described for high-yield fabrication of well-dispersible nanosized t–ZrO2. Zirconium oxychloride and sodium hydroxide were used as the precursor and precipitant, respectively. N, N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl) glycine (bicine) was used as surface stabilizer to inhibit the early agglomeration of nuclei, and ultrasonication was used to enhance the dispersion of ZrO2 nanocrystals. The hydrothermal treatment was optimized for reaction temperature, time, fill fraction, and solid content. The synthesized zirconia was characterized using X-ray diffraction, dynamic light scattering, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The yield of zirconia increased to 134 g/L after hydrothermal. Tetragonal ZrO2 obtained with hydrothermal treatment at 200 °C for 8 h at a fill fraction of 80% has a good dispersibility, with an average particle size of 20 nm and a narrow size distribution.","Yang, Chao;Wen, Juanjuan;Chen, Xianfu;Da, Xiaowei;Qiu, Minghui;Verweij, Hendrik;Fan, Yiqun",2020-08-15,Ceramics International,"Powders: chemical preparation,Grain size,ZrO2,Suspensions,Hydrothermal synthesis",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.022
Strontium nitrate as a stable and potential anode material for lithium ion batteries,"A novel anode candidate, Sr(NO3)2, has been studied as a potential host material in lithium-ion batteries. The phase composition, particle morphology and lithium storage capability of Sr(NO3)2 have been thoroughly investigated. Sr(NO3)2,could maintain its reversible charge capacity at 237.3mAhg−1 along with a high capacity retention of 99.08% at 50mAg−1. Furthermore, it shows excellent cycling stability even at higher current density. Cycled at 500mAg−1, it can deliver an initial charge capacity of 103.0mAhg−1 kept at 100.9mAhg−1 after 500 cycles. Compared with other nitrates that have been reported before, Sr(NO3)2 proved to have a better capacity retention capability at low and high rates. The high stable electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the absence of crystal water in its structure. Most importantly, commercial Sr(NO3)2 in this work just needs to be ground uniformly before its use as anode material and does not need complicated pretreatment like doping, carbon coating, calcination or nanocrystallization.","Yang, Ke;Lan, Hua;Li, Peng;Yu, Haoxiang;Qian, Shangshu;Yan, Lei;Long, Nengbing;Shui, Miao;Shu, Jie",2017-09-30,Ceramics International,"Strontium nitrate,Anode material,Electrochemical performance,Lithium-ion batteries",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.105,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.105
A novel phosphate-ceramic coating for high temperature oxidation resistance of Ti65 alloys,"A novel phosphate-ceramic coating was developed for high-temperature oxidation protection of Ti65 titanium alloy. Aluminum phosphate binder was strategically mixed with Al2O3+SiC ceramic particles as the filler material and subsequently deposited on Ti65 titanium alloy by air spraying. High temperature oxidation behavior of the Ti65 substrate was studied in coated and un-coated state by performing series of isothermal oxidation and thermal shock tests at 650 °C. Microstructural and thermal evolutions under different conditions were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron-probe microanalysis (EPMA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). It was revealed that under uncoated condition, the Ti65 alloy experienced severe oxidation and developed non-protective TiO2 oxide film. In contrast, phosphate-ceramic coated Ti65 alloy exhibited excellent oxidation resistance with small weight gain (0.35 mg/cm2) compared with that of the uncoated Ti65 alloy (1.05 mg/cm2). Microscopy results confirmed absence of TiO2 oxide scales at the coating-substrate interface. The significant enhancement in the oxidation resistance of the Ti65 alloy was attributed to the dense nature of the phosphate-ceramic protective coating with great thermal and chemical stability. Furthermore, the coating exhibited excellent thermal shock resistance for having compatible thermal expansion coefficient with the Ti65 alloy substrate.","Han, Rifei;Tariq, Naeem ul Haq;Li, Jiayi;Kong, Lingyan;Liu, Jianrong;Shan, Xiurong;Cui, Xinyu;Xiong, Tianying",2019-12-15,Ceramics International,"Ceramic coating,Ti65 alloy,High-temperature oxidation,Amorphous aluminum phosphate",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.218,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.218
Silver nanoparticles embedded into silica functionalized with vitamins as biological active materials,"The paper describes a rapid and simple method for preparing silver nanoparticles coated with tunable silica shell thickness and their further functionalization with vitamins. Monodispersed silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) with a mean particle size of 10nm were prepared by chemical reduction. Silica coating was carried out using the Stober method, by mixing the as prepared silver nanoparticles with tetramethoxysilane and 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane. These core–shell nanoparticles were further functionalized with B vitamins in order to facilitate their rapid functionalization to a wide range of end applications. Characterization of the newly synthesized materials was made by UV–visible absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and thermal analysis (TG). Their antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains was investigated and the results of our study showed that the linked vitamins on silver nanoparticles coated with silica lead to an increased antimicrobial activity at lower concentrations against planktonic bacterial cells and microbial biofilms.

Influence of deposition parameters and annealing treatment on the properties of GZO films grown using rf magnetron sputtering,"In this study, transparent conductive films of gallium-doped zinc oxide (GZO) are deposited on soda–lime glass substrates, under varied coating conditions (rf power, sputtering pressure, substrate-to-target distance and deposition time), using radio frequency (rf) magnetron sputtering, at room temperature. The effect of the coating parameters on the structural, morphological, electrical and optical properties of GZO films was studied. This study uses a grey-based Taguchi method, to determine the parameters of the coating process for GZO films, by considering multiple performance characteristics. In the confirmation runs, with grey relational analysis, improvements of 14.1% in the deposition rate, 39.81% in electrical resistivity and 1.38% in visible range transmittance were noted. The influence of annealing treatment, in a vacuum, oxygen, and nitrogen gas atmospheres, at temperatures ranging from 130 to 190°C, for a period of 1h, was also investigated. GZO films annealed at 190°C, in a vacuum, showed the lowest electrical resistivity, at 1.07×10−3 Ω-cm, with about 85% optical transmittance, in the visible region. It is likely that films grown at lower temperatures (190°C) could be coated onto polymeric substrates, to produce flexible optoelectronic devices.","Huang, C.H.;Chen, D.Y.;Hsu, C.Y.",2012-03-31,Ceramics International,"GZO,Grey relational analysis,Annealing treatment,Electrical and optical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.08.031,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.08.031
Pure and cerium-doped zinc orthosilicate as a pigment for thermoregulating coatings,"Microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis followed by high-temperature (1050 °C) calcination was used to prepare pure and cerium-doped zinc orthosilicate (Zn2SiO4) pigments. Nanoscale Zn2SiO4 and Ce–Zn2SiO4 powders were blended with potassium silicate (K2SiO3) and then applied to the aluminum substrate to obtain thermoregulating coatings. Electron beams with different energies were used to irradiate nanoscale pigment powders and coatings. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transition electron microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize the phase composition, morphology, and atomic-level structure of materials. The diffuse reflectance and absorption measurements of materials before and after irradiation indicated that Ce–Zn2SiO4-based coatings exhibit better radiation resistance compared to pure Zn2SiO4.

The coatings showed a unique and complex microstructure composed of well-melted splats with columnar crystal structure, partially melted areas, which resembled the morphology of the powder feedstock, and equiaxed grains. Vickers microhardness of nanostructured zirconia coatings was similar to that of the conventional ones and strongly depended on the indentation load.

The surface morphological study and elemental analysis were carried out using scanning electron microscope (SEM) followed by EDAX. The tribological measurements were also performed; based on Taguchi's L25 orthogonal array, considering different GC compositions, sliding speeds and loads. The signal to noise (S/N) ratio was used to identify the influencing parameters on minimizing wear coefficient (k) and coefficient of friction (COF). To improve the tribological properties, the modeling of output responses was performed using response surface methodology (RSM) that was being used for multi-objective optimization using a Pareto optimality approach i.e. Genetic Algorithm (GA). The experimentally achieved k and COF were compared with the earlier work that carried out by the authors for germanium (Ge) doped GC samples. It is observed that the various mechanical properties (Vickers hardness, 29 GPa, Young's modulus, 1808 MPa, and compressive strength, 221 MPa) improved significantly in comparison to the Ge doped GC samples. The improved mechanical and tribological properties of the synthesized GC can be used as a coating material for the structural alloys and machine tool slides in view of its effective wear and corrosion resistance.","Das, Sangeeta;Madheshiya, Abhishek;Das, Shubhajit;Gautam, Satyam Shivam;Gautam, Chandkiram",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"PbCaTiO3,Glass ceramics,Wear and coefficient of friction,Taguchi method,Vickers hardness,Genetic algorithm",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.252,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.252
Mullite whisker toughened mullite coating to enhance the thermal shock resistance of SiC pre-coated carbon/carbon composites,"In order to improve the thermal shock resistance of the coated carbon/carbon (C/C) composites, a mullite whisker toughened mullite coating was fabricated on the surface of SiC pre-coated C/C composites (SiC-C/C) by molten-salt method with a later hot dipping process.

Experimental investigation of Al2O3/8YSZ and CeO2/8YSZ plasma sprayed thermal barrier coating on diesel engine,"In this research work, aluminium oxide/yttria stabilized zirconia (20%Al2O3/80%8YSZ) and ceria/yttria stabilized zirconia (20%CeO2/80%8YSZ) were coated through atmospheric plasma spray technique (APS) as thermal barrier coating (TBC) over CoNiCrAlY bond coat on aluminium alloy (Al-13%Si) substrate piston crown material and their thermal cycling behavior were studied experimentally. Thermal cycle test of both samples were conducted at 800 °C. Microstructural, phase and elemental analysis of the TBC coatings were experimentally investigated. The performance, combustion and emission characteristics of Al2O3/8YSZ, CeO2/8YSZ TBC coated and uncoated standard diesel engine were experimentally investigated. The test results revealed that CeO2/8YSZ based TBC has an excellent thermal cycling behavior in comparison to the Al2O3/8YSZ based TBC. The spallation of the Al2O3/8YSZ TBC occurred mainly due to the formation of thermally grown oxide (TGO), and growth of residual stresses at top coating and bond coating interface. The experimental results also revealed that the increase of brake thermal efficiency and reduction of specific fuel consumption for both TBC coated engine. Further reduction of HC, CO and smoke and increase of NOx emission were recorded for both TBC coated engine compared to the standard diesel engine.","Venkadesan, Gnanamoorthi;Muthusamy, Jayaram",2019-02-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs),Thermal cycle test,Plasma spraying process (APS),Microstructure,Engine performance,Emission",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.218,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.218
Preparation and antibacterial activity of Ag/SiO2 thin film on glazed ceramic tiles by sol–gel method,"In the present study, silver-doped silica thin films on glazed surface of ceramic tiles were well prepared by sol–gel method to achieve antibacterial activity. Thermal treatment was done in the air at 1100°C for two hours. The Ag/SiO2 thin films were investigated through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and wavelength dispersive spectrometry (WDS). Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) was used for the quantitative determination of the silver ion concentration being released from Ag/SiO2 films over a 24 day period. The antibacterial effects of Ag/SiO2 thin films against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were also examined. From the analysis results, it was found that high temperature treated coating consists of two phases of SiO2 and Ag based on the trapping of the Ag phase in the silica matrix. The presence of Ag elements on the surface of the coated tiles, were also observed. Thermal treatment at high temperatures caused sharp XRD peaks and high crystallinity in this system. Ag+ ions were released constantly and the mean release rate (±SD) was 0.104 ±0.01μg/ml during 24 days. Coating films exhibited an excellent antibacterial performance against both bacterium.","Baheiraei, Nafiseh;Moztarzadeh, Fathollah;Hedayati, Mehdi",2012-05-31,Ceramics International,"Antibacterial,Sol–gel method,Ag/SiO2 thin film,Tile",10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.11.068,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.11.068
Nanocomposite powders from coating with heterogeneous nucleation processing,"A nanocomposite SiC powder was prepared by coating nano-SiC particles with Y(OH)3 and/or Al(OH)3 via heterogeneous nucleation processing using a buffered pH solution as the precipitation reagent. TEM micrographs showed the coating materials nucleated and grew on the surface of nano-SiC and did not form sol particles in solution. The isoelectric point (IEP) of coated SiC was different from that of as-received SiC. The IEP of Al(OH)3-coated SiC occurred at pH 7.3, which is close to that of alumina. When Al(OH)3-coated SiC particles were coated with Y(OH)3,the IEP of nanocomposite powder shifted from pH 7.3 to pH8.6, which is close to that of yttria. In addition, the dispersability of Al(OH)3-coated SiC was greatly improved when it was coated using heterogeneous nucleation processing.","Zhang, Ju-Xian;Gao, Long-Qiao",2001-12-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Surface defect healing effect of silica coatings on silicon nitride fibers,"In this study, silica coatings with different thickness were prepared on silicon nitride fibers by a continuous dip-coating method. The effects of the coatings on the mechanical properties of the silicon nitride fibers were investigated. The SiO2 coatings with uniform thickness were prepared from a sol solution with a concentration of 0.75wt% and then heat-treated at 400°C, and the strength of the fibers was improved by the treated coating. The tensile strength of a coated fiber was approximately 26% higher than that of an uncoated fiber because the thin coating healed the surface defects. Our study also confirmed that the size of sol particles must match that of the flaws on the fiber surface before these flaws could be effectively repaired. Finally, a probable mechanism will be proposed here to explain this effect. The present results demonstrate that the strength of silicon nitride fibers can be enhanced by coating them through the sol–gel process, and the findings are expected to provide guidelines for repairing strength-limiting flaws in other fibers.","Hu, Xuan;Shao, Changwei;Wang, Jun",2017-12-15,Ceramics International,"Silicon nitride fibers,Silica coating,Strength improvement,Surface flaws",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.061,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.061
La and F co-substituted hydroxyapatite bioactive coating reinforced by SiC nanowire/ZrO2 hybrid materials for carbon/carbon composites,"La and F co-substituted hydroxyapatite (LFH) bioactive coatings reinforced by SiC nanowire/ZrO2 (SZ) hybrid materials were applied on carbon/carbon composites using a combination method of chemical vapor deposition, slurry process, electrochemical deposition and immersion process. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscope and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were adopted to investigate the morphology, microstructure and composition of the coating. The adhesion strength of the coating was investigated by tensile test and the in-vitro bioactivity of the coating was studied using simulated body fluid (SBF) immersion test. The results showed that SZ hybrid reinforcement exhibited a porous and latticed structure, which favored the infiltration of LFH crystals and the integration between SZ and LFH. LFH showed a flake-like shape with a thickness of 20–60nm and a length of 1–3μm. The average adhesion strengths of unreinforced and SZ reinforced LFH coating were 2.97±0.32MPa and 12.37±0.84MPa, respectively. The in-vitro bioactivity test confirmed that the SZ reinforced LFH coating could induce the nucleation and growth of bone-like apatite on its surface in SBF. It was suggested that the SZ reinforced LFH coating might be an effective method to improve the surface bioactivity of carbon/carbon composites with excellent adhesion strength.","Leilei, Zhang;Hejun, Li;Kezhi, Li;Yulei, Zhang;Jinhua, Lu;Wei, Li",2016-02-01,Ceramics International,"D.

"The role of amorphous phase content on the electrical properties of atmospheric plasma sprayed (Ba,Sr)TiO3 coatings","(Ba,Sr)TiO3 coatings deposited on carbon steel substrates were successfully prepared by an atmospheric plasma spray system. Three sets of samples containing different amount of both crystalline and amorphous phases were deposited and consequently studied in order to determine their electrical properties. The results show a clear correlation existing between the amorphous phase content and coating´s electrical properties. The resistivity increases with increase of amorphous phase content. Relative permittivity for low frequencies decreases and become more stable with frequency tuning when amorphous phase content increased. The maximum relative permittivity value is in the range 75–200 for frequency 1kHz. The loss factor varies between 0.23 and 0.03 for all studied samples. The loss factor is at the lower limit of these values and frequency much less dependent when the coating contains 15wt% of amorphous phase and more. The band gap of all samples is between 2.75eV and 2.90eV. Microstructure and hardness were evaluated in order to determine basic mechanical properties of deposits.","Kotlan, Jiri;Seshadri, Ramachandran Chidambaram;Sampath, Sanjay;Ctibor, Pavel",2016-07-31,Ceramics International,"B.

Stabilizing effect of the carbon shell on phase transformation of the nanocrystalline alumina particles,"Intensive phase transformations of alumina are known to occur at temperatures above 1000°C. In the present work, high temperature behaviour of pure Al2O3 and the carbon coated Al2O3@C sample with core-shell structure was comparatively studied using low-temperature nitrogen adsorption, transmission electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The solid-state NMR 27Al method has allowed us to identify and estimate the concentration of all phases appeared during the transformation of pseudoboehmite γ-Al2O3 into corundum α-Al2O3. The data obtained correlate well with the results of XRD analysis and low-temperature nitrogen adsorption. It is shown that the deposition of carbon coating with formation of core-shell Al2O3@C system stabilizes the size of oxide core and prevents the formation of corundum phase until the temperatures of 1350–1400°C, which are close to the temperature of carbothermal reduction of alumina. The stabilization of the size of the oxide core nanoparticles was considered as a main factor preventing the formation of corundum phase at high temperatures. At the same time, the carbon coating does not affect the phase transformation of γ-Al2O3 to δ-Al2O3.","Yakovlev, Ilya V.;Volodin, Alexander M.;Zaikovskii, Vladimir I.;Stoyanovskii, Vladimir O.;Lapina, Olga B.;Vedyagin, Aleksey A.",2018-04-01,Ceramics International,"Alumina,Phase transformations,Carbon coating,Core-shell structure,Stabilization effect,Solid-state NMR",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.066,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.066
Enhanced cycle stability of LiCoO2 at high voltage by mixed conductive Li7.5La3Zr1.5Co0.5O12 coating,"Although LiCoO2 (LCO) has been commercialized, the capacity of its practical application is only 140 mAh g−1, which is half of the theoretical capacity due to the low cut-off voltage. When operated at high voltage, structural integrity, chemical stability, and phase stability are severely challenged, resulting in rapid capacity fading. The electrochemical performances can be significantly improved by surface coating. Mixed conductive Li7.5La3Zr1.5Co0.5O12 is coated on the LCO particles by the co-precipitation method. The cells are cycled in the voltage range of 2.8–4.5 V at 1C. After 200 cycles, LCO can only maintain 70.5% of its initial capacity, and in contrast, the capacity retention of coated LCO is as high as 96.1%. The particles of pristine LCO have been fractured or pulverized after 200 cycles, while the structural integrity of coated LCO particles is maintained.","Cheng, Xu;Qiang, Wenjiang;Huang, Bingxin",2020-11-30,Ceramics International,"Lithium cobalt oxide,Co-precipitation,Coating,Cycle stability,Structural integrity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.080,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.080
Photocatalytic properties of TiO2 sol–gel modified nanocomposite films,"TiO2 nanocomposite films with different concentrations of TiO2 MT-150A nanoparticles were immobilized on glass substrates using a dip coating process. The crystalline structure and surface chemical state of nanocomposite film properties were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. The specific surface area and morphology of TiO2 MT-150A nanoparticles were evaluated by the BET method and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM). The photocatalytic activities of films were evaluated by the methyl orange decoloring rate. XPS measurements showed that the oxygen amount (%) was related to the film composition. The composite film with 10g/L MT-150A loading yielded the highest amount of surface oxygen (26.82%) and TiO2 rutile showed the lowest amount of surface oxygen (13.67%) in the form of surface hydroxyl groups. The remaining oxygen was identified as lattice oxygen.

Modelling and evaluating thermal conductivity of porous thermal barrier coatings at elevated temperatures,"Thermal conductivity of various porous thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) used at elevated temperatures for gas turbines has been evaluated using the proposed six-phase model. These TBCs rely on microstructural properties and yield different types of porosities. This paper studies the thermal conductivity of TBCs based on microstructural features to evaluate the effect of different types of porosities on thermal conductivity. The first part of this paper investigates the microstructural characterization of various TBCs using image analysis (IA) technique. The second part of this paper evaluates the thermal conductivity using the image analysis. The volumetric fraction of porosities along with their orientation, shape and morphology, shows a considerable impact on the overall thermal conductivity of TBCs. The proposed six-phase model can predict thermal conductivity of porous TBCs with a good agreement with the measured values. The model results can help to better understand the effect of microstructural changes on thermal conductivity and can provide useful guide to fabricate TBCs with low thermal conductivity.","Moteb, Alotaibi;Chen, Kuiying",2020-10-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Thermal conductivity,Image analysis,Porosity,Six-phase model",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.228,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.228
Microstructure and mechanical properties of multi-walled carbon nanotubes containing Al2O3–C refractories with addition of polycarbosilane,"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are a promising reinforcement for fabricating Al2O3–C refractories. However, CNTs are prone to agglomerate or react with antioxidants or reactive gaseous phases such as Al (g), Si (g) and SiO (g), etc. at high temperatures. To overcome the problems above, polycarbosilane (PCS) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were firstly mixed with micro-alumina powder in a liquid medium and then incorporated into Al2O3–C refractories. Then the microstructure and mechanical properties of Al2O3–C refractories fired in the temperature range from 800°C to 1400°C were investigated in this work. The results showed that the MWCNTs were well dispersed in the specimens with addition of PCS in contrast to the specimens without PCS due to the PCS adsorption on the surface of MWCNTs during the mixing process. And the mechanical properties, such as cold modulus of rupture (CMOR), flexural modulus (FM), forces and displacements of Al2O3–C refractories with PCS were much higher than those without PCS, which was attributed to more homogeneous dispersion of MWCNTs, more residual MWCNTs as well as different morphologies of ceramic whiskers. Meanwhile, the oxidation resistance of Al2O3–C refractories with PCS was improved greatly, which was supposed that the in situ formed SiC x O y coating prevented the oxidation of MWCNTs to some extent.","Luo, Ming;Li, Yawei;Jin, Shengli;Sang, Shaobai;Zhao, Lei;Wang, Qinghu;Li, Yuanbing",2013-07-31,Ceramics International,"C.

The effect of CuO coatings on the electrokinetic properties of stone wool fibres determined by streaming potential measurements,"Commercial stone wool fibres were modified with copper(II) oxide coatings. This oxide is widely used in processes of surface modification for filter materials to improve its bacterial retention. The microorganisms are already susceptible to low concentrations of copper in contrast to humans for which copper is an inert material in the concentration range. Additionally, the coatings changed the electrokinetic properties of the fibres. As a result, the isoelectric point (IEP) of the untreated fibres was shifted from acidic towards a more basic pH range. A positive or no charge on the surface of the fibres allows them to be a substrate for the positively charged adsorbents of negatively charged waterborne contaminants with the use of electrostatic adsorption. The coatings were prepared by dip coating with the use of two different coating precursors: the aqueous suspension of CuO nanoparticles and aqueous solutions of copper(II) nitrate trihydrate or copper(II) acetate or a mixture of thereof. The zeta potential of the modified fibres was determined by a streaming potential method. The adhesion of the coatings was tested by flushing and ultrasonication of the modified fibres. The isoelectric point of the fibres was shifted towards a more basic pH range for all precursors with the largest impact of the copper(II) nitrate trihydrate precursor. This coating changed the IEP of the fibres from 4.1 to 8.3 pH value. The highest calculated coverage of the coatings was in the range of 54% and was obtained by using copper(II) nitrate trihydrate/CuO nanoparticles precursor. Although, we do not predict such modified fibres to act as a standalone water filter, we believe they have the potential to be an excellent support material for active adsorbents.","Schabikowski, Mateusz;Zalewska, Milena;Kata, Dariusz;Graule, Thomas",2016-09-30,Ceramics International,"Fibres,Surfaces,Sol-gel processes,Streaming potential,Zeta potential",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.207,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.207
Investigations of reticulated porous alumina foam ceramics based on different coating techniques with the aid of μCT and statistical characteristics,"Alumina foam ceramic filters were prepared due to the “replica technique”. The parameters of the two coating steps were varied to find the optimal processing route to prepare ceramic foam filters with a good homogeneous distribution of the strut thickness. Different additives for the slurry for the impregnation (first coating) step were investigated with the aid of rheological measurements. For the second coating step spraying as well as centrifuging techniques with different processing parameters were studied. The sintered foam structure (strut diameter, pore size and porosity) was characterized with the aid of CT-images and described with an image analysis software and statistical tools. The mechanical properties depend strongly on the achieved structure of the filter and especially on the distribution of the strut thickness in the inner volume side of the filter. A centrifuging technique with a pressure supported dipping as well as optimum processing parameters of the spraying step led to improved mechanical properties as well as homogenous macro-structures.","Voigt, Claudia;Jäckel, Eva;Aneziris, Christos G.;Hubálková, Jana",2013-04-30,Ceramics International,"Alumina,Rheology,Homogeneity,Reticulated porous ceramics",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.09.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.09.001
Improved Li-storage performance of CNTs-decorated LiVPO4F/C cathode material for electrochemical energy storage,"Lithium vanadium fluorophosphate (LiVPO4F) has been attracted increasing attention as an advanced cathode for Li-ion batteries because of its excellent thermal stability and high operating voltage. Nevertheless, the pure LiVPO4F possesses a low electrical conductivity which prevents its usage for practical application in energy storage. In this work, the CNTs-decorated LiVPO4F/C (CNTs@LiVPO4F/C) nanocomposite has been prepared via a conventional sol-gel approach. The XRD results reveal that all the diffraction peaks obtained for CNTs@LiVPO4F/C are indexed to the triclinic structure. TEM images show that the conductive CNTs are distributed homogeneously over the LiVPO4F/C particles. Benefiting from the enhanced conductivity, the as-prepared CNTs@LiVPO4F/C electrode exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance with high reversible capacity of 121.1 mAh g−1 at a high current rate of 10C. Therefore, the novel CNTs@LiVPO4F/C cathode material developed from this investigation with superior Li-storage performance has promising practical applications in electrochemical energy storage systems.","Yang, Xujiao;Wang, Xianli;Wang, Kaiying;Chang, Guangli",2018-03-31,Ceramics International,"Li-ion batteries,LiVPO4F,Carbon coating,CNTs,Li-storage performance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.168,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.168
Effect of hot-dip siliconizing time on phase composition and microstructure of Mo–MoSi2 high temperature structural materials,"Mo–MoSi2 high temperature structural materials were obtained by hot-dip siliconizing method. The results show that the silicon melt and molybdenum substrate have good wettability, molten silicon reacts with molybdenum substrate to form a molybdenum silicide phase with a columnar structure, and a strong MoSi2 crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) on the (110) crystal face is characterized. While, the Mo–MoSi2 high temperature structural materials consist mainly of silicon rich layer, MoSi2 layer, interface layer and molybdenum substrate. The coating surfaces contain a high silicon concentration (55–65 wt%) than the MoSi2 layer (30–35 wt%). Moreover, the thicknesses and the average grain sizes of siliconized coatings increase sharply with increasing siliconizing time. The coatings thicknesses are 20, 25, 30, and 50 µm, respectively.

Performance study of a Li4Ti5O12 electrode for lithium batteries prepared by atmospheric plasma spraying,"Lithium-ion batteries with spinel Li4Ti5O12 negative electrodes have been recognized as a promising candidate for the future energy storage systems, because of their remarkable rate capability and cycle life performance and inherent safety. However, a simple and low-cost method for preparing LTO electrodes is still needed. In this respect, a LTO electrode was obtained by the atmospheric plasma spray method and was tested in a half-cell. The LTO electrode displays optimal performance, such as good rate capability and excellent cycling stability over 200 cycles at 0.5C. However, as the charge and discharge rates increase, the low coulombic efficiency from capacity decay, which may be due to the polarization of the electrodes, and the collapse of the crystal structure cause an irreversible cycle. The results demonstrate that the APS method has potential in the preparation of electrodes, thereby greatly reducing the cost and simplifying the procedures for preparing electrodes.","Liang, Xinghua;Wang, Yunting;Zhang, Xiaofeng;Han, Di;Lan, Lingxiao;Zhang, Yanhui",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Li4Ti5O12,Atmospheric plasma spraying,Coatings,Plasma gun,LTO electrode",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.091,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.091
Influence of interface structure on microstructure and dielectric properties of bismuth magnesium niobate thin films,"Bismuth magnesium niobate (Bi3/2MgNb3/2O7, BMN) thin films were prepared on bare SiO2/HR-Si and Pt/TiO2/SiO2/HR-Si substrates by using sol-gel spin coating technique followed by rapid thermal annealing process. The influence of the interface on crystalline structure and tunable dielectric properties of the two types of BMN films were investigated. It was found that the BMN films prepared on SiO2/Si substrate with a BMN/SiO2 interface structure had higher orientation and better crystallinity. The deposited BMN thin films with a BMN/SiO2 interface structure exhibited superior tunability of 52.5%, while it showed a relative small tunability value of the film with BMN/Pt interface structure. It suggests that the interface state between the films and substrates, electric field distribution, and orientation degree are responsible for the impacts on the microstructure and tunable dielectric properties of the BMN thin films.","Dong, Helei;Kang, Wenfang;Tan, Qiulin;Zhao, Lihui;Tang, Jun;Duan, Junping;Shi, Feng;Xiong, Jijun",2019-06-01,Ceramics International,"Films,Sol–gel processes,Interfaces,Tunable dielectric properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.051,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.051
Stress design of a laminated MoSi2/Cr coating under particle impact and high temperature environment,"A protective laminated MoSi2/Cr coating was deposited on SiC coated carbon/carbon composites by plasma spraying. Under particle impact environment, the Cr interface layer could relax stress concentration and rapidly relieve impact stress by 30% in the laminated coating layer by layer, thus keeping inner layers intact according to the experiment and simulation results. Under thermal shock condition, sudden change of thermal stress induced by the Cr interface layer could also help change the crack propagation path, thus keeping the coated sample without mass loss after 30 thermal cycles between 1500 °C and room temperature. After 157 h oxidation at 1500 °C in static air, the Cr interface layer could also inhibit the formation of penetrating cracks and convert the oxidation mechanism of parabolic mass loss law in MoSi2 coating to linear mass loss law at the final oxidation stage.","Hu, Dou;Fu, Qiangang;Zhou, Lei;Zhang, Yuyu;Zhang, Guangpeng",2020-06-01,Ceramics International,"C/C composites,Laminated coating,Particle impact resistance,Thermal shock resistance,Stress analysis",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.076,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.076
Structural evolution and high-temperature tribological properties of AlCrON coatings deposited by multi-arc ion plating,"AlCrON coatings were deposited on plasma nitrided steel substrates by multi-arc ion plating under different oxygen flow rates. The surface morphology, structure, composition, mechanical properties, and tribological behavior were investigated systematically. The coating surface roughness increases with increasing oxygen flow rate. The structural analysis show as-deposited coatings exhibit B1 NaCl like solid solution phases, transformed from fcc-(Cr, Al)N to fcc-(Cr, Al)ON followed by fcc-(Cr, Al)2O3 phase structure for coating deposited at the oxygen flow rate of 300 sccm. The hardness and elastic modulus of the coating decrease with increasing oxygen content due to phase transformation. The minimum friction coefficient of 0.52 and the lowest wear rate of 1.57 × 10−16 m3/(N∙m) at 600 °C are obtained for the coating deposited at 150 sccm, which is attributed to the excellent adhesion and thermal stability.","Ahmad, Farooq;Zhang, Lin;Zheng, Jun;Sidra, Iram;Cai, Fei;Zhang, Shihong",2020-10-15,Ceramics International,"AlCrON coating,Multi-arc ion plating,Structure,High-temperature wear",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.208,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.208
Solution-processed semiconducting aluminum-zinc-tin-oxide thin films and their thin-film transistor applications,"We prepared aluminum-zinc-tin-oxide (AZTO) thin films by the solution spin-coating method and investigated their physical and electrical properties according to different incorporated amounts of Al. AZTO films annealed at 400°C were amorphous. Though SnO2 crystallites were detected in films annealed at temperatures higher than 500°C, the number of crystallites decreased as the Al content increased. Thin films had a smooth and uniform surface morphology with an optical transmittance value higher than 92% in the visible range. Electrical conductivity and its temperature dependence varied markedly according to the amount of Al incorporated in the film. We therefore systematically investigated activation energies for carrier transport for each film composition. Thin-film transistors (TFTs) were fabricated using solution-processed AZTO as an active channel layer. The effects of the amount of Al incorporated in the thin film on TFT characteristics were also evaluated. The best device performance was observed for a TFT with a 5mol%-Al-incorporated AZTO channel.

High strength silica-based ceramics material for investment casting applications: Effects of adding nanosized alumina coatings,"A nanosized alumina coating was synthesized on the surface of fused silica particles by electrostatic attraction. The effects of the coated fused silica particles on the cristobalite crystallization behavior, microstructure evolution, and flexural strength of silica-based ceramic cores were investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to characterize phase transformations in the specimens, and the results indicated that the formed nanosized alumina coatings could retard cristobalite formation by inducing compressive stress on the fused silica particle surface. A mullite phase was also found due to the reaction of the nanosized alumina coating and the surface of the fused silica when the sintering temperature was increased to 1300 °C. Analysis using scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM/EDS) suggested that alumina nanoparticles in the coated layer dispersed into a liquid phase and formed a barrier layer to impede the movement of the liquid phase, preventing the pore-filling process and increasing the open porosity of the ceramic specimens. Flexural strengths at room temperature were tested, indicating that increases in the sintering temperature of the specimens without coated fused silica powders had little effect on flexural strength. However, the flexural strength of the specimens with coated fused silica powders increased with increases in sintering temperature. The improvement in flexural strength was related to the reinforcement by sintering necks between particles and the improvement in the strength of the coated fused silica powder.","Chen, Xiao;Liu, Chunyang;Zheng, Wenlong;Han, Jiqing;Zhang, Li;Liu, Chunming",2020-01-31,Ceramics International,"Nanosized alumina coating,Silica-based ceramic core,Cristobalite,Flexural strength",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.248,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.248
PM304 coating on a Ni-based superalloy rod for high temperature lubrication,"PM304 coating on a Ni-based superalloy rod for high temperature lubrication has been prepared by high-energy ball milling and powder metallurgy techniques. The composition of the PM304 coating is the same as that of PS304 coating, but the microstructure is quite different. The microstructure of PM304 coating is fine and dense; the size of self-lubricating particles in the coating is very small. Self-lubricating Cr2O3 particles are about 100nm, BaF2/CaF2 particles about 1μm, Ag particles below 5μm, while BaF2/CaF2 and Ag particles precipitated from NiCr matrix are less than 50nm. The fine and dense microstructure results in increased tensile strength and crack growth resistance of PM304 coating. The mean tensile strength is about 46MPa.","Ding, C.H.;Li, P.L.;Ran, G.;Zhou, J.N.",2008-03-31,Ceramics International,"Milling,Sintering,Composites",10.1016/j.ceramint.2006.09.016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2006.09.016

"Structural, optical and conductivity investigations on κ-Al2O3 ceramics for powder metallurgical production and sensitivity applications","Aluminum oxide (Al2O3) ceramics has been prepared by spray pyrolysis technique. X-ray analysis shows that the prepared thin films crystallize in κ-Al2O3 (kappa-alumina) phase with orthorhombic structure. Also, the crystallites are mainly orientated along (201) direction. The dispersion of the refractive index was discussed in terms of single oscillator model proposed by Wemple and Di-Domenico. The single oscillator energy (E 0) as well as the dispersion energy (Ed ) was therefore calculated. Finally electrical properties were performed using impedance spectroscopy technique in the frequency range 5Hz to 13MHz at various temperatures (300–400°C). DC conductivity was thermally activated, showing a semiconductor behavior of κ-Al2O3 sprayed thin films. Elements from the Lattice Compatibility Theory analyses have been also presented in order to give a plausible understanding for the recorded chlorine/oxygen rapid substitution within AlCl3 lattices. On the other hand AC conductivity was investigated through Jonscher law.

Surface structural features and optical analysis of nanostructured Cu-oxide thin film coatings coated via the sol-gel dip coating method,"Nanostructured thin film coatings of copper oxide (Cu-oxide) were investigated to determine their physical structure, surface morphology, surface electronic bonding states, and optical properties. The Cu-oxide had been coated onto reflective aluminum substrates via a facile one-step sol–gel dip-coating route using a copper nitrate precursor. Characterizations were conducted using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and ultra-violet visible (UV–Vis) spectroscopic methods, and representative sol-gel reactions using copper nitrate precursor were proposed. The XPS spectra confirmed the presence of copper oxide elements. Further exploration of the Cu2p3/2 peak in XPS spectra revealed that the electronic structure of the copper component consisted of tetrahedral Cu(I) and octahedral Cu(II) with the presence of octahedral Cu(II) enabling coatings to have high absorption levels across the solar spectrum. The deconvolution of the O1s spectra exhibited three curve-fitting components: the lattice O2−, surface oxygen, and subsurface O− species. FESEM results showed that the coating surface was an agglomerated copper oxide nanoparticles structure forming a porous structure.

Effect of five kinds of pores shape on thermal stress properties of thermal barrier coatings by finite element method,"Thermal ablation is a very important technique to characterize the thermal properties of coating systems. On account of the concentration of thermal stress, thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) often break off from the substrate partly or completely during the thermal erosion. In this paper, the thermal erosion simulation of finite element geometric models based on the possible pore shapes were implemented, especially, the influence of pore shapes on the distribution of coating temperature, X component of stress, Y component of stress, XY-shear stress and von-Mises stress were focused on. The effects of the different porosity of square pore coatings on thermal insulation properties and thermal stresses were discussed in term of the simulation results. The simulation results indicate that different shape pores not only affect the thermal stress distribution above the contact area between the bond coating and top coating surface, but also affect the plastic deformation behavior of TBCs. The micromechanism was discussed in details in this study. The computed results verified that, the computational method can successfully predict thermal shear, crack initiation and normal failure mode of the studied TBCs. All the results are in good agreement with the corresponding experimental findings. The failure mechanism factors in this paper are of great importance to explain the failure micro-mechanism of TBCs.","Yang, Ming;Zhu, Yongping;Wang, Xueying;Guo, Shengnan;Hu, Jing;Zhao, Lili;Chu, Ying",2017-09-30,Ceramics International,"Shaping,Thermal stress,Failure analysis,Finite element method",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.139,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.139
Synthesis and oxygen permeation properties of Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-d - Sm1-xSrxCu0.2Fe0.8O3-d dual-phase ceramic membranes: effect of Strontium contents and Pd coating layer,"In this study, the effects of the strontium (x = 0.2–0.7) contents on oxygen permeation properties of 60 wt% Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-d − 40 wt% Sm0.8Sr0.2Cu0.2Fe0.8O3-d (SDC-8228) and 60 wt% Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-d − 40 wt% Sm0.3Sr0.7Cu0.2Fe0.8O3-d (SDC-3728) dual-phase (DP) ceramic membranes obtained by one-pot synthesis of a pure Ionic Conducting (IC) phase with a Mixed Ionic–Electronic Conducting (MIEC) phase were investigated under different conditions of temperature (800–1000 °C) and CO2 atmosphere (0–100%). As a result, it was confirmed that the oxygen permeation properties of selected IC/MIEC DP membranes had increased when the Strontium content (Srx) of the MIEC phase increased from Srx = 0.2 to Srx = 0.7. The results showed that the SDC-3728 DP membrane exhibits higher oxygen flux than the SDC-8228 DP membrane. In detail, the oxygen permeation flux reached ∼0.5 mL min−1 cm−2 at 1000 °C, which was about was one and a half times higher than the SDC-8228 DP membrane. An additional performance improvement was achieved by coating the SDC-3728 DP membrane with a pure Electron Conductor (EC) like Palladium (Pd) by the electroless deposition technique. The oxygen permeation flux of the Pd surface-modified SDC-3728 DP membrane was ∼2.0 mL min−1 cm−2 in 100% CO2 at 1000 °C, which was about three times higher than the SDC-8228 DP membrane.","Magnone, Edoardo;Chae, Jinwoong;Park, Jung Hoon",2018-08-01,Ceramics International,"Dual-phase ceramic membrane,MIEC,Strontium content,Surface modification,Oxygen permeation properties,Triple phase boundary",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.110,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.110
Influence of internal oxidation of the bond-coat on the residual stress around the TGO and failure modes of the APS-TBCs: A finite element simulation study,"In this paper, the influence of internal oxidation of the bond-coat on the residual stress around the thermally grown oxide (TGO) and failure modes of the TBCs fabricated by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) has been studied via finite element modeling. Generally, the internal oxidation will occur when the bond-coat (BC) was fabricated by APS. The produced oxide was distributed irregularly at the inner of the bond-coat, and the distribution patterns like some isolated islands, so it was called “island-like” oxide by us. As the BC layer usually consists Ni, Co, Cr, Al and Y etc., the composition of the “island-like” oxide is very complicated due to the formation Gibbs free energy are different when those metallic elements take reaction with exterior [O]. During the subsequent high temperature service conditions, a continuous thin TGO layer will be formed. In addition, the BC layer will be further endured with inner oxidation due to the [O] diffuse to the interface, the mixture oxide will appear below the TGO layer randomly, which will lead to a complicated stress distribution at the TGO/YSZ interface directly. Moreover, a small amount of Cr2O3 was formed in TGO layer, the distribution of interfacial stress was strongly influenced, resulting in complicated fluctuance of interface and unpredictable failure modes simultaneously. So, to systematically discuss the distribution of residual stress state along YSZ/TGO interface, the influence of the composition of TGO and the location of internal oxides on the distribution of interfacial stress were studied via FEM. The results show that with the increase of the percentage of Cr2O3 (wt.%) in TGO, the maximum tensile stress and compressive stress have changed evidently at the peak of TGO. Besides of considering the percentage of Cr2O3 (wt.%) in TGO, the internal oxides existed below the TGO layer have been taken into account simultaneously.","Hu, Z.C.;Wang, L.;Zhuang, M.X.;Zhang, H.Y.;Li, G.S.;Liu, Y.;Wang, Y.;Yang, Y.",2020-10-16,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Finite element modeling,Residual stress,Failure modes,Internal oxidation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.117,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.117
Microstructure and corrosion behaviors of conductive Hf/HfN multilayer coatings on magnesium alloys,"Both high corrosion resistance and electrical conductivity are required for the surface coatings of the magnesium alloys as used in electronics or aerospace applications. In this study, anticorrosive yet conductive Hf/HfN multilayer coatings are deposited on magnesium alloys via magnetron sputtering. The microstructural characterizations reveal that the growth of nano-scale pinholes along with the columnar structure of Hf sublayers have been completely suppressed by introducing the nanocrystalline HfN sublayers. The optimized Hf/HfN multilayer coated magnesium alloy exhibits a positive corrosion potential of − 0.51 V vs SCE and low corrosion current density of 0.01 μA/cm2 in electrochemical system, and few corrosion pits after 48 h salt spray test, while maintaining the fine electronic conductivity similar to magnesium alloy. The desirable performance was attributed to the multilayer structure induced by nanocrystalline HfN interlayer, which resulted in decreased coating porosity, confined pathway and increased energy barrier for corrosion media.","Zhang, Dongfang;Qi, Zhengbing;Wei, Binbin;Shen, Hao;Wang, Zhoucheng",2018-06-01,Ceramics International,"Magnesium alloy,Hf/HfN multilayer coating,Microstructure,Electronical conductivity,Corrosion behaviors",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.027,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.027
Structure-property relationship and design of plasma-sprayed La2Ce2O7/8YSZ composite coatings for gas turbine blades,"Novel lanthanum-cerium oxide/8 wt% yttria partially stabilized zirconia (LC/8YSZ) thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) were deposited by supersonic atmospheric plasma spraying. The thermal insulation temperature and thermal shock resistance of LC/8YSZ double-ceramic-layer TBCs (DCL-TBCs) were quantitatively evaluated by a burner rig test. The results showed that the thermal insulation temperature increased with the increase of LC layer thickness in DCL-TBCs. When the thickness ratio between LC layer and 8YSZ layer was close to 1:1, the DCL-TBCs had the highest thermal shock resistance. LC/8YSZ thickness ratio significantly affected the energy release rate and the stress induced by thermal gradient or sintering. The sintering stress was found to be the main reason that caused the delamination of LC layer, however, the stress induced by thermal gradient resulted in the spallation of YSZ layer.","Liu, Kun;Bai, Yu;Li, Jiarong;Ma, Jun;Du, Jinguang;Cao, Yang;Li, Xiaoke",2018-08-15,Ceramics International,"Lanthanum-cerium oxide,Thermal barrier coatings,Supersonic atmospheric plasma spraying,Stress",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.204,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.204
"Oxidation behavior of (Mo,W)Si2–Si3N4 composite coating on molybdenum substrate at 1600°C","(Mo,W)Si2–Si3N4 composite coating on pure molybdenum (Mo) substrate was prepared by using in situ diffusion of tungsten (W), nitrogen (N) and silicon (Si) elements. The microstructures and phase compositions were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). A coarse columnar crystal structure was observed in the original dense (Mo,W)Si2–Si3N4 layer in the SEM micrographs. The transition layers of (Mo,W)5Si3 and (Mo,W)3Si were formed between the coating and Mo substrate during a oxidation process at 1600°C in air. The growth kinetics of (Mo,W)5Si3 transition layer in (Mo,W)Si2–Si3N4 coating obeyed a parabolic rate law and its growth rate constant was 7.22×10−10 cm2/s. The strong hindering effect of W element in coating on the Si diffusion led to a longer antioxidation life of the (Mo,W)Si2–Si3N4 coating on Mo substrate at1600°C.","Zhang, Houan;Lv, Jianxian;Wu, Yihui;Gu, Siyong;Huang, Yu;Chen, Ying",2015-12-31,Ceramics International,"B.

As far as we know, this is the first time that the preparation of asymmetric BSCF structures by the co-use of these two methods is reported in the literature. These materials have attracted a great attention over the past years because they can transport both ions and electrons, and are commonly used as dense mixed ionic-electronic conducting membranes. A homogeneous top layer was observed for freeze-cast supports prepared from slurries containing either 50 or 60wt% BSCF loading. No apparent pores or cracks were observed through the top layer thickness, suggesting that these samples may show a gas selective behavior.

ZrO2-coated Li3V2(PO4)3/C nanocomposite: A high-voltage cathode for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries with remarkable cycling performance,"In this study, we show that the poor cycling performance which seriously hinders the application of Li3V2(PO4)3/C for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries is overcome by amorphous ZrO2 nano-coating. The ZrO2-coated Li3V2(PO4)3/C was synthesized via a conventional solid-state method followed by the application of wet coating.

Reduced thermal conductivity of solid solution of 20% CeO2 + ZrO2 and 8% Y2O3 + ZrO2 prepared by atmospheric plasma spray technique,"To reduce the thermal conductivity and improve the durability of ZrO2 based materials, coatings from different contents of 20% CeO2 + ZrO2 and 8% Y2O3 + ZrO2 are deposited by atmospheric plasma spray technique. The obtained coatings are characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and the thermal diffusivity/conductivity is calculated. Substitutional point defects are created in the coating which improves the phonon scattering thereby influencing the thermal conductivity. Pores and cracks are identified in the microstructure and quantitatively analyzed. Samples with higher concentration of defects provided minimum thermal conductivity which might be due to the enhanced phonon scattering.

Niobo-phosphate bioactive glass films produced by pulsed laser deposition on titanium surfaces for improved cell adhesion,"Implant bioactivity is related to its ability to stimulate the adjacent bone tissue to create strong and direct chemical bonds with its surface, reducing implant failure and total rehabilitation time. Surface treatments are a way to obtain such surface properties. In this work, niobo-phosphate bioactive glass thin films were produced by pulsed laser deposition with two different laser pulse energies (50 and 100 mJ). The chemical composition, crystallinity, surface morphology, and wettability of the films was investigated. In addition, proliferation and cell morphology tests were also performed to evaluate the cell behaviour and cell-surface interaction with these coatings in comparison with pure titanium surface. The deposited films presented an amorphous structure. Target and films showed the same chemical composition. Coated surface showed higher wettability, with lower contact angles, suggesting a hydrophilicity of the samples. In vitro assays presented an increase in the cell number after the first 48 h at the surface coated with higher energy (100 mJ) and a better cell morphology, when focal contact points, cell size and organization of the stress fibers were taking into account. As a conclusion, same chemical composition was observed at target and films and also could be suggested that the coated surfaces, especially the ones with higher energy presented better surface properties and cellular behaviour than the control samples.","Sanz, Carolina Kaminski;dos Santos, Aline Raybolt;da Silva, Marcelo Henrique Prado;Marçal, Rubens;Tute, Elena Mavropoulos;Meza, Elvis Lopez;Mello, Alexandre;Borghi, Fabricio Frizera;de Souza Camargo, Sergio Alvaro",2019-10-01,Ceramics International,"Niobium-phosphate,Bioglass,Pulsed laser deposition,Bioactive glass,Cell adhesion,Bioactive coatings",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.025
Effect of PyC interphase thickness on mechanical and ablation properties of 3D Cf/ZrC–SiC composite,"Three-dimensional (3D) Cf/ZrC–SiC composites were successfully prepared by the polymer infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP) process using polycarbosilane (PCS) and a novel ZrC precursor. The effects of PyC interphase of different thicknesses on the mechanical and ablation properties were evaluated. The results indicate that the Cf/ZrC–SiC composites without and with a thin PyC interlayer of 0.15µm possess much poor flexural strength and fracture toughness. The flexural strength grows with the increase of PyC layer thickness from 0.3 to 1.2µm. However, the strength starts to decrease with the further increase of the PyC coating thickness to 2.2µm. The highest flexural strength of 272.3±29.0MPa and fracture toughness of 10.4±0.7MPam1/2 were achieved for the composites with a 1.2µm thick PyC coating. Moreover, the use of thicker PyC layer deteriorates the ablation properties of the Cf/ZrC–SiC composites slightly and the ZrO2 scale acts as an anti-ablation component during the testing.","Yan, Chunlei;Liu, Rongjun;Zhang, Changrui;Cao, Yingbin",2016-08-15,Ceramics International,"Cf/ZrC–SiC,PyC interphase,Mechanical properties,Ablation properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.187,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.187
Double-layer TC4/Sr substituted hydroxyapatite bioactive coating for carbon/carbon composites,"Double-layer TC4/Sr substituted hydroxyapatite bioactive coatings were applied on carbon/carbon composites using a combination method of magnetron sputtering and ultrasound-assisted electrochemical deposition (UED). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were adopted to investigate the morphology, microstructure and composition of the coating. The in vitro bioactivity of the coating was investigated using simulated body fluid (SBF) and cell culture tests. The results showed that the double-layer TC4/Sr substituted hydroxyapatite bioactive coatings were successfully applied on carbon/carbon composites. The deposition of TC4 inner layer was induced by the arrangement of the carbon fiber in carbon/carbon composites. The Sr substituted hydroxyapatite out layer formed a porous three-dimensional network structure with a pore size ranging from 15nm to 400nm after UED for 1min and then exhibited a dense structure after UED for 2h. The SBF immersion tests showed that the double-layer TC4/Sr substituted hydroxyapatite coating could induce the formation of a uniform apatite layer in SBF. The cell culture experiment showed that the cells were favorably elongated and flattened with plenty of filopods and microvilli on the double-layer coating, exhibiting excellent cell activity and cell proliferation behavior.","Leilei, Zhang;Hejun, Li;Kezhi, Li;Shouyang, Zhang;Qiangang, Fu;Yulei, Zhang;Shoujie, Liu",2015-01-31,Ceramics International,"Sr substituted hydroxyapatite,Carbon/carbon composites,Cell,Coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.08.087,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.08.087
Influence of yttria-alumina surface coating on the colloidal processing of silicon nitride slips,"Silicon nitride (Si3N4) powders coated with 6 wt.% Y2O3 and 4 wt.% Al2O3 were prepared by coprecipitation. For comparison, the Si3N4 powder containing the same amount of additives was also prepared by mechanical mixing. The resulting powders were dispersed in water with ammonium polyacrylate (NH4PA) to produce 32 vol.% slips. The influence of pH on the dispersion properties of 32 vol.% coated Si3N4 slips with NH4PA were investigated and compared with those of the mixed Si3N4 slips. The microstructure and density of green cast samples were determined and related to the degree of slip dispersion. In addition, the influence of the surface coating of Si3N4 on the sintering behavior was investigated. Lower viscosity values of the coated Si3N4 slips were found in the pH range studied. The better slip dispersion of the coated Si3N4 slips resulted in higher green density values. A linear correlation between the sintered density and the green density was found. The densification and the α- to -β phase transformation of Si3N4 were not affected and enhanced, respectively, with the surface coating of Si3N4 particles with sintering aids.","Albano, Marı́a P.;Garrido, Liliana B.",2003-12-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Properties of heat resistant hollow glass microsphere/phosphate buoyancy materials with different coatings,"The heat resistant buoyancy materials were fabricated by the molding method using the aluminum dihydric phosphate as the matrix and hollow glass microspheres as the filler, respectively. In order to improve the waterproof performance of the buoyancy, two strategies, adding the B4C additives and introducing the silica-based coatings, were adopted. The study showed that the samples with the B4C content of 10 wt% possessed the optimal comprehensive performance, such as low density (0.540 g/cm3) and low water absorption (29.6%). The effect of the coating types and coating times on the density, water absorption, compressive strength and specific strength of the buoyancy materials were also studied. After 4 times of coating, the density and the compressive strength of the sample increased to 0.62 g/cm3 and 6.0 MPa, respectively; the water absorption of the samples greatly decreased to 10%. Besides, all samples exhibited significant pseudoductility. The buoyancy materials with the above superior properties can be potentially used in the deep see fields.","Dong, Xue;Wang, Mingchao;Tao, Xin;Liu, Jiachen;Guo, Anran",2020-01-31,Ceramics International,"Buoyancy materials,B4C additive,Coatings,Microstructure,Strength,Water absorption",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.277,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.277
Pulsed electrodeposition of carbon nanotubes-hydroxyapatite nanocomposites for carbon/carbon composites,"Carbon nanotubes-hydroxyapatite (CNTs-HA) composite coatings, which behaved like single composites, were synthesized by a combined method composed of electrophoretic deposition and pulsed electrodeposition. The phase compositions and the microstructure of the composite coatings were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR). Potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies showed that the CNTs-HA composite coatings protected the bare carbon/carbon composites from corrosion in simulated body fluid (SBF) solution. The adhesion strength of CNTs-HA composite coating prepared by the combined method is 14.57±1.06MPa achieved at the CNTs EPD time of 10min. Compared to the other CNTs-HA composite coatings with different content of CNTs, the CNT-HA composite coating with the electrophoretic deposition of 10min showed the best corrosion resistance. The morphology of CNTs-HA composite coatings immersed in SBF solution rendered the formation of HA crystallites. In addition, in vitro cellular responses to the CNTs-HA composite coatings were assessed to investigate the proliferation and morphology of mouse cells 3T3 cell line.","Liu, Shoujie;Li, Hejun;Zhang, LeiLei;Guo, Qian",2016-11-01,Ceramics International,"Hydroxyapatite,Carbon nanotubes,Pulsed electrodeposition,Wear,Biocompatibility",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.020,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.020
Tuning the interface by a soldering method for high performance garnet-type solid-state Li metal battery,"Garnet-type solid electrolytes are promising lithium (Li) ion conductors for all-solid-state batteries. However, their poor compatibilities towards Li metal due to their inherently lithiophobic properties severely hinder their practical application in garnet-based solid-state Li metal batteries (SSLBs). Here, we demonstrated a soldering method to modify the surface of garnet ceramic by forming a thin artificial sulfur layer, which results in a homogeneous and stable Li/solid electrolyte interface. This artificial interface effectively enhances the compatibility between the garnet-type solid electrolyte and the Li metal anode. Consequently, the interfacial resistance of sulfur-coated garnet electrolyte is significantly reduced from 1750 Ω cm2 to 160 Ω cm2 based on the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements on Li symmetric cells. Besides, the symmetric cell exhibits an excellent lifetime of more than 1100 h at a steady state of voltage hysteresis, which indicates a stable and dendrite-free garnet/Li metal interface. The fabricated Li|garnet|LiCoO2 SSLB using this novel interfacial treatment delivers a high specific capacity of 126 mAh g−1 and good cycling stability.","Zheng, Shu;Fu, Zheng;Dai, Dongju;Zhao, Weimin",2019-06-15,Ceramics International,"Garnet/Li metal interface,Sulfur,Spray coating,Low temperature soldering,Symmetric cell,Solid state batteries",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.088,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.088
Investigation of Tb-doping on structural transition and multiferroic properties of BiFeO3 thin films,"Pure BiFeO3 (BFO) and Bi1−x Tb x FeO3 (BTFO) thin films were successfully prepared on FTO (fluorine doped tin oxide) substrates by the sol–gel spin-coating method. The effects of Tb-doping on the structural transition, leakage current, and dielectric and multiferroic properties of the BTFO thin films have been investigated systematically. XRD, Rietveld refinement and Raman spectroscopy results clearly reveal that a structural transition occurs from the rhombohedral (R3c:H) to the biphasic structure (R3c:H+R-3m:R) with Tb-doping. The leakage current density of BTFO x=0.10 thin film is two orders lower than that of the pure BFO, i.e. 5.1×10−7 A/cm2 at 100kV/cm. Furthermore, the electrical conduction mechanism of the BTFO thin films is dominated by space-charge-limited conduction. The two-phase coexistence of BTFO x=0.10 gives rise to the superior ferroelectric (2P r=135.1μC/cm2) and the enhanced ferromagnetic properties (M s=6.3emu/cm3). The optimal performance of the BTFO thin films is mainly attributed to the biphasic structure and the distorted deformation of FeO6 octahedra.","Dong, Guohua;Tan, Guoqiang;Luo, Yangyang;Liu, Wenlong;Ren, Huijun;Xia, Ao",2014-06-30,Ceramics International,"BiFeO3 thin films,Tb-doping,Structural transition,Multiferroic properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.11.089,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.11.089
Interfacial interaction and roughness parameters effects on the residual stresses in DCL-TBC system with different thickness distributions,"Compared with the traditional Single-Ceramic-Layer Thermal Barrier Coating system (SCL-TBCs), the application of the Double-Ceramic-Layers Thermal Barrier Coating system (DCL-TBCs) can strengthen the thermal insulation performance and ameliorate the interfacial oxidation behavior. The residual stresses due to the mismatch of thermal expansion, are so important that they can lead to the spallation and delamination failure of the entire system. In present work, considering the evolution of failure positions in the DCL-TBCs, the effects of interfacial interaction and roughness parameters on the residual stresses were investigated under two different thickness distributions of the ceramic layer. Therein, the numerical models with the general periodic boundary have been developed. Results show that the morphology of the yttria partially stabilized zirconia (YSZ)/thermally grown oxide (TGO) interface can affect the stress distribution along the lanthanum zirconate (LZ)/YSZ interface in the TBCs with low thickness of YSZ, but this influence can be negligible if the YSZ is thick enough. The qualitative distribution of the residual stress along the LZ/YSZ interface is similar for various interfacial roughness parameters, and the maximum tensile stress is always presented at the peak of the LZ/YSZ interface. But for the YSZ/TGO interface, the increase in the roughness parameters can lead to the change of the maximum tensile stress position and even the transition of the stress state in the local region. Also, as the reference for judging the maximum tensile stress location, the critical wavelength was obtained based on the parametric calculation procedure, and the relationship between the critical wavelength and the YSZ/TGO interface amplitude has also been revealed. Moreover, the analysis results can also help to understand the failure mechanisms of the DCL-TBCs and provide a reference for further process optimization.","Chen, Qi;Hu, Peng;Pu, Jian;Zhang, Tiao;Wang, Jian Hua",2020-09-15,Ceramics International,"The DCL-TBCs,Numerical simulation,Residual stress,Interfacial interaction,Failure mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.132,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.132
Fabrication and microstructure of Al2O3TiO2 composite membranes with ultrafine pores,"A ceramic membrane consisting of an α-Al2O3 support and an Al2O3 TiO2 top layer, which is thermally stable up to 900 °C, was prepared by the solgel method. The supported Al2O3TiO2 top layer was made by dip-coating the support in a mixed sol. The microstructure of the composite membranes was studied by SEM and TEM after calcination at 850–1000 °C. After sintering at 850 °C for 1 h, the average particle diameter of the Al2O3TiO2 top layer was about 15 nm. The supported Al2O3TiO2 composite membranes exhibited much higher heat resistance than the TiO2 membranes. Although significant grain growth was observed for the TiO2 membrane after heating above 700 °C due to phase transformation, the Al2O3TiO2 composite membrane retained a crackfree microstructure and narrow particle size distribution even after calcination up to 900 °C.","Bae, Dong-Sik;Cheong, Deock-Soo;Han, Kyong-Sop;Choi, Sang-Hael",1998-12-31,Ceramics International,"composite membrane,Al2O3TiO2,sol-gel method,thermal stability",10.1016/S0272-8842(96)00072-7,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0272-8842(96)00072-7
Antibacterial activity and corrosion resistance of Ta2O5 thin film and electrospun PCL/MgO-Ag nanofiber coatings on biodegradable Mg alloy implants,"Biodegradable magnesium (Mg) alloys have drawn considerable attention for use in orthopedic implants, but their antibacterial activity and corrosion resistance still require improvement. In the present work, functional Ta2O5 (tantalum pentoxide) compact layers and PCL/MgO-Ag (poly (ε-caprolactone)/magnesium oxide-silver) nanofiber porous layers were subsequently deposited on Mg alloys via reactive magnetron sputtering and electrospinning, respectively, to improve anticorrosion and antibacterial performance. Sputter coating of the Ta2O5 resulted in a thick layer (∼1 μm) with an amorphous structure and high adhesive strength. The nanostructure exhibited bubble-like patterns with no obvious nano-cracks, nano-porosities, or pinholes. The electrospun PCL/MgO-Ag nanofiber coating was porous, smooth, and plain with no obvious beads. In vitro corrosion tests demonstrated the PCL/MgO-Ag nanofiber-coated alloy had greater corrosion resistance than a Ta2O5 sputter-coated alloy or uncoated Mg alloy. The additional electrospun PCL/MgO-Ag nanofiber coating also had greater antibacterial behavior toward Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria than the Ta2O5-coated or uncoated alloy specimens. Increasing the MgO-Ag concentration of the nanofibers from 1 to 3 wt% increased antibacterial activity. The combination of Ta2O5 and PCL/MgO-Ag nanofiber coatings on Mg alloys may therefore have potential applications for reducing bone infection as related to orthopedic implants for bone repair.","Bakhsheshi-Rad, Hamid Reza;Ismail, Ahmad Fauzi;Aziz, Madzlan;Hadisi, Zhina;Omidi, Mahdi;Chen, Xiongbiao",2019-06-15,Ceramics International,"Antibacterial properties,Corrosion behavior,Mg alloy implants,Magnetron sputtering,Electrospinning",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.071,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.071
Effect of pH and carbon nanotube content on the corrosion behavior of electrophoretically deposited chitosan–hydroxyapatite–carbon nanotube composite coatings,"In the first stage, chitosan (CH)–hydroxyapatite (HA)-multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composite coatings were synthesized by electrophoretic deposition technique (EPD) on 316L stainless steel substrates at different levels of pH and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, FTIR and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). A smooth distribution of HA and MWCNT particles in a chitosan matrix with strong interfacial bonding was obtained. In the next stage, effects of pH and MWCNT content of the suspension on the corrosion behavior and deposition mechanism were studied. Potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) curves revealed that increasing pH level of the suspension increases the corrosion protection properties of the deposited composite coating in simulated body fluid (SBF). Furthermore, Nyquist plots showed that increasing MWCNT content of the suspension resulted in higher amounts of R p , but because of the capillary properties of MWCNTs and degradability of the chitosan matrix, corrosion protection level of the coatings containing HA–CH–MWCNT was lower than those of coatings containing solely HA–CH. Amperometric curves in different pH levels of the suspension revealed that the system is diffusion controlled at elevated pH values.","Batmanghelich, Farhad;Ghorbani, Mohammad",2013-07-31,Ceramics International,"Electrophoretic deposition,pH level,Chitosan,MWCNT",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.12.046,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.12.046
Investigation of the tribological and biomechanical properties of CrAlTiN and CrN/NbN coatings on SST 304,"This study examines the influence of thin layer coatings of CrAlTiN and CrN/NbN, deposited via physical vapor, on the biocompatibility, mechanical, tribological, and corrosion properties of stainless steel 304. The microstructure and morphology of the thin CrAlTiN and CrN/NbN layers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), EDX, and X-ray diffraction. The pin on disc wear test was performed on bare and metal-nitride coated SST 304 under a 15N load at 60rpm and showed that the wear rates of the thin CrAlTiN and CrN/NbN film coatings were lower than the bare substrate wear ratio. The coefficients of friction (COFs) attained were 0.64, 0.5, and 0.55 for the bare substrate, CrN/NbN coating, and CrAlTiN coating, respectively. Nano indentation tests were also performed on CrAlTiN-coated and CrN/NbN-coated SST 304. The nanohardnesses and Young's moduli of the coated substrates were 28GPa and 390GPa (CrN/NbN-coated) and 33GPa and 450GPa (CrA1TiN-coated), respectively. For comparison, the nanohardness and Young's modulus of the uncoated substrate were 4.8GPa and 185GPa, respectively. Corrosion tests were conducted, and the behaviors of the bare and metal nitride-deposited substrates were studied in CaCl2 for seven days. The corrosion Tafel test results showed that the metal-nitride coatings offer proper corrosion resistance and can protect the substrate against penetration of CaCl2 electrolyte. The CrN/NbN-coated substrates showed better corrosion resistance compared to the CrAlTiN-coated ones. In evaluating the biocompatibility of the CrAlTiN and CrN/NbN coatings, the human cell line MDA-MB-231 was found to attach and proliferate well on the surfaces of the two coatings.","Huang, W.;Zalnezhad, E.;Musharavati, Farayi;Jahanshahi, P.",2017-08-01,Ceramics International,"Biomaterials,Biocompatibility,Corrosion,SST 304,Wear,Nanoindentation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.081,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.081
Fluorine-free propionate route for the chemical solution deposition of YBa2Cu3O7−x superconducting films,"The environmentally friendly fluorine-free propionate chemical solution deposition route has been developed for the epitaxial growth of YBa2Cu3O7−x (YBCO) superconducting films. In the present work, metal acetates are used as reagents to prepare a YBCO fluorine-free precursor solution. In order to determine the thermal decomposition behavior, the precursor powder obtained by drying the precursor solution was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis coupled with mass spectrometry and differential thermal analyses. The precursor films were deposited on SrTiO3 single crystal substrates by spin coating and subjected to a single-step thermal treatment. Fourier Transformed Infrared spectroscopy was used to study the decomposition of the films. The films have been structurally and morphologically characterized by X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy, respectively, and the superconducting properties have been measured by SQUID.

Comparative study on the corrosion and wear behavior of plasma-sprayed vs. high velocity oxygen fuel-sprayed Al8Si20BN ceramic coatings,"Corrosion and wear are common problems encountered in the oil and gas industry. These entail the gradual destruction of materials by mechanical action on the opposite surface, and the chemical and/or electrochemical reaction with their environment. In this research, Al8Si20BN ceramic powder with specific properties against corrosion and wear was selected, and it was sprayed with high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) and plasma spray methods onto carbon steel substrates. The coatings were characterized with respect to phase composition, microstructure, microhardness and adhesion strength. Their wear behavior was inspected by applying 5, 10, 15 and 20 N loads by pin-on-disc machine, after which the results of both methods were compared. According to the results, the HVOF-coated models were more durable than the plasma-coated models under different loads in the same condition. In addition, the corrosion deterioration of the coated specimens in both brine (3.5% NaCl) and fossil oil were tested for one month (30 days). Potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) assessment in 3.5% NaCl solution indicated that the HVOF-sprayed specimens had better corrosion protection than the plasma-sprayed specimens. Generally, the HVOF technique facilitated more durable coats with greater corrosion and tribological resistance compared to the plasma coating technique.","Zavareh, Mitra Akhtari;Doustmohammadi, Ehsan;Sarhan, Ahmed A.D.M;Karimzadeh, Ramin;Moozarm Nia, Pooria;Al/Kulpid Singh, Ramesh Singh",2018-08-01,Ceramics International,"HVOF ceramic coating,Plasma ceramic coating,Wear resistance,Electrochemical test,Gas and oil manufacture",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.275,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.275
"Microstructural, mechanical and thermal characteristics of zirconia-based thermal barrier coatings deposited by plasma spraying","Ceramic thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are potential tools to increase the durability of metal parts operating in turbine engines. In this work, partially yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and lanthanum zirconate (LZ) coatings were deposited by plasma spraying on stainless steel substrates. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed that plasma spraying promoted the formation of metastable phases in both the cases. Both YSZ and LZ coatings exhibited porous microstructure with a network of embedded pores and microcracks, that resulted in similar porosity values. The average microhardness of LZ coating was about 92% of that of YSZ one (5.4 against 5.9GPa), whereas the thermal expansion coefficient (CTE) of LZ coating was about 86% of that of YSZ one.

Passivation of Al2O3-based refractories by air-plasma-sprayed coatings of Y2O3 to suppress reaction with gaseous Cs,"A simple way to use a commercial Al2O3-based refractory in a sintering furnace was developed for the head-end system in pyroprocessing. The key was to suppress the intrinsic chemical reactivity of the mullite phase in a refractory with gaseous Cs released from spent fuel in a sintering furnace. Owing to the excellent thermodynamic and thermal stability of Y2O3, it was deposited on commercial refractories as air-plasma-sprayed coatings. The coated samples maintained their physical integrity without severe delamination after repeated heat treatment at 1450°C for 12h in an atmosphere of Ar and 4% H2. The chemical reactivity of the coated samples was also confirmed to be satisfactory through a reaction experiment using Cs2CO3 powder. In addition, the coated surfaces were resistant against accidental contamination owing to the formation of non-Cs-reactive yttrium silicate rather than Cs-reactive mullite.","Jeon, Sang-Chae;Lee, Jae-Won;Yoon, Joo-Young;Cho, Yung-Zun;Hur, Jin-Mok",2017-12-01,Ceramics International,"E.

Superhydrophobic surface decorated with vertical ZnO nanorods modified by stearic acid,"Static and dynamic wettability of the ZnO nanorod surface prepared by a facile and inexpensive route is reported. The wettability of the ZnO surface was controlled and tuned by post hydrophobization using different stearic acid concentrations. The surface of the ZnO nanorods modified with 8mM stearic acid showed a static water contact angle of 152° and sliding angle of 9°, which indicates superhydrophobicity. This suggests that the combination of the rough structures achieved by the ZnO nanorods and low surface energy provided by stearic acid modification results in superhydrophobicity and a very low sliding angle. The crystal structure, surface chemical elements, surface morphology, surface roughness, and static and dynamic water contact angles of the ZnO coatings were studied in detail. Further, the surface properties were assessed by calculating the surface free energies and work of adhesion for unmodified and stearic-acid-modified ZnO nanostructure surfaces. These coatings can find potential industrial applications in the electronic industry.","Gurav, Annaso B.;Latthe, Sanjay S.;Vhatkar, Rajiv S.;Lee, Jong-Gun;Kim, Do-Yeon;Park, Jung-Jae;Yoon, Sam S.",2014-06-30,Ceramics International,"Sol–gel,Dip coating,Superhydrophobic,Self-cleaning,Surface free energy",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.12.052,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.12.052
The microstructure evolution in a SiCf/SiC composite under triple ion beam irradiation,"Simultaneous H, He and Fe ion beam irradiations were conducted on a pyrolytic carbon (PyC) - SiCf/SiC composite at 475 °C with the peak displacement damage level up to 47 dpa and concentrations of He and H up to 38 and 3400 appm, What respectively. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy was used to study the evolution of microstructure after the triple beam irradiation. Results show that the interface between SiC fiber and PyC interphase cracked after the triple ion beam irradiation. The PyC interphase could infiltrate into the multilayer SiC coating to cause deformation of the multilayer due to volume expansion. After irradiation, no obvious cavities were observed in multilayer SiC coating and SiC matrix, while He bubbles as large as 15 nm in diameters were observed at the peak displacement damage region in the SiC fiber and SiC coating/PyC interface. Hydrogen promotes nucleation and growth of He bubbles by reducing their surface energy. The formation process of cavities at the interface between PyC interphase and multilayer SiC coating is discussed.","Ye, Chao;Xue, Jiaxiang;Liu, Tong;Shu, Rui;Yan, Yan;Liao, Yehong;Ren, Qisen;Ran, Guang;Sun, Kai;Jiang, Li;Xiu, Pengyuan;Wang, Lumin",2020-05-31,Ceramics International,"SiCf/SiC composites,Ion irradiation,Microstructure,Cavities",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.266,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.266

The fine BZCY powder was prepared by a co-precipitation method. The Ni–BZCY anode tube was fabricated by an extrusion process. Ni–BZCY/BZCY nanocomposite slurry was coated on the anode tube as an anode fuctional layer (AFL) by using the dip-coating method.

The ohmic resistance and the polarization resistance of the BZCY electrolyte were about 0.78Ωcm2 and 0.035Ωcm2 at 700°C, respectively.

Sol–gel preparation and characterization of calcium modified lead titanate (PCT) thin films,"Thin ferroelectric films of calcium modified lead titanate Pb1−x Ca x TiO3 where x=0.28 (72:28) (PCT) are prepared by sol–gel spin coating process on ITO coated corning glass 7059 substrates. Sol–gel technology offers attractive features such as low processing temperature and ease of tailoring of the structural and electrical properties by controlling the composition of the films. Films are prepared using lead acetate trihydrate, calcium acetate hydrate and titanium isopropoxide as precursors, along with 2-methoxy ethanol as solvent and acetic acid as catalyst. Characterization of these films by X-ray diffraction show that the films exhibit tetragonal structure with perovskite phase. Replacement of calcium at Pb site in lead titanate results in reduction of tetragonal ratio (c/a), thus resulting in better electrical and ferroelectric properties. Atomic force microscope (AFM) images are characterized by slight surface roughness with a uniform crack free, densely packed structure. Dielectric, pyroelectric and ferroelectric studies carried out on these films have been reported and discussed. PCT shows fairly high voltage responsivity and appreciable detectivity. Moreover, its high value of remanent polarization (∼28μC/cm2) along with small value of coercive field (∼110kV/cm) makes it a better suited material for non-volatile memory applications.","Chopra, Sonalee;Sharma, Seema;Goel, T.C.;Mendiratta, R.G.",2004-12-31,Ceramics International,"A.

"Effect of thickness on the structure, composition and properties of titanium nitride nano-coatings","Titanium nitride (TiN x ) coatings were grown by magnetron sputtering onto Si(100) substrates by varying time of deposition to produce coatings with variable thickness (d TiN) in the range of 20–120nm. TiN x coatings were characterized by studying their structure, composition, and mechanical properties. Nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) combined with Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) analyses indicate that the grown coatings were stoichiometric TiN. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements indicate that the texturing of TiN coatings changes as a function of d TiN. The (111) and (002) peaks appear initially; (111) becomes intense while (002) disappears with increasing d TiN. Dense, columnar grain structure was evident for all the coatings in electron microscopy analyses. The residual stress for TiN coatings with d TiN~120nm was 1.07GPa in compression while thinner samples exhibit higher values of stress.","Martinez, G.;Shutthanandan, V.;Thevuthasan, S.;Chessa, J.F.;Ramana, C.V.",2014-05-31,Ceramics International,"TiN,Coatings,Structure,RBS,Residual stress",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.11.014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.11.014
Surface properties of new green building material after TiO2–SiO2 coatings deposition,"The aim of this study was the surface functionalization of a new green ceramic material, obtained using packaging glass waste (PGW), to improve its cleanability. This objective was reached through the deposition by air-brushing of a nanostructured coating based on titania–silica sol–gel suspension. The coatings were deposited on both glazed and unglazed ceramic substrates and the thermal treatment conditions (temperature) were optimized. The obtained results suggest that the applied coatings are transparent and show a good scratch resistance and photocatalitic activity under the tested conditions. The photodegradation process and the mechanical properties are clearly affected by the thermal treatment and thus by the sample surface roughness. The best surface properties were obtained with a thermal treatment at temperature of 150°C. These coatings do not exhibit either cracks from the substrate. All in all, the developed surface modified ceramic material is attractive as potential sustainable building material.","Taurino, Rosa;Barbieri, Luisa;Bondioli, Federica",2016-03-31,Ceramics International,"A.

"Comparison of the effect of sintering on the microstructure, micro hardness and phase composition of conventional and nanostructured YSZ TBCs","This paper reports on a study that investigated the effect of sintering on the microstructure, thermal properties and phase composition of nanostructured and conventional 8YSZ thermal barrier coatings. For this purpose, conventional and nanostructured YSZ coatings were heated at 1100°C in an atmospheric box furnace for 10, 20, 50, 100, and 150h. Optical microscope and FE-SEM were used for microstructural studies and XRD was used for phase analysis. The percent of pores and micro hardness were used as measures of sintering. According to the findings, the percent of pores and cracks decreased because of the inter-diffusion of splats. Changes in properties, such as thermal conductivity and micro hardness, during the sintering process were less significant for nanostructured coatings than they were for the conventional ones, but phase changes were more noticeable. XRD investigation showed that picks shift for both samples were the same. The findings showed that using nanostructured coatings could be a way of reducing sintering effects.","Qazi Lavasani, H.;Valefi, Z.;Ehsani, N.;Tamaddon Masoule, S.",2017-10-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,Sintering,Nanostructured coating,Plasma spray",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.120,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.120
Pulsed Electron Deposition of nanostructured bioactive glass coatings for biomedical applications,"Due to poor mechanical properties and brittleness of bioactive glasses, the deposition of bioactive glass coatings on bioinert metallic implants for bone regeneration is a promising route to combine the high bioactivity of the glassy phase with the mechanical strength of metallic substrate. The Pulsed Electron Deposition (PED) technique has been recently demonstrated to be an effective method to fabricate highly-adherent and nanostructured bioactive thin films and coatings, with fine control over film composition. In this paper, we investigated the deposition by PED of 45S5 Bioglass® and of a novel CaO-rich bioactive glass, also containing potassium oxide. Composition, microstructure, surface morphology, wettability and adhesion to the titanium substrate were assessed for both as-deposited and annealed coatings. All samples exhibited a nanostructured surface morphology and high hydrophilicity, both positive features for biological applications. In particular, annealed samples exhibited increased roughness and adhesion degree to the titanium substrate compared to the as-deposited ones. The results showed in this paper suggest that bioactive glass coatings deposited by PED are promising for being further investigated as bioactive coatings for bone implants.","Bellucci, Devis;Bianchi, Michele;Graziani, Gabriela;Gambardella, Alessandro;Berni, Matteo;Russo, Alessandro;Cannillo, Valeria",2017-12-01,Ceramics International,"Plasma-assisted deposition,Bioactive glasses,Nanostructured coatings,Bone implants,Atomic force microscropy,Adhesion tests",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.159,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.159
Effects of post-sintering annealing on the microstructure and toughness of hot-pressed SiCf/SiC composites with Al2O3-Y2O3 additions,"This study examined the effects of post-sintering heat treatment on enhancing the toughness of SiCf/SiC composites. Commercially available Tyranno® SiC fabrics with contiguous dual ‘PyC (inner)-SiC (outer)’ coatings deposited on the SiC fibers were infiltrated with a SiC + 10wt% Al2O3-Y2O3 slurry by electrophoretic deposition. SiC green tapes were stacked between the slurry-infiltrated fabrics to control the matrix volume fraction. Densification of approximately 94% ρtheo was achieved by hot pressing at 1750°C, 20MPa for 2h in an Ar atmosphere. Sintered composites were then subjected to isothermal annealing treatment at 1100, 1250, 1350, and 1750°C for 5h in Ar. The correlation between the flexural behavior and microstructure was explained in terms of the in situ-toughened matrix, phase evolution in the sintering additive, role of dual interphases and observed fracture mechanisms. Extensive fractography analysis revealed interfacial debonding at the hybrid interfaces and matrix cracking as the key fracture modes, which were responsible for the toughening behavior in the annealed SiCf/SiC composites.","Fitriani, Pipit;Yoon, Dang-Hyok;Sharma, Amit Siddharth",2017-11-30,Ceramics International,"Ceramic matrix composites,SiC,Flexural strength,Toughness and toughening",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.031,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.031
Failure analysis of thermally cycled columnar thermal barrier coatings produced by high-velocity-air fuel and axial-suspension-plasma spraying: A design perspective,"Axial-suspension-plasma spraying (ASPS) is a fairly recent thermal spray technology which enables production of ceramic top coats in TBCs, incorporating simultaneously the properties of both the conventional-plasma sprayed (highly insulating porous structures) and electron-beam-physical-vapor-deposited (strain-tolerant columnar structures) top coats. TBCs are required to insulate the hot components in a gas turbine engine against high temperature and harsh operating conditions. Periodic heating and cooling of turbine engines during operation can create severe thermal cyclic fatigue conditions which can degrade the performance of these coatings eventually leading to the failure. An in-depth experimental investigation was performed to understand the failure behavior of columnar TBCs subjected to thermal cyclic fatigue (TCF) test at 1100ᵒC. The study revealed that the TCF performance was influenced to an extent, by the top coat microstructure, but was primarily affected by the severity of thermally grown oxide (TGO) growth at the bond coat-top coat interface. Mixed failure modes comprising crack propagation through the bond coat-TGO interface, through TGO and within the top coat were identified. Based on the analysis of the experimental results and thorough discussion a novel design of microstructure for the high TCF performance columnar TBC is proposed.","Ganvir, Ashish;Vaidhyanathan, Venkateswaran;Markocsan, Nicolaie;Gupta, Mohit;Pala, Zdenek;Lukac, Frantisek",2018-02-15,Ceramics International,"Columnar Thermal Barrier Coatings,Axial Suspension Plasma spraying,Thermal Cyclic Fatigue, High Velocity Air Fuel Spraying",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.084,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.084
Oxidation and cracking/spallation resistance of ZrB2–SiC–TaSi2–Si coating on siliconized graphite at 1500 °C in air,"A ZrB2–SiC–TaSi2–Si coating on siliconized graphite substrate was prepared by a combination process of slurry brushing and vapor silicon infiltration. The high-temperature oxidation behavior and cracking/spallation resistance of the as-prepared coating were investigated in detail. It was revealed that the oxidation kinetics at 1500 °C in static air followed a parabolic law with a relatively low oxidation rate constant down to 0.27 mg/(cm2·h0.5). The crack area ratio of the as-prepared coating was determined as 3.8 × 10−3 after severe thermal cycling from 1500 °C to room temperature for 20 times. Apart from the formation of ZrO2 as skeleton phase with SiO2 as infilling species, the good oxidation and cracking/spallation resistance of the coating also could be attributed to its unique duplex-layered structure, i.e., a dense ZrB2–SiC–TaSi2 major layer filled with Si and an outermost Si cladding top layer. Meanwhile, the strong adhesion strength of the SiC transition layer with the graphite substrate and the outer ZrB2–SiC–TaSi2–Si layer was a vital factor as well.","Ren, Yan;Qian, Yuhai;Xu, Jingjun;Jiang, Yan;Zuo, Jun;Li, Meishuan",2020-04-01,Ceramics International,"Coating,Oxidation resistance,ZrB2–SiC–TaSi2,Vapor silicon infiltration",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.095,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.095
Microstructural characterisation of air plasma sprayed nanostructure ceramic coatings on Mg–1%Ca alloys (bonded by NiCoCrAlYTa alloy),"Nanostructured composite ceramic coatings consisting of Al2O3–13%TiO2 and Al2O3–13%TiO2/TiO2 on NiCoCrAlYTa-coated Mg alloys were sprayed using the atmospheric plasma spraying method. The composition and microstructure of the coated samples were investigated by XRD and FESEM equipped with EDS. Corrosion and wear behaviours of the coated samples were also evaluated. The results showed that Al2O3–13%TiO2/TiO2 coating is able to reduce the anodic dissolution of the Mg alloy in chloride solutions compared to other samples. The surface of the Al2O3–13%TiO2/TiO2 coating with the lowest wear rate exhibited a typical mild wear mode with narrow wear tracks along with very few small transferred particles. This observation was mainly related to the dense structure of the TiO2 coating, which could reduce severe spalling within the splats during the wear test.","Daroonparvar, Mohammadreza;Yajid, Muhamad Azizi Mat;Yusof, Noordin Mohd;Bakhsheshi-Rad, Hamid Reza;Hamzah, Esah",2016-01-31,Ceramics International,"Surfaces,Corrosion,TiO2,Substrates",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.08.118,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.08.118
One-step molten-salt-mediated preparation and luminescent properties of ultra-long SiC/SiO2 core–shell nanowires,"Ultra-long SiC/SiO2 core–shell nanowires were successfully prepared on a graphite felt with Ni(NO3)2 coating by a straightforward molten-salt-mediated carbothermal reduction route using silica fume and phenolic resin as starting materials at 1400°C. The as-synthesized nanowires, 150–500nm in diameter and up to several hundred microns in length, comprised a crystalline 3C–SiC core with a thin amorphous SiO2 shell (about 30nm). The growth mechanism of the as-synthesized nanowires was most likely controlled by the combination of vapor–liquid–solid and the vapor–solid mechanism. The photoluminescence spectrum of the ultra-long core–shell SiC/SiO2 nanowires exhibited a significant blue-shift, indicating a potential application in optoelectronic devices.","Zhang, Ju;Jia, Quanli;Zhang, Shiming;Huang, Juntong;Zhang, Shaowei",2016-02-01,Ceramics International,"SiC/SiO2 core–shell,Nanowires,Carbothermal reduction,Molten salt",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.10.015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.10.015
Thermal shock behavior of multilayer and functionally graded micro- and nano-structured topcoat APS TBCs,"Performance of air plasma sprayed (APS) thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) with multilayer and functionally graded topcoat were investigated in thermal shock conditions. Ceria-yttria stabilized zirconia (CSZ) and micro- and nano-structured yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ and YSZ-N) were used to produce coating samples. The samples were classified into four families, namely single-layer, double-layer, triple-layer and functionally graded (FG). To measure thermal shock resistance, the heating/water quenching cycles were repeated 70 times and 30% destruction of the coating was considered its functionality limit. Thus, cycles did not continue for those coatings that were destroyed more than 30%. At the end of each cycle, the surface and edge damage were determined from the photos of samples. Furthermore, scanning electron microscope (SEM) images and energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) analysis of samples’ cross-section were taken before and after the test. After collecting the experimental data, effects of various factors on outputs were investigated. The results showed that YSZ-N single-layer coating and triple-layer with CSZ as a top layer, has less thermally grown oxide (TGO) thickness and best performance in thermal shock conditions.","Ashofteh, A.;Mashhadi, M.

The kiln coating formation mechanism of MgO–FeAl2O4 brick,"MgO–FeAl2O4 brick used in the burning zone of a cement rotary kiln for 13 months was investigated. The bricks after usage consisted of three part, i.e. the original brick zone, the reaction part and the kiln coating zone. The phase and microstructure of the different part of the brick were analyzed using XRD and SEM with EDS. Based on this, the kiln coating mechanism of MgO–FeAl2O4 brick is proposed. The liquid phase of the cement clinker diffuses into the periclase crystal boundaries of MgO–FeAl2O4 brick, leading to the gradient of Fe and Al ions between the periclase boundary and crystal. Thus, calcium aluminate-ferrite phase (C4AF) is formed and further builds the network and “tree root” structure. This firmly combines C2S grains with the magnesia aggregates and thus the brick possesses good kiln coating formation performance.","Chen, Junhong;Yan, Mingwei;Su, Jindong;Li, Bin;Sun, Jialin",2016-01-31,Ceramics International,"MgO–FeAl2O4 brick,Cement clinker,Kiln coating formation,Morphology",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.08.148,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.08.148
Infrared radiative performance and anti-ablation behaviour of Sm2O3 modified ZrB2/SiC coatings,"To improve the emissivity of ZrB2/SiC coatings for serving in more serious environment, ZrB2/SiC coatings with varying contents of high emissivity Sm2O3 were fabricated using atmospheric plasma spraying. The microstructure, infrared radiative performance and anti-ablation behaviour of the modified coatings were investigated. The results showed that as the content of Sm2O3 increased, the density of the coatings increased because of the low melting point of Sm2O3. When the content of Sm2O3 was 10 vol%, the coating had the highest emissivity in the 2.5–5 μm band at 1000 °C, up to 0.85, because of the oxygen vacancies promoting additional electronic transitions. Due to the high emissivity, the surface temperature of the coating modified with 10 vol% Sm2O3 decreased by 300 °C, which led to little volatilisation of the sealing phase. Further, the mass ablation ratio of the above coating was 3.19 × 10−4 g/s, decreasing 31% compared to that of a ZrB2/SiC coating. The formed dense surface structure of the coatings showed considerable oxygen obstructive effects. These findings indicate that the modified coatings show considerable anti-ablation performance, which provides effective anti-ablation protection for the C/C composite substrate.","Xu, Junjie;Liu, Yanbo;Ma, Zhuang;Zhu, Shizhen;Wang, Yijin;Chen, Haikun;Ma, Kangzhi",2020-09-02,Ceramics International,"Anti-ablation,Emissivity,Plasma spray,Sm2O3",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.146,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.146
Attrition milling of silicon nitride powder under conditions for minimal impurity pickup,"Extremely fine-disperse silicon nitride powders were prepared by ball attrition milling. Surface areas greater than 50 m2/g were achieved without reaching a milling equilibrium and a corresponding upper surface limit. The diameter of the primary particles was decreased to such an extent that distinct changes could be observed in the X-ray diffractograms of Si3N4 powdders; until 20% of the amount of silicon nitride were transformed into the X-ray amorphous state. All parts of the attrition mill in contact with the charge were made of abrasion resistant materials, either of SSN ceramics (stirring arms and balls) or of polyamide plastics (jar and stirring shaft coating), in order to obtain the powders as pure as possible. In this way, additional metallic contaminations of the powder were completely avoided. In detail the composition changes of the Si3N4 powder as a function of the milling time were also analysed for the following constituents: aluminium, yttrium, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. Some consequences are pointed out for the subsequent handling and processing of the milled powders. Moreover, additional measures are offered in order to diminish the oxygen pickup caused by reactions of the powder with air and moisture during grinding.","Rabe, Torsten;Linke, Dietmar",1992-12-31,Ceramics International, ,10.1016/0272-8842(92)90090-Z,https://doi.org/10.1016/0272-8842(92)90090-Z
Mesoporous silica-coating of gold nanorods by a templated method,"Mesoporous silica with tunable morphology, pore architecture and crystallinity was successfully coated on gold nanorods by a template method based on the self-assembly of anionic surfactants with inorganic precursors. Varying the molar ratio of acid to surfactant or the volume ratio of ethanol to water resulted in products with different shapes, ranging from rods to spherical particles. A phase transformation of the mesoporous silica shell from 2D hexagonal to 3D cubic occurred due to an increased acid/surfactant ratio. Increasing the proportion of ethanol also gradually caused the disappear of 2D hexagonal symmetry of silica. The charge density matching relationship and solution polarity induced by varied reaction composition are believed to be the driving forces for the change of morphology and mesostructure.","Duan, Yangyang;Wang, Jing;Gao, Fan;Wang, Jing;Li, Yiye;Wang, Xin;Nie, Guangjun",2014-11-30,Ceramics International,"B.

Optimizing the structure and properties of Y2O3 stabilized zirconia: An atmospheric plasma spray (APS) and solution precursor plasma spray (SPPS) based comparative study,"The yttria stabilized zirconia (8%YSZ) is widely used to insulate the metallic components of the engine from high temperature and improve the operating temperature of gas turbine engines. With different processing parameters, 8YSZ coatings are prepared by atmospheric plasma spray (APS) and solution precursor plasma spray (SPPS) techniques and the microstructural features and thermodynamics properties are compared. The electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD) analysis indicate that the substitutional point defects (Zr0.86Y0.14O1.93) in the 8YSZ APS coatings are considerably higher than the corresponding SPPS coatings. The replacement of Zr4+ by Y3+ disturbs the charge neutrality of the system which might be compensated by the creation of oxygen vacancy. Both the substitutional point defects and the oxygen vacancies are the sources of phonon scattering, modifying the thermal conductivity of the coating. Pores and cracks are qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed in the microstructure of 8YSZ coatings. Strain tolerant and high thermal cycling life coatings are prepared by SPPS due to the existence of vertical cracks in the microstructure. Comparing the thermal insulation properties of the coatings, the APS coating provided lower thermal conductivities relative to the SPPS coatings which might be due to the high concentration of point defects and low concentration of the mixed oxide phase.","Khan, Matiullah;Zeng, Yi;Hu, Ningning;Lan, Zhenghua;Wang, Yongzhe",2018-10-15,Ceramics International,"APS,SPPS, 8YSZ, Microstructure,Thermal conductivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.021
Influence of post-annealing condition on the properties of ZnO films,"The study of the properties of zinc oxide (ZnO) films has gained popularity recently due to its potential in a wide range of applications, such as thin-film solar cells, transistors, sensors and other optoelectronic devices. In this work, low cost sol–gel spin coating technique was employed to fabricate the ZnO films. The influences of post-annealing condition on the properties of the ZnO films were investigated. The ZnO films were annealed under ambient, nitrogen and vacuum environments at 450°C and the environment effects on the ZnO films were compared. Furthermore, the effect of cooling period allowed for the ZnO films after the post-annealing process was examined. The ZnO films were characterized using surface profilometer, atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffractometer, and ultraviolet–visible transmission spectroscopy in order to study the thickness, surface morphology, crystallinity, and optical properties of the ZnO films. The optical band gap of the ZnO films was estimated based on the thickness and the optical transmittance data. These investigations serve to clarify the effects of different post-annealing conditions in order to optimize the properties of the ZnO films.","Ng, Zi-Neng;Chan, Kah-Yoong;Sin, Yew-Keong;Hoon, Jian-Wei;Ng, Sha-Shiong",2013-05-31,Ceramics International,"A.

It is revealed that, with the addition of an increased amount of Ag2O nanoparticles (NPs) in the MAO electrolyte, a less defective Ag-incorporated TiO2 coating with pores of decreased dimensions could be produced, which also exhibits a higher anatase-to-rutile ratio along with a lower Ag2O-to-Ag ratio. Further, both antibacterial capability and bone formability of Ag-incorporated TiO2 coatings were investigated.

Photocatalytic Nb2O5-doped TiO2 nanoparticles for glazed ceramic tiles,"TiO2 nanoparticles are currently used as coating for self-cleaning building products. In order to achieve high self-cleaning efficiency for outdoor applications, it is important that titania is present as anatase phase. Moreover, it is desirable that the particle sizes are in nano-range, so that a large enough surface area is available for enhanced catalytic performance. In this work, TiO2 nanoparticles doped with 0–5mol% Nb2O5 were synthesized by co-precipitation. Nb2O5 postponed the anatase to rutile transformation of TiO2 by about 200°C, such that after calcination at 700°C, no rutile was detected for 5mol% Nb2O5-doped TiO2, while undoped TiO2 presented 90wt% of the rutile phase. A systematic decreasing on crystallite size and increasing on specific surface area of TiO2 were observed with higher concentration of Nb2O5 dopant. Photocatalytic activity of anatase polymorph was measured by the decomposition rate of methylene blue under ultraviolet and daylight illumination and compared to commercial standard catalyst (P25). The results showed enhanced catalysis under UV and visible light for Nb2O5-doped TiO2 as compared to pure TiO2. In addition, 5mol% Nb2O5-doped TiO2 presented higher photocatalytic activity than P25 under visible light. The enhanced performance was attributed to surface chemistry change associated with a slight shift in the band gap.","da Silva, Andre L.;Muche, Dereck N.F.;Dey, Sanchita;Hotza, Dachamir;Castro, Ricardo H.R.",2016-03-31,Ceramics International,"Titanium dioxide,Rutile,Anatase,Photocatalysis,Ceramic tiles",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.12.029,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.12.029
Phase evolution and electrical properties of lead zirconate titanate thin films grown by using a triol sol–gel route,"Lead zirconate titanate (PZT) precursor sols were prepared using a triol based sol–gel route.

Improving optoelectrical properties of photoactive anatase TiO2 coating using rGO incorporation during plasma electrolytic oxidation,"In this study, photoactive anatase titanium dioxide (TiO2)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composite coatings were successfully developed on titanium substrate using plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) process to evaluate the effect of incorporated rGO on their photoactivity and optoelectrical properties. Structural and morphological examinations verified the incorporation of the rGO sheets in the anatase TiO2 coatings with pancake-like morphology. Optical spectroscopy revealed that a higher content of rGO enhanced the light absorption in UV and visible regions due to the high photo-trapping behavior of the composite samples. Photoluminescence declined by increasing rGO content, which suggested that the recombination of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs was suppressed. As a result, the photocurrent response of the TiO2/rGO coatings was enhanced significantly under UV radiation compared to the pure one, by which the photoactivity response revealed an over twenty-fold increase for a high concentration of rGO. Moreover, the electron transfer pathways created by the 2D structure of rGO sheets inside the anatase TiO2 network, promoted the photoresponsivity and photoswitching behavior more than 60%, interestingly.","Ebrahimi, Sema;Bordbar-Khiabani, Aidin;Yarmand, Benyamin;Asghari, M.

Effect of transition layer on the performance of hydroxyapatite/titanium nitride coating developed on Ti-6Al-4V alloy by magnetron sputtering,"A gradient transition multilayer hydroxyapatite/titanium nitride (HA/TiN) coating was prepared on the Ti-6Al-4V alloy by magnetron sputtering. The composition, surface topography, microstructure, adhesion strength and electrochemical properties of the as-deposited coatings were characterized by SEM/EDS, AFM, XRD, FT-IR and electrochemical workstation. The experimental results showed that the single TiN coating deposited at a partial pressure of nitrogen (N2) of 0.08 Pa had the best internal stress and tribological performance, and its volume loss was only 0.89% of that of Ti-6Al-4V alloy. The introduction of the TiN transition layer greatly improved the wear resistance of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy, and the adhesion strength of the HA layer to the substrate increased from 6.50 ± 0.5 N to 11.70 ± 1.2 N, an increase of 56%. The HA/TiN coating surface consisted of uniform hemispherical particles with dense structure and invisible defects (micro-cracks and pores). For the HA surface layer, the crystal structure and active hydroxyl (-OH) group was restored after heat treatment. Potentiodynamic polarization experiments indicated that the HA/TiN coating achieved the lowest corrosion current density and the most positive corrosion potential compared to the single TiN layer and Ti-6Al-4V alloy. In summary, it can be conclude that the gradient transition layer can well improve the mechanical properties and electrochemical behavior of the titanium alloy, and largely ensuring the stability of the surface bioactive coating.","Qi, Jianwei;Yang, Yiming;Zhou, Mingming;Chen, Zhangbo;Chen, Kai",2019-03-31,Ceramics International,"Hydroxyapatite,Titanium nitride,Ti-6Al-4V alloy,Magnetron sputtering,Gradient transition layer",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.183,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.183
Quality enhancement of copper oxide thin film synthesized under elevated gravity acceleration by two-axis spin coating,"Two-Axis spin coating as a new modified technique is employed to enhance the quality and surface leveling of thin films. The modified technology utilizes a synthetic centrifugal force perpendicular to the surface which generates an elevated gravity acceleration while spreading the coating on the entire wafer surface. In this paper, copper acetate sol-gel is coated by conventional and Two-Axis spin coating techniques. The coated layers are sintered in an air furnace at 275 °C. The fabricated layers are characterized by GIXRD, EDX, AFM and SEM devices. Wettability and Surface Free Energy (SFE) of sintered films using the contact angle technique are measured, and evaluated by the Owens-Wendt method. XRD and EDX spectra show a higher intensity of copper oxide phase using Two-Axis spin coating technology. AFM micrographs showed an improvement in the surface leveling within the Two-Axis spin coated layer. A comparison between the SFE of conventional and Two-Axis spin coated layers shows an increase in SFE of the layer synthesized under 200g artificial gravity acceleration.","Mahmoodi, Soroosh;Hassan, Dhia A.;Hojjati-Najafabadi, Akbar;Li, Wei;Liao, Liefa;Moshayedi, Ata Jahangir;Huang, Xueyu;Khajavi, Mehrdad Nouri",2020-04-15,Ceramics International,"Two-axis spin coating technology,Elevated gravity acceleration,Surface roughness,Surface free energy,Copper oxide thin film",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.238,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.238
Mechanical property evaluation of carbon nanotubes reinforced plasma sprayed YSZ-alumina composite coating,"Yttria (8%) stabilized zirconia (8YSZ)-alumina-carbon nanotube (CNT) composite coatings were deposited using air plasma spray (APS) technique. Three zirconia alumina (ZA) composite coatings, without CNT reinforcement, and with 1%CNT, 3%CNT reinforcement were deposited using identical process parameters (500A and 66V). Indentation method was used to characterize mechanical behavior of coatings. The CNT reinforced composite coating showed superior mechanical properties as compared to the conventional 8YSZ coating. The addition of alumina and 1%CNTs increased the Young's modulus by around 25% and 40%, respectively. However, the increase in CNT content decreased the Young's modulus as a result of CNT agglomeration. The hardness, fracture toughness increased with addition of alumina and CNT. The fracture toughness increased from 0.55 ± 0.26MPam1/2 for 8YSZ to 1.76 ± 0.65MPam1/2 for 17%alumina-3%CNT reinforcement due to various toughening mechanisms like crack deflection, bridging etc. The maximum displacement of indenter was found to decrease from ~ 176nm for conventional YSZ coating to ~ 120nm for 3% CNT reinforced coating. The surface roughness (Ra) was found to be decrease with alumina addition and CNT reinforced coating. The CNT reinforced coating showed surface roughness of around 6µm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was used to characterize the coating microstructure and elemental composition respectively.","Thakare, J.G.;Pandey, Chandan;Mulik, R.S.;Mahapatra, M.M.",2018-04-15,Ceramics International,"Carbon nanotubes,Alumina,Young's modulus,YSZ,Fracture toughness",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.131,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.131
Spinel LiMn2O4 cathode materials for lithium storage: The regulation of exposed facets and surface coating,"Minimal Mn dissolution was achieved with surface Mn4+-rich phase-modified truncated octahedral spinel LiMn2O4 with exposed {111} planes, which was synthesized via a simple hydrothermal reaction, followed by high temperature calcination in an oxygen atmosphere. The calcination atmosphere had a significant influence on the formation of the surface Mn4+-rich phase-modified layer; LiMn2O4 without a surface Mn4+-rich phase was obtained by calcination in an air atmosphere. Benefiting from the unique structure, the as-prepared LiMn2O4 exhibited an excellent rate capability and prolonged cycle stability, delivering a discharge capacity of 101 mAh g−1 and capacity retention rates of about 94% and 88% after 500 and 1000 cycles at 1C, respectively, compared to a discharge capacity of 86 mAh g−1 and a capacity retention rate of about 86% after 500 cycles at 1C for the LiMn2O4 prepared in an air atmosphere.

Facile synthesis of carbon-coated LiVO3 with enhanced electrochemical performances as cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries,"LiVO3 has been considered as a promising cathode material owing to the high specific capacity. But it suffers from the poor rate capability and cyclability. Carbon coating is an effective approach to improve the electrochemical performance, but the synthesis of carbon-coated LiVO3 has not been reported. Herein, we propose a novel method to synthesize carbon-coated LiVO3 (C@LVO) using a simple solution evaporation of LiNO3, VOC2O4 and resol precursors followed by a sync-carbonization strategy. In this approach, VOC2O4 is utilized as the precursor for the first time. Carbon layers and encapsulated LVO are simultaneously generated. An amorphous carbon layer with thickness around 10nm is observed on the surface of LVO particles using TEM. Compared to bare LVO, C@LVO shows a higher rate capability and more stable cyclability. C@LVO exhibits initial charge and discharge capacities of 281.3 and 339.5mAhg−1 and features long-term cyclability (125.2 and 125.4mAhg−1 at 200mAg−1 after 120 cycles). They possess lower charge-transfer resistance in comparison with bare LVO due to enhanced conductivity of the carbon layer. The higher specific capacity, improved cyclability and rate capability can be greatly attributed to the coated carbon layer, which resists the aggregation of LVO particles, and prevents the side reaction with electrolyte.","Zhao, Hu;Liu, Lei;Zhang, Xiuling;Gao, Rui;Hu, Zhongbo;Liu, Xiangfeng",2017-02-01,Ceramics International,"LiVO3,Carbon coating,Cathode,Sync-carbonization,Lithium-ion battery",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.209,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.209
In-situ study of mass and current density for electrophoretic deposition of zinc oxide nanoparticles,"In this study, zinc oxide nanoparticles were synthesized by the hydrothermal microwave-assisted method, followed by its deposition using electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method. An investigation of the characteristics of the synthesized nanoparticles was carried out using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The morphology and size distribution of the nanoparticles were examined by the images obtained from Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). The in-situ variations of mass and current density were investigated during the EPD. The effect of different parameters such as the solvent type at various voltages (20 and 40V) was investigated on EPD kinetics. By increasing the voltage from 20 to 40V in the methanol, the mass of the deposited film was increased up to about 38%. Similarly, in the ethanol, an increase equal to 39% was observed. The morphology and porosity of deposited nanoparticles were studied by analyzing the images of the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). It was observed that the porosity of the film in the ethanol was more than the methanol, at similar potentials. The increase in porosity at the voltage of 20 V was almost 3.1% and at 40V, it was approximately 4.4% with respect to methanol. Initial current densities in methanol at 20 and 40V were about 18 and 29% more than ethanol, respectively.","Hasanpoor, Meisam;Aliofkhazraei, Mahmood;Delavari H., Hamid",2016-05-01,Ceramics International,"Electrophoretic deposition,Microwave-assisted synthesis,Nanoparticles,Surface coating,Zinc oxide",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.01.076,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.01.076
Evolution mechanism of the microstructure and mechanical properties of plasma-sprayed yttria-stabilized hafnia thermal barrier coating at 1400 °C,"Yttria stabilized hafnia (Hf0.84Y0.16O1.92, YSH16) coatings were sprayed by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS). The effects of thermal aging at 1400 °C on the microstructures, mechanical properties and thermal conductivity of the coatings were studied. The results show that the as-sprayed coating was composed of the cubic phase, and the nano-sized monoclinic (M) phase was precipitated in the annealed coating. The presence of M phase effectively constrained the sintering of the coating due to its superior sintering-resistance. The Young's modulus kept at a nearly same level of ~78 GPa even after annealing, and the coating annealed for 6 h yielded a maximum value of hardness but revealed a declining tendency in the Vicker's hardness with prolonged sintering time. The thermal conductivity increased from 0.8-0.95 W m-1 K-1 at as-sprayed state to 1.6 W m-1 K-1 after annealing at 1400 °C for 96 h. The dual-phase coating is promising to serve at temperatures above 1400 °C due to its excellent thermal stability and mechanical properties.","Li, Chun;He, Jian;Ma, Yue;Guo, Hongbo",2020-10-15,Ceramics International,"Atmospheric plasma spray (APS),Yttria-stabilized hafnia (YSH),Thermal aging,Mechanical properties,Thermal conductivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.111,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.111
Synthesis and electrochemical properties of Na-doped LiTi2(PO4)3@carbon composite as anode for aqueous lithium ion batteries,"In this paper, Li1−xNaxTi2(PO4)3@carbon (x=0.01, 0.03, and 0.05) composites as anode for aqueous lithium ion batteries were synthesized by in situ coating approach. The doping of Na on Li sites did not break the lattice structure of LiTi2(PO4)3, while the lattice volume was increased by doping of Na. Among Na-doped LiTi2(PO4)3@carbon composites, Li0.97Na0.03Ti2(PO4)3@carbon (LC-Na-3) demonstrated the best electrochemical properties. Compared with the pristine LiTi2(PO4)3@carbon (LC) composite, LC-Na-3 composite exhibited better rate and cycling performance. LC-Na-3 composite delivered the discharge capacity of 98.5mAhg−1 at 0.2C and 45.0mAhg−1 at 15C, 10.9mAhg−1 and 32.1mAhg−1 larger than that of LC composite, respectively. Moreover, the discharge capacity retention for LC-Na-3 composite achieved 90.4%, 6.9% higher than that for LC composite at the rate of 2C after 300 cycles. The improved electrochemical properties of Na-doped LiTi2(PO4)3@carbon composite was ascribed to the decrease of charge transfer resistance and the acceleration of diffusion of lithium ions, resulting from the widening of diffusion channel for lithium ions, which was verified by XRD measurements.","Liu, Na;He, Zhangxing;Zhang, Xubo;Jiang, Yingqiao;Li, Yuehua;Zhu, Jing;Meng, Wei;Dai, Lei;Wang, Ling",2017-10-01,Ceramics International,"Aqueous lithium ion batteries,Anode,LiTi2(PO4)3,Composite,Na doping",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.322,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.322
Robust superhydrophobic 1D Ni3S2 nanorods coating for self-cleaning and anti-scaling,"Enormous attention has been attracted by Ni3S2 with various microstructures and excellent properties. In this work, a solvothermal reaction was adopted to fabricate 1D Ni3S2 nanorods coating. Then a superhydrophobic surface was achieved by the followed myristic acid modification. This superhydrophobic coating significantly hindered the infiltration of water. The attached contaminants could be easily carried away by water droplets owing to the low adhesion of the coating surface. In addition, the cooperation of low surface energy and 1D nanorods structure exhibited prominent anti-scaling property that effectively blocked the deposition of calcium carbonate. Moreover, it was confirmed that this superhydrophobic coating displayed outstanding thermostability, UV resistance and durability. In addition, water sand scouring and ultrasonic vibration tests were conducted to examine the mechanical stability, and the tested samples still maintained their superhydrophobicity and integrated nanorods structure. These excellent properties make the Ni3S2 superhydrophobic coating a promising barrier for anti-scaling.","Yin, Xiaoli;Yu, Sirong;Bi, Xiaojian;Liu, Enyang;Zhao, Yan",2019-12-15,Ceramics International,"Ni3S2 nanorods,Superhydrophobicity,Self-cleaning,Anti-scaling,Stability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.192,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.192
Synthesis of upconversion TiO2:Er3+-Yb3+ nanoparticles and deposition of thin films by spin coating technique,"In this work, a simple, low temperature (T < 300 °C) procedure suitable to increase the efficiency of solar cell and optoelectronic devices through reducing the mismatch with solar spectrum in the infrared range is proposed. TiO2 co-doped with rare earth ions is a promising candidate for its use in optical field due to the possibility to expand the spectral absorption range. Here, pure and Er3+-Yb3+co-doped anatase-TiO2 nano-spherical particles (diameter < 50 nm) with high surface area (125.7 m2/g and 140.6 m2/g for the pure and co-doped, respectively), good crystallinity are prepared by hydrothermal-assisted sol-gel method, followed by their dispersion and deposition as thin films. The nanoparticles are characterized by studying their structural, morphology, surface chemical compositions and photoluminescent properties. From the dispersion study, results showed that the optimal conditions were obtained for co-doped TiO2 at operational pH = 3 and with 20 min as a suitable duration of ultrasonication. The co-doped TiO2 nanoparticles showed excellent upconversion properties (green and red emissions) at room temperature under 980 nm excitation. To extend this result towards optoelectronic and photonic applications, the upconversion nanoparticles are deposited at the surface of n-type (100) Si wafer using a spin-coating process. From scanning electron microscopy, it is observed that the entire surface of substrate is covered with a uniform film composed of compact arrangement of small nanoparticles with a good adhesion on Si surface, also the resulting 750 nm thick TiO2:Er–Yb film maintained the upconversion luminescence phenomena.","Trabelsi, Fatma;Mercier, Frédéric;Blanquet, Elisabeth;Crisci, Alexandre;Salhi, Rached",2020-12-15,Ceramics International,"Sol-gel,Dispersion,Spin coating,Erbium,Ytterbium,Upconversion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.317,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.317
"Preparation, modification and characterization of plasma sprayed graphite/SiO2 powder and related coating","During the fabrication of functional high-endothermic-enthalpy graphite/SiO2 composite coating, the oxidation and vaporization of raw materials have become serious issues in hyperthermal preparation environment. In this study, these issues were addressed through densification and modification of the feedstock powder. Then, the corresponding coating was prepared by optimized plasma-spraying parameters. By investigating the modified feedstock powder and the resulting splats and coatings by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive spectroscopy, we realized an optimized composite feedstock powder preparation process and an ideal coating structure. The compactness of the powder reached its optimum after treating at 1400 °C for 2 h. After heat treatment densification and Ni shell covering processes, the modified powder exhibited good oxidation resistance, vaporization resistance, and spreading performance during plasma spraying. Thus, a pure and dense composite coating was prepared. Positive laser resistance performance was observed during the initial laser ablation test, which proved that this modified graphite/SiO2 coating has good application potential in the laser protection field. Moreover, this study provides an experimental basis and a feasible method for difficult-to-spray composite coatings’ preparation, such as graphite/SiO2 composite.","Li, Wenzhi;Gao, Lihong;Liu, Yanbo;Ma, Zhuang;Wang, Fuchi;Li, Hezhang",2019-02-01,Ceramics International,"Graphite/SiO2 composite coating,Plasma spraying,Densification treatment,Anti-laser property",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.138,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.138
Influence of microstructure on the wear and corrosion behavior of detonation sprayed Cr2O3-Al2O3 and plasma sprayed Cr2O3 coatings,"Cr2O3-20wt% Al2O3 cermet composite and Cr2O3 coatings were deposited by the detonation spray coating (DSC) and air plasma spray techniques on Ti-6Al-4V substrates. The microstructure and phase formation in the coatings were analysed. Micro hardness and fracture toughness of coatings were measured using Vickers diamond pyramid indenter. Owing to the well-defined layered structure with individually richer Cr2O3 and Al2O3 phases together with oxide-based solid solution at the splat boundaries, the DSC Cr2O3-Al2O3 composite coating exhibits dense microstructure and better indentation fracture toughness than the well established plasma sprayed Cr2O3 coating. Although the plasma sprayed Cr2O3 coating also exhibits layered structure; the relatively poor indentation fracture toughness is attributed to the significantly higher porosity and weaker inter-splat bonding. Towards understanding the relative tribological behavior, the sliding and three-body abrasive wear tests were conducted. The material removal mechanism and associated degradation behavior of detonation sprayed Cr2O3-Al2O3 coating has been correlated with coating microstructure comparatively against the plasma sprayed Cr2O3 coating. Electro-chemical corrosion tests of coatings in salt solution (artificial sea water) reveals an improved corrosion protection by Cr2O3-Al2O3 composite coating as compared to Cr2O3 coating. Enhanced tribological performance and corrosion resistance was attributed to the dense and crack free structure of Cr2O3-Al2O3 composite coating than its counterpart.","Babu, P.

Obvious corrosion reaction occurred between (Gd0.9Sc0.1)2Zr2O7 and V2O5 molten salt after 4h heat treatment, corrosion products being temperature dependent. At 700°C, large amount of Sc2O3 doped ZrV2O7 and GdVO4, together with a minor amount of Sc2O3-stabilized tetragonal ZrO2 (t-ZrO2), formed on the sample surfaces. With the increase of the test temperature, Sc2O3 doped ZrV2O7 turned to decompose, leading to the formation of more t-ZrO2. At 900°C and 1000°C, the corrosion products were composed of GdVO4 and t-ZrO2. The mechanism by which the corrosion reaction occurs is proposed based on phase diagrams and Lewis acid-base rule.","Zhang, Chenglong;Li, Mingzhu;Zhang, Yuchen;Guo, Lei;Dong, Junxiu;Ye, Fuxing;Li, Linwei;Ji, Vincent",2017-08-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,(Gd0.9Sc0.1)2Zr2O7,V2O5,Hot corrosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.048,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.048

The thermal cycling behavior of the three as-sprayed TBCs was investigated systematically at 1000℃ and 1200℃. The results reveal that the thermal cycling lifetime of the nanostructured DCL 8CSZ/8YSZ TBCs is the longest among them, which is largely due to the fact that the intermediate layer buffer effect of the DCL structure, more porosity and improvement of thermal expansion coefficient from doping CeO2 nanoparticles can relieve thermal stress to a great extent at elevated temperature. The failure mechanism of the nanostructured TBCs has been discussed in detail.","Zhou, Feifei;Wang, You;Cui, Zhongyuan;Wang, Liang;Gou, Junfeng;Zhang, Qiwen;Wang, Chaohui",2017-04-01,Ceramics International,"Nanostructured thermal barrier coatings,Atmospheric plasma spraying,Nanoscale CeO2 doping,Thermal cycling behavior",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.014
Microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of ultrasonic assisted laser clad yttria stabilized zirconia coating,"Yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) coatings were fabricated on a titanium alloy substrate by ultrasonic assisted laser cladding technique and the effect of ultrasonic vibration on the microstructure evolution and mechanical properties was investigated. Experimental results indicated that with the increase of ultrasonic output power, the clad depth increased, the wettability between coating and substrate was improved, the size of equiaxed grains in the cladding zone decreased, and the band structures were broken up gradually. Simultaneously, the element content distribution along the thickness of coating in the transition region changed from exponential to linear distribution gradually, together with the increase of dilution rate. With the increase of ultrasonic output power, the microhardness distribution of fusion zone also converted from an exponential to a linear distribution. Additionally, the friction and wear tests showed that the wear mechanism of coatings both with and without ultrasonic vibration was abrasive wear while the friction coefficients of coating with ultrasonic vibration were lower than that without ultrasonic vibration, which was related to the refined microstructures within the YSZ coatings.","Ma, Guangyi;Yan, Shuai;Wu, Dongjiang;Miao, Qiuyu;Liu, Miaoran;Niu, Fangyong",2017-09-30,Ceramics International,"Laser cladding,Ultrasonic vibration,ZrO2 coating,Microstructures,Mechanical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.103,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.103
Influence of stearic acid on suspension structure and green microstructure of injection-molded zirconia ceramics,"The effect of stearic acid (added as a surfactant and/or a lubricant) on powder dispersion and particle packing of a zirconia ceramic/binder system has been investigated. Microstructural examination revealed that the addition of stearic acid prevented the particles from making a direct surface-to-surface contact. Contrarily, an insufficient coverage of the acid onto the powder surface resulted in a formation of particulate networks and led to an increase in suspension viscosity. A significant reduction in the most frequent pore size of the thermally debound samples was found as the fraction of stearic acid exceeded 3wt% on the basis of powder loading. This corresponds to a nominal >90% of surface coating by the adsorbed acid before being blended with the wax/polymer as a binder. The acid adsorption gradually reached a plateau as the acid increases above 3wt%. High acid quantities (>5wt%) are detrimental to the molding integrity as cracks were observed during thermal removal of the binder. ©","Tseng, Wenjea J.;Liu, Dean-Mo;Hsu, Chung-King",1999-03-31,Ceramics International,"Ceramic injection molding,Zirconia,Stearic acid,Particle packing,Rheology,Agglomeration",10.1016/S0272-8842(98)00024-8,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0272-8842(98)00024-8
Ablation of vacuum plasma sprayed TaC-based composite coatings,"TaC-25vol%MoSi2 and TaC-25vol%SiC composite coatings were prepared by vacuum plasma spray on SiC coated C/C composites, aiming to improve their ablation resistance. The phase composition and microstructure of the coatings were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometry and X-ray diffraction, respectively. The ablation behavior of the coatings was evaluated by a plasma flame over 2000°C for 60s. TaC coating was also fabricated for comparison. The results showed that MoSi2 and SiC uniformly distributed in the composite coatings. The ablation tests demonstrated that the TaC coating was totally oxidized during the ablation process with significant volume expansion. The formed Ta2O5 was porous and blown away by the gas flow. The surface layer of the TaC–MoSi2 coating was oxidized during ablation and the oxide layer was partially detached from the underneath layer due to the evaporation of MoO3. The TaC–SiC coating exhibited a low mass loss of 0.32%, 68% lower compared to the TaC coating, and exhibited excellent ablation resistance. It was thought that the comparatively dense Ta2O5–SiO2 layer formed on the coating surface was beneficial for both the oxidation–corrosion and mechanical-erosion resistance.","Pu, Hui;Niu, Yaran;Hu, Cui;Wang, Guocheng;Li, Hong;Zeng, Yi;Zheng, Xuebin",2015-11-30,Ceramics International,"TaC,Composite coatings,Vacuum plasma spray,Ablation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.05.100,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.05.100
Thermal shock resistance and mechanical properties of La2Ce2O7 thermal barrier coatings with segmented structure,"La2Ce2O7 (LCO) is a promising candidate material for thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) application because of its higher temperature capability and better thermal insulation property relative to yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ). In this work, La2Ce2O7 TBC with segmentation crack structure was produced by atmospheric plasma spray (APS). The mechanical properties of the sprayed coatings at room temperature including microhardness, Young's modulus, fracture toughness and tensile strength were evaluated. The Young's modulus and microhardness of the segmented coating were measured to be about 25 and 5GPa, relatively higher than those of the non-segmented coating, respectively. The fracture toughness of the LCO coating is in a range of 1.3–1.5MPam1/2, about 40% lower than that of the YSZ coating. The segmented TBC had a lifetime of more than 700 cycles, improving the lifetime by nearly two times as compared to the non-segmented TBC. The failure of the segmented coating occurred by chipping spallation and delamination cracking within the coating.","Wang, Yi;Guo, Hongbo;Gong, Shengkai",2009-09-30,Ceramics International,"La2Ce2O7 (LCO),Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs),Segmentation cracks,Thermal shock",10.1016/j.ceramint.2009.02.025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2009.02.025
"Synthesis and characterization of PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2−x Ni x O5+δ (x=0.1, 0.2 and 0.3) cathodes for intermediate temperature SOFCs","Strontium and nickel co-doped layerd-perovskite PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2−x Ni x O5+δ (PBSCN) with various proportions of nickel (x=0.1, 0.2 and 0.3, abbreviated as PBSCN-1, PBSCN-2 and PBSCN-3, respectively) are investigated as cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs). The PBSCN powders are synthesized by a combined EDTA–citrate complexing sol–gel method. Then PBSCN pellets are sintered at 1100°C for 10h in air. The materials exhibit an orthorhombic structure with the space group of Pmmm. The electrical conductivity is determined by the van der Pauw method at the temperature range of 400–800°C. It is shown that the electrical conductivity declines with increasing temperature for all the samples. The highest conductivity of 1590Scm−1 for PBSCN-3 is obtained at 400°C. The thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) decreases with the increase of Ni content. The average TEC at the temperature range of 30–900°C decreases from 21.9×10−6 K−1 for PBSCN-1 to 19.7×10−6 K−1 for PBSCN-3. Yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) with thickness in 0.3mm is used as the electrolyte in this study. Electrolyte supported fuel cells prepared by coating method are employed to study the electrochemical properties from 600 to 800°C. The polarization resistances of PBSCN samples on YSZ electrolyte at 800°C are 0.297, 0.314 and 0.321Ωcm2 for PBSCN-1, PBSCN-2 and PBSCN-3, respectively. The single fuel cell with the configuration of PBSCN-1/YSZ/Pt delivers the highest power density of 120mWcm−2 at 800°C.","Liu, Lan;Guo, Ruisong;Wang, Shanshan;Yang, Yuexia;Yin, Dongsheng",2014-12-31,Ceramics International,"Solid oxide fuel cell,Layered-pervoskite PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2−x Ni x O5+δ cathode,Electrochemical performance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.07.144,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.07.144
Online monitoring of laser remelting of plasma sprayed coatings to study the effect of cooling rate on residual stress and mechanical properties,"This investigation deals with laser remelting of plasma sprayed alumina and chromia coatings. The time-temperature history of the laser remelted zone was recorded using an infrared pyrometer during the remelting operation. Cooling rates, under varying scanning speed, were determined from the time temperature curve. Surface morphology, microstructure, and phases of the laser treated and as-sprayed coatings were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, respectively. X-ray diffraction was also employed to measure the surface residual stress of the coatings. Inherent features of plasma sprayed coatings like porosity and inter-lamellar boundary were obliterated upon laser remelting. A columnar grain growth perpendicular to the laser scanning direction was observed. The range of roughness of the as-sprayed coatings reduced from 6 to 8 µm to 1–2 µm in the remelted layers. For both coatings, more than 90% reduction in porosity was found upon laser remelting. Surface residual stress of the as-sprayed alumina and chromia coatings was found to be tensile and compressive, respectively. Within the limits of the testing condition the tensile residual stress of the remelted layers increased by up to around 500% in the alumina coatings. In the chromia coating a decrease of compressive stress by up to around 80% was recorded. In the remelted layer the tensile nature of the stress showed a tendency to increase with an increase in the cooling rate. However, the state of stress of the as-sprayed layer, i.e., tensile or compressive, was retained in the remelted layer. The residual stress was found to decrease in the remelted layer with an increase in the degree of overlap of the remelted tracks.","Das, Biswajit;Nath, Ashish Kumar;Bandyopadhyay, P.P.",2018-05-31,Ceramics International,"Porosity,X-ray methods,Mechanical properties,Al2O3",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.152,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.152
Binder-free multilayered SnO2/graphene on Ni foam as a high-performance lithium ion batteries anode,"The reasonable structure construction of electrode materials with superior performance is desired for the new generation lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Herein, binder-free multilayered SnO2/graphene (GN) on Ni foam was fabricated via a dip coating method. SnO2 nanoparticles and GN were alternatively coated on Ni foam to form a sandwich-like structure. The wrapping of GN can raise the conductivity and keep the structural integrality of the binder-free material, preventing structure collapse arised from the volume expansion of SnO2. Benefiting from the porous Ni foam framework and sandwich-like structure, the SnO2/GN composite exhibited good rate performance and excellent cycle stability. High capacities of 708 and 609 mAh g−1 were achieved at rates of 1 and 2 A g−1. Besides, the SnO2/GN electrode delivered a high capacity of 757 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at 1 A g−1.","Zhan, Liang;Zhou, Xiaosong;Luo, Jin;Ning, Xiaomei",2019-04-15,Ceramics International,"SnO2,Graphene,Binder-free,Ni foam,Lithium ion batteries",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.190,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.190
Impact of spinel forming systems (Fe-/Mg-/Mn-Al-O) as functional coating materials for carbon-bonded alumina filters on steel melt filtration,"Since solid, non-metallic inclusions influence considerably the quality of casted steel products, carbon-bonded alumina foam filters are used in secondary metallurgical treatments to remove these particles from steel melts. In order to attain a significant improvement of the filtration process, five different carbonaceous spinel compounds from the Fe-/Mg-/Mn-Al-O systems are applied on carbon-bonded alumina filters in this study and investigated with regard of their filtration efficiency. However, these spinel compounds decompose partially during sintering at 1400 °C under reducing atmosphere, wherefore the resulting coatings contain not only spinel compounds, but also oxidic and metallic components. The subsequent interaction with molten steel leads to the development of multicrystal structures on the filter surface, which stem from interfacial reactions between coating materials, molten steel, and inclusions. As a result of this procedure, a reduction of almost 60% alumina inclusions is measured with the aid of an automatic SEM, whereby spinel compounds from the Fe-Mn-Al-O system achieve highest filtration efficiencies.","Bock, Benjamin;Schmidt, Anne;Sniezek, Edyta;Dudczig, Steffen;Schmidt, Gert;Szczerba, Jacek;Aneziris, Christos G.",2019-03-31,Ceramics International,"B Interfaces,B Inclusions,E Refractories,Steel melt filtration",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.131,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.131
Dynamic oxidation resistance and residual mechanical strength of ZrB2-CrSi2-SiC-Si/SiC coated C/C composites,"To improve oxidation resistance of carbon/carbon (C/C) composites, a multiphase double-layer ZrB2-CrSi2-SiC-Si/SiC coating was prepared on the surface of C/C composites by pack cementation. Thermogravimetry analysis showed that the as-prepared coating could provide effective oxidative protection for C/C composites from room temperature to 1490°C. After thermal cycling between 1500°C and room temperature, the fracture behaviors of the as-prepared specimens changed and their residual flexural strengths decreased as thermal cycles increased. The specimen after 20 thermal cycles presented pseudo-plastic fracture characteristics and relatively high residual flexural strength (83.1%), while the specimen after 30 thermal cycles failed catastrophically without fiber pullout due to the severe oxidation damage of C/C substrate especially the brittleness of the reinforcement fibers.","Li, Kezhi;Hu, Manhong",2017-04-15,Ceramics International,"Carbon/carbon composites,Oxidation,Coating,Thermal cycling,Fracture mode",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.135,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.135
The fracture toughness of alumina coatings plasma-sprayed at different in situ temperatures,"Alumina coatings were prepared by atmospheric plasma spraying through controlling the surface temperature of the coatings during spraying. Both the polished and fractured cross-section microstructures of the coatings were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The phase structures of the coatings and the feedstock were analyzed by X-ray diffraction technique (XRD). The microstructure and phase structure of the coatings prepared at different substrate temperatures were examined. SEM observations show that the intersplat bonding within the coatings was significantly improved by increasing the substrate temperature. The fracture toughness of the deposits was measured by indentation methods. For the coatings prepared at low substrate temperatures, the fracture toughness increased with the substrate temperature due to the improvement in the intersplat bonding. However, a significant decrease in the fracture toughness was found for the coatings prepared at high substrate temperatures. The change in phase structure of the coatings suggested that the residual tensile stress mainly resulted from phase transformation from γ-alumina to α-alumina at high substrate temperature should answer for the decline in the fracture toughness.","Xing, Ya-Zhe;Wei, Qiu-Lan;Hao, Jian-Min",2012-08-31,Ceramics International,"Plasma spraying,Alumina,Phase transformation,Fracture toughness",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.02.048,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.02.048
Enhancement of tribological properties of DLC by incorporation of amorphous titanium using magnetron sputtering process,"Titanium-diamond-like carbon (Ti-DLC) composite coatings were deposited on 304 SUS substrates by periodic sputtering of Ti in between DLC deposition with different Ti target powers using a magnetron sputtering system. Microstructure as well as the mechanical and tribological properties of the Ti-DLC composite coatings were highly dependent on the Ti target power which was varied from 75 to 150 W. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed that the Ti atoms in DLC coatings were in an amorphous state which was beneficial for deterring crack nucleation within the coating. Furthermore, premature delamination of a pure DLC coating with a thickness of ∼330 nm could be prevented by inclusion of Ti in DLC. All the Ti-DLC composite coatings were capable of drastically enhancing the friction and wear properties of bare 304 SUS. The coating deposited with a target power of 85 W showed the highest wear resistance with a wear rate of ∼3.13 × 10−11 mm3/N mm, which was extremely low for a dry sliding condition. This outcome was attributed to ultra-fine distribution of amorphous Ti in DLC which led to low internal stress and high ID/IG ratio of the coating.","Dhandapani, Vishnu Shankar;Kang, Kyoung-Mo;Seo, Kuk-Jin;Kim, Chang-Lae;Kim, Dae-Eun",2019-06-15,Ceramics International,"Metal-matrix composites,Adhesion,Wear,Mechanical properties,Durable coatings",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.090,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.090
"Fabrication, microstructural characterization and mechanical properties evaluation of Ti/TiB/TiB2 composite coatings deposited on Ti6Al4V alloy by electro-spark deposition method","In this study, briquettes of Ti–TiB–TiB2 composite were produced by mixing Ti and B powders, performing self-propagating high-temperature synthesis process and by applying hydrostatic pressure on the reaction products with a high-capacity press. Ti–TiB–TiB2 was then coated to Ti6Al4V substrate by Electro-Spark Deposition (ESD) technique under two atmospheres of air and argon, single and double-layer coatings and in two energy levels of 40 W and 110 W as input powers. Coatings microstructure were examined by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) equipped with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) analyzer. Comparison of the coatings microstructure with the electrode microstructure shows that the coatings have a much finer microstructure than that of the electrode due mainly to the high solidification rate in the ESD process. Microstructural observations also revealed that the main phases in the coatings are needle-shaped TiB and particle-shaped TiB2 in the Ti matrix. The coating microstructure was much finer due to an increase in solidification rate by reducing the input power from 110 to 40 W. In such a situation, two phases of TiB2 and TiB with nanometer sizes were scattered in the Ti matrix. Also, due to the trapping of the gases in low input power of 40 W, a limited number of very small gas pores was created in the microstructure. Interface examination of the coating and the substrate by the Line Scan and X-ray Image show a good coherence of the coating with the substrate. Adhesion results showed that the bond strength between the coating and the substrate was higher than 50 MPa in all coatings. No crack was observed in the coatings after bending tests which were performed, in accordance with the intended standard, on the samples around a mandrel. The hardness of all coatings was increased with decreasing the input energy from 110 to 40 W.","Shafyei, Hassan;Salehi, Mehdi;Bahrami, Abbas",2020-07-31,Ceramics International,"Ti/TiB/TiB2 MMC coating,Microstructural,Mechanical properties,Electro-spark deposition,SHS process,Ti6Al4V",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.068,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.068
Jet pulse electrodeposition and characterization of Ni–AlN nanocoatings in presence of ultrasound,"In current study, Ni–AlN nanocoatings were successfully prepared by adopting the jet pulse electrodeposition (JPE) technique with ultrasound. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Vickers microhardness test, electrochemical workstation and friction wear tests were utilized to investigate the microstructure, mechanical properties, corrosion degree and wear resistance of the coatings. The results indicated that the Ni–AlN nanocoatings deposited by using ultrasound demonstrated the minimum and most compact surface structure compared to the other coatings. The thicknesses of Ni coating and Ni–AlN nanocoatings were approximately 56µm. The average atomic percent of Al and Ni elements in the Ni–AlN nano-coating prepared by using ultrasound, were approximately 21.4at% and 47.5at%, respectively. The maximum kinetic energy of the jet plating solution was 916m2/s2 during JPE-deposited Ni-AlN nanocoatings including ultrasound. The average micro-hardness value of the nano-coating prepared by using ultrasound equaled 767.9 HV. The Ni–AlN nanocoatings prepared using ultrasound had the minimum E corr and I corr values of − 0.167V and 6.363 × 10−6 mA/cm2, respectively. In this case, the demonstrated corrosion resistance was the most efficient. The Ni–AlN nanocoatings prepared using ultrasound sustained the minimum friction coefficients and the average friction coefficient was approximately 0.52. In contrast, the JPE-deposited Ni coating presented the maximum friction coefficient, while the average friction coefficient was approximately 1.43.","Ma, Chunyang;Yu, Wanying;Jiang, Minzheng;Cui, Wei;Xia, Fafeng",2018-04-01,Ceramics International,"Ni–AlN nanocoating,Jet pulse electrodeposition,Microstructure,Property,Ultrasound",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.121,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.121
Inhibiting tribocorrosion damage of Cr/CrxN coatings by multi-layer design,"The two-layer and multi-layer Cr/CrxN coatings were fabricated on 316 L stainless steel (316 L SS) substrates by the arc ion plating technique. The two-layer Cr/CrxN coating was a typical CrN coating with an adhesive Cr layer. And the multi-layer Cr/CrxN coating design was in two dimensions. In the first dimension, the multi-layer Cr/CrxN coating consisted of alternative Cr/CrN layers with the thickness ratio of 1:5; in the second dimension, the alternative Cr2N layers with the thickness of 10 nm were inserted in CrN layers. This design was expected to increase transverse interfaces in a smaller scale. The microstructures, mechanical, corrosion and tribocorrosion performances of both Cr/CrxN coatings were systematically investigated. The results showed that the special multi-layer design of Cr/CrxN coatings improved mechanical, anti-corrosion and anti-tribocorrosion performances. Compared with the two-layer Cr/CrxN coating, the reduced tribocorrosion damage of the muti-layer Cr/CrxN coating was closely related to the inhibited synergistic effect between electrochemical corrosion and mechanical wear. In conclusion, the multi-layer Cr/CrxN coating was more suitable to work as the surface protective coating than the two-layer Cr/CrxN coating in seawater.","Wang, Yixuan;Zhang, Jingwen;Wang, Yongxin;Wang, Chunting;Guo, Wuming;Lu, Xiaojiang;Sui, Yongfeng;Lan, Jibing",2020-08-25,Ceramics International,"Multi-layer,Microstructure,Tribocorrosion performance,Seawater",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.196,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.196

With this method, Al2O3 was well coated on the surface of Ba0.95Ca0.05Ti0.85Zr0.15O3 powders, resulting in homogenous microstructure, excellent dielectric and electrical properties. The specimen with an appropriate coating amount of 0.4wt% Al2O3 exhibited the most outstanding properties. The dielectric constant at room temperature could reach ~13,600, with low dielectric loss (~0.5%) and high insulation resistivity (~6.2×1011 Ω·cm).

Hot corrosion behavior of BaLa2Ti3O10 exposed to calcium-magnesium-alumina-silicate at elevated temperatures,"Calcium-magnesium-alumina-silicate (CMAS) attack has been regarded as one of the significant failure mechanisms for thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). In this study, CMAS corrosion behavior of BaLa2Ti3O10, a novel TBC material, is investigated at 1300 °C and 1350 °C for 0.5 h, 4 h, 12 h and 24 h. Results reveal that BaLa2Ti3O10 has high resistance to molten CMAS infiltration, attributable to the formation of a dense reaction layer. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive spectroscope, transmission electron microscope confirm that the layer consists of apatite, celsian and perovskite phases. With increased corrosion duration, the layer retains good phase stability and the thickness increases. The formation of corrosion products and the reaction layer are discussed according to a dissolution-reprecipitation mechanism and the optical basicity theory.","Yu, Jianxing;Wang, Caimei;Guo, Lei;Yu, Yang;Ye, Fuxing;Li, Muyu;Wang, Huakun;Yang, Zhenglong",2018-06-15,Ceramics International,"BaLa2Ti3O10,Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs),Calcium-magnesium-alumina-silicate (CMAS),Corrosion mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.021
Aluminum borophosphate glaze-coated aluminum alloy substrate: Coating properties and coating/substrate coupling,"Thermal fatigue can cause irreversible damage in aluminum alloys restricting their use in the automotive industry, despite their excellent mechanical and technological properties. The application of ceramic coating is an alternative to obtain a protective barrier to improve the wear resistance at high temperatures. However, the low melting point and high coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of aluminum alloys limit the coating options. Thus, a suitable coupling feature can be obtained between aluminum alloys and a glazed coating. A glazed coating based on the aluminum borophosphate system was developed and applied onto an aluminum-silicon-copper commercial alloy. The coating was characterized by X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy, hardness tests, and thermal analysis. The coupling between the glazed coating and the aluminum alloy surface was studied employing optical dilatometry and optical fleximetry. A dense, good adhesion coating and presenting adequate dilatometric coupling (effective coupling temperature of 345 °C) related to the investigated aluminum alloy was obtained at 500 °C. The good compatibility of CTE between the layers (24.54 × 10−6 °C-1 for the substrate and 14.56 × 10−6 °C-1 for the coating) led to a crack-free material. For this reason, microhardness increased from 136 (aluminum alloy) to 325 HV (glazed aluminum alloy). The glazed coating can expand the use of this alloy, improving its performance and thermal efficiency. This result suggests an enormous potential of applications in the automotive industry, for instance.","Franceschini, Francieli Gonçalves;Klegues Montedo, Oscar Rubem;Arcaro, Sabrina;Bergmann, Carlos Pérez",2020-09-06,Ceramics International,"Aluminum alloy,Glazed coating,Coefficient of thermal expansion,Thermal coupling",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.037,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.037
Oxidation protection of aluminum metaphosphate coating prepared by cathodic electrochemical treatment for graphite,"In order to provide a short-term oxidation protection system for graphite at high temperature, an aluminum metaphosphate coating was prepared on the surface of graphite by cathodic electrochemical treatment, and its oxidation protective ability was investigated using an isothermal oxidation test. The microstructure, chemical composition, and phase components of the aluminum metaphosphate coating were respectively analyzed through scanning electron microscope, dispersive X-ray analysis, and X-ray diffraction. The results showed that aluminum metaphosphate coating with a thickness of about 24 μm provides good oxidation resistance for graphite at 1250 °C, and it reduces the oxidation rate of graphite in a 5-h period by a factor of two. The good oxidation protective ability of the as-prepared coating at 1250 °C is related to the formation of a layer consisting of aluminum metaphosphate and aluminum orthophosphate phases.","Shooshtari Gugtapeh, H.;Jafarzadeh, K.;Valefi, Z.",2019-09-30,Ceramics International,"Graphite,Aluminum metaphosphate coating,Isothermal oxidation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.084,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.084
Cyclic oxidation of Ti3Al-based materials,"The microstructure variation and oxidation behavior of a hot-rolled and quenched Ti-24Al-11Nb (at%) intermetallic alloy with and without protective Ni-20Cr (at%) coating were studied in the air at a cyclic annealing temperature of 600 °C and 900 °C. The phase transformations monitored up to 120 h of alloy oxidation and oxidation products were examined using different experimental techniques. The oxidation kinetics was determined by recording the mass gain vs. time data and oxidation activation energy was evaluated. It was found that the annealing temperature and deposited coating significantly affect the scale formation and growth. The alloy showed better oxidation resistance at 600 °C, irrespective of the protective coating application. The higher temperature promoted the formation of thicker and multi-layered scale predominantly composed of Nb-doped TiO2 and Al2O3 oxides, which cracked and spalled causing oxidation rate for an order of magnitude higher than that at 600 °C. The presence of AlN decelerated the oxide scale growth, which obeyed a parabolic rate law. It was also noted that a two-phase α 2 +β microstructure changed to a greater extent. With increasing temperature, the α 2 →β phase transformation occurred more intensive and new α 2 ′′ and O-Ti2AlNb phase appeared. The Ni-20Cr coating reduced the oxidation rate at both temperatures and improved the scale-spallation resistance. The compact Cr2O3 layer formed on the coated alloy led to the preferential Al2O3 formation, increasing its amount in mixture with Nb-enriched TiO2 oxide. Thin TiN layer detected beneath the oxide scale also supported the formation of slow-growing Al2O3, leading to a decrease in the oxidation rate. The external scale suppression contributed to the greater diffusion zone enrichment, resulting in the faster O-Ti2AlNb formation. The experimentally observed O-Ti2AlNb formation was confirmed by ab initio modeling. Furthermore, additional structures were predicted and studied using first-principles calculations in the O-Ti2AlNb compound.","Cvijović-Alagić, I.;Cvijović, Z.;Zagorac, D.;Jovanović, M.T.",2019-05-31,Ceramics International,"Ti3Al-based alloy,Cyclic oxidation,Ni-Cr coating,Phase transformation,Structure prediction",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.287,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.287
Effect of mullite on the microstructure and oxidation behavior of thermal-sprayed MoSi2 coating at 1500 °C,"MoSi2 coatings with different mullite additions (0, 10 wt%, and 30 wt%) were prepared on siliconized Nb alloys and oxidation behaviors of the modified coatings were comparatively investigated at 1500 °C in static air. After oxidation for 140 h, the 10 wt% mullite modified coating presented an outstanding oxidation resistance with a mass loss of 4.06 mg/cm2 in comparison to the unmodified coating and the 30 wt% modified case. A proper amount of mullite addition in MoSi2 coating can restrain the crystallization of SiO2 during the oxidation process, thus a crack-free oxide scale was obtained so as to prevent the inward diffusion of oxygen. However, excessive addition of mullite (30 wt%) in MoSi2 coating can severely hinder the formation of the crack-free oxide scale due to the volume shrinkage of the amorphous mullite, which accelerated the failure of the protective coatings.","Zhang, Guangpeng;Sun, Jia;Fu, Qiangang",2020-06-01,Ceramics International,"MoSi2,Mullite,Coating,Plasma spray,Oxidation,Nb alloy",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.273,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.273
Development of hydroxyapatite coatings on laser textured 316 LSS and Ti-6Al-4V and its electrochemical behavior in SBF solution for orthopedic applications,"The current work focused on the development of hydroxyapatite (HAP) coating on laser textured metallic implants using electrophoretic deposition. HAP was synthesized by sol-gel technique and its phase purity and surface morphology were confirmed by FT-IR, XRD and SEM analysis. 316L SS and Ti-6Al-4V metal implants were polished and the surface was modified using Nd-YAG laser operating at a pulse interval of 10ns at various overlapping rate of 0%, 25% and 50%. The laser treated surface was characterized for its surface roughness using surface profilometry and surface morphology. The surface roughness of the metallic implants was increased by increase in the overlapping rate. The prepared HAP powder was electrophoretically deposited on bare and laser textured Ti-6Al-4V and 316L stainless steel followed by vacuum sintering at 300°C for 2h. Scratch analysis results showed an improvement in adhesion strength for the HAP coatings on laser treated specimens than untreated metal. Corrosion efficiency of the coated samples was studied in SBF solution using EIS and potentiodynamic polarization studies. The result from the corrosion experiments proved increased corrosion resistance property of laser textured coated samples when compared to bare alloy due to higher adhesion of HAP coating on the metal surface.","Stango, S.

Field emission scanning electron microscope integrated with focused ion beam milling and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was employed for microstructural and chemical characterizations. The tribo-mechanical test results revealed that Cr/CrN promoted up to 5 times greater hardness, Ti/TiN showed the highest scratch resistance and up to 8 times reduced wear, while TiCr/TiCrN favored the least friction and surface roughness. Furthermore, the excellent tribological properties of coatings correlated with their superior adhesion to AL7075-T6.","Ezazi, M.A.;Quazi, M.M.;Zalnezhad, E.;Sarhan, Ahmed A.D.",2014-12-31,Ceramics International,"Ceramic coatings,Magnetron sputtering,AL 7075-T6 alloy,Tribo-mechanical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.07.067,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.07.067
Mechanical and tribological properties of silicon carbide coating on Inconel alloy from liquid pre-ceramic precursor,Liquid polycarbosilane (LPCS) derived hard coatings of silicon carbide (SiC) were deposited on Inconel alloy at three different moderately high temperatures by chemical vapour deposition. The deposited films were characterized by X-ray diffractometry and Field emission scanning electron microscopy. Liquid PCS yielded a mixture of α-SiC and β-SiC during decomposition having uniform round-shaped particles of dimension around 200–300nm without extensive cracking and few discrete shaped particles were also found to form at higher temperature (i.e. 1100°C and 1200°C) deposited films. The coated samples showed substantial increment in hardness and fracture toughness as compared to the uncoated sample. The fracture toughness (KIC) values of the deposited films were in the range of 6.7–10.7MPa(m)1/2. The tribological properties and hardness of the films were also found to vary with deposition temperature. The scratch tracks of the films revealed that brittle failures occurred in all SiC coated substrates.,"Mukherjee, J.;Chakraborty, S.;Chakravarty, S.;Ranjan, A.;Das, P.K.",2014-06-30,Ceramics International,"D.

Enhanced write-once optical storage capacity of Cu3N film by coupling with an Al2O3 protective layer,"A novel write-once optical storage device with large-capacity storage was designed and constructed based on Cu3N film. In this work, Cu3N films were deposited on the glass substrates by DC magnetron sputtering at room temperature. After coating with the absorbed and protective layers, the sandwich-like devices were irradiated by the pulsed laser through the different mask templates to record the informations (letters matrix “IAM”). The results demonstrate that the informations were stored accurately and efficiently through the observation of confocal microscope. After coating with the protective layer (Al2O3), the storage capacity was found to be improved dramatically. According to the unique advantages of the device, such as the intrinsic low decomposition temperature of Cu3N and the protection of stable Al2O3 layer, we have successfully assembled a novel write-once optical storage device with noteworthy storage capacity.","Zhao, Yanghua;Zhao, Jinyang;Yang, Tao;Zhang, Jian;Yang, Jianping;Li, Xing’ao",2016-02-15,Ceramics International,"Cu3N,Al2O3 protective layer,Optical storage,Magnetron sputtering",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.11.136,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.11.136
Effectiveness of various suspension media for electrophoretic deposition of YBCO superconductor powder,"The stability of Y1Ba2Cu3O7−δ (YBCO) suspensions in various primary aliphatic alcohols (C1C4) and in acetone has been studied by measurement of sedimentation density, electrophoretic mobility and specific conductivity. Maximum stability is observed for the suspension containing n-butanol as the dispersion medium. However, for the formation of a dense and adherent coating of YBCO on a silver substrate by electrophoretic deposition, the presence of an additive such as trichloroethylene is necessary. The best results are obtained when the trichloroethylene content of the medium is around 30 vol.%, for which the stability of the suspension is also found to be at its maximum. A mechanism for charge accumulation on the surface of YBCO particles in these suspensions has also been suggested.","Das Sharma, A.;Sen, A.;Maiti, H.S.",1993-12-31,Ceramics International, ,10.1016/0272-8842(93)90077-5,https://doi.org/10.1016/0272-8842(93)90077-5
A more representative mechanical testing of green state investment casting shell,"The influence of de-waxing method and post de-wax treatment on the flexural strength of ceramic shells has been evaluated. De-waxing by autoclave generates the highest strength when dry samples are tested, significantly stronger than when de-waxed by refrigerating. The autoclave-dewaxed shells were found not to be fully de-waxed but to have a coating of wax and some wax penetration into the face coat. This and the curing of the sol by the autoclave process were shown to be responsible for the higher strength. Treating the shells after initial de-waxing to simulate the conditions in the autoclave by either boiling in water, steaming above water or autoclaving at 180°C and 0.8MPa caused changes in the reported flexural strength. For samples initially de-waxed by autoclave the strength was reduced, boiling caused the greatest strength reduction and re-autoclaving gave the least change. Testing wet always gave lower strengths compared to dry. However, initial dry strength was never regained on further drying. The samples prepared by refrigeration lost strength when boiled or steamed but gained strength on autoclave treatment. The strength built to be 57% of the samples de-waxed by autoclave in the dry state. This occurred because the sol cured; however, the shells being essentially free from wax never gained the strength of the samples de-waxed initially by autoclave.","Lee, Kevin;Blackburn, Stuart;Welch, Stewart T.",2017-01-31,Ceramics International,"Mechanical characterisation,Ceramics,Heat treatment,Investment casting,Silica sol aging",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.09.149,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.09.149
Strengthening/toughening of 2D C/SiC composites by coating,"SiC and SiCw/SiC coatings were prepared on two-dimensional carbon fiber reinforced silicon carbide ceramic matrix composites (2D C/SiC), and strengthening/toughening of the composite by the coatings was investigated. After coating, the density of the C/SiC composites was increased effectively and the mechanical properties were improved significantly. Compared with SiC coating, SiCw/SiC coating showed the more significant effect on strength/toughness of the composites. Coatings had two effects: surface strengthening and matrix strengthening. The latter was the dominant effect. The surface strengthening can increase the crack initiation stress, while the matrix strengthening can enhance the crack propagation resistance. The former effect increased the strength and the latter effect increased the toughness.","Xie, Y.P.;Cheng, L.F.;Li, L.J.;Meng, Z.X.;Zhang, L.T.",2014-06-30,Ceramics International,"2D C/SiC composites,SiCw/SiC coating,Microstructure,Strength/toughness",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.12.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.12.007
Preparation and characterization of CoFe2O4 and CoFe2O4@Albumen nanoparticles for biomedical applications,"Biopolymer coated magnetic nanoparticles are becoming extremely popular in the fields of biomedical research because of their enormous applications potentials. In this work, first, CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (CF NPs) of two distinct sizes have been prepared following co-precipitation method by varying the synthesis parameters and characterized. XRD, SAED and IFFT (Inverse Fast Fourier Transformed) assisted HRTEM analyses confirmed the successful formation of monodispersed spinel cubic CoFe2O4 nanoparticles. Particles size of CF NPs was found to increase with increase in the amount of reducing agent. Synthesized CF NPs was coated with an egg albumen matrix by a facile and environmental friendly method to form biocompatible CoFe2O4@Albumen nanocomposite nanoparticle (CF@Alb NP). Prepared CoFe2O4 and CoFe2O4@Albumen nanoparticles were examined for its structure, morphology, thermal stability and magnetic nature employing powder XRD, HRTEM, TGA, FTIR and VSM techniques. Low as well as high magnification TEM analyses have shown coating of amorphous albumen on crystalline CF NPs. It was observed that CF@Alb NP is composed of many smaller CF NPs engulfed in the albumen matrix forming a nano-aggregate of size ∼80–130 nm. IFFT analysis of HRTEM micrograph showed presence of crystalline CF NPs in amorphous albumen matrix. Further, TGA and FTIR results also suggested the successful coating of albumen on CF NPs. CF@Alb NP has shown a very good Dox loading ability with loading efficiency of ∼93%. A promising pH dependent Dox release behavior was observed. Dox release kinetics has also been studied using different mathematical models. Biocompatibility of the CF@Alb NP has been tested against the human monocytic cell line THP-1. This novel CF@Alb NP could have a great potential in biomedical applications, particularly in hyperthermia and targeted drug delivery.","Qasim, Mohd;Asghar, Khushnuma;Das, Dibakar",2019-12-15,Ceramics International,"Nanocomposites,Magnetic properties,Ferrites,Biomedical application",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.049,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.049
Effect of in-situ oxidation on the nanomechanical evolution of Fe-base coating with ceramic particles produced by internal rotating plasma spraying,"In this work, we investigated FeCrMo coatings with 35 wt% ceramic, which were produced on a cylinder surface by an internal rotating plasma spraying and oxidized in air. The ceramic particles consisted of 80 wt% alumina and 20 wt% zirconia, which can improve the mechanical properties of the coating. For microstructural characterization, scanning electron microscopy was combined with energy dispersive X-ray analysis and electron probe micro analysis, and the nanomechanical properties were measured by a nanoindentation tester. The structure of Fe-base coating matrix consists of Al2O3, ZrO2 and a small amount of mixed Fe–Cr oxides, and the ceramic particles exhibit a uniform distribution. During oxidation, a mixed oxide layer containing Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 forms on the surface of the Fe-base coating, and the thickness of the oxide layer increases with increasing oxidation temperature. Due to the in-situ oxidation, the nanohardness and Young's modulus of the Fe-base coating decreased with increasing oxidation temperature. The nanohardness evolution of Fe-base coatings oxidized at different temperatures is discussed.","Huang, Taihong;Song, Peng;Ji, Qiang;Zhai, Ruixiong;Huang, Yong;Zheng, Biju;Yi, Jianhong",2019-11-30,Ceramics International,"In-situ oxidation,Coating,Nanohardness,Nanoindentation testing,Internal rotating plasma spraying",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.241,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.241
Preparation of a flexible high emissivity coating on quartz fiber fabric for thermal protection,"A silica-sol-bonded flexible high emissivity coating, with MoSi2 and SiC as emittance agents, was prepared on quartz fiber fabrics to improve surface radiant heat loss. The high-temperature behaviors of quartz fiber fabrics and the influence of silica sol dipping and alumina sol dipping on the fabrics were studied prior to coating preparation. The emissivity, tensile strength and bending properties of the coated fiber fabrics as functions of MoSi2 contents were investigated. Results show that the tensile strength of quartz fiber fabrics decreased sharply as temperature increased because of cristobalite crystallization. Silica sol dipping increased the tensile strength of the fabrics and therefore was selected as the binder of the high emissivity coating. The coating emissivity was higher than 0.85. The coated fiber fabrics had higher tensile strength than raw fiber fabrics and showed high bending deflection and good flexibility, resulted from the abundant microcracks formed during sol drying. The tensile strength decreased after the coated fiber fabrics were calcined at 800°C, and the coated fabrics with higher MoSi2 contents had higher tensile strength, higher toughness and better flexibility, benefited from the pesting oxidation of MoSi2, which formed an interfacial gap at the fiber–coating boundary, and promoted interfacial debonding and fiber pull out.","Tao, Xin;Zhang, Lingyu;Ma, Xiaohui;Xu, Xiaojing;Guo, Anran;Hou, Feng;Liu, Jiachen",2017-11-30,Ceramics International,"Sol-gel processes (A),Mechanical properties (C),Structural applications (E),Quartz fiber fabrics",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.181,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.181
The effect of Cu addition on the crystallization behavior and tribological properties of reactive plasma sprayed TiCN–Cu coatings,"TiCN–Cu coatings were fabricated by reactive plasma spraying using Ti-graphite aggregates and Cu powders. The crystallization, mechanical and tribological properties were investigated. The results showed that TiCN–Cu coatings shared a face-center cubic structure and they consisted of TiC0·7N0.3, TiN0·3O, Cu2O, Cu, amorphous CNx and residual graphite phases. The addition of Cu mainly changed the crystallization behavior of the coating surface and binding surface with the substrate. Compared with TiCN coating, TiCN–Cu coatings had the lower hardness and hardness distribution uniformity. The incorporation of Cu improved the coating fracture toughness, while failed to improve the coating tribological properties. The main wear mechanism of TiCN–Cu coatings in the present sliding test were adhesive wear, coupling with partial tribo-oxidation wear.","Zhao, Hongjian;Guo, Fangfang;Zhu, Lingyan;He, Jining;Yin, Fuxing",2020-04-15,Ceramics International,"TiCN-Cu coatings,Reactive plasma spraying,Crystallization,Tribological properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.066,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.066
"In vitro bonelike apatite formation on magnetite nanoparticles after a calcium silicate treatment: Preparation, characterization and hemolysis studies","Bioactive magnetite nanoparticles were prepared successfully by coating magnetite nanoparticles with CaSiO3 followed by their immersion in simulated body fluid. The Fe3O4 nanoparticles (5–10nm) were synthesized by a co-precipitation technique. In order to prepare core–shell nanocomposites, the nanoparticles were soaked for 1h in a calcium silicate solution that had been aged for 24h before using it. The samples were dried in air and then immersed in SBF at 37°C for 1, 3 and 7 days. The analyses of the samples after the biomimetic process revealed the formation of a bonelike apatite layer on all the samples tested and not a significant change was observed on their original magnetic behavior. Hemolysis test, evaluated as release of hemoglobin, revealed that all the samples showed no hemolytic effects up to 3mg/ml, indicating no damage of the red blood cell membranes. These bioactive, hemocompatible and superparamagnetic particles may be potential materials for bone cancer treatment by hyperthermia.","Múzquiz-Ramos, E.M.;Cortés-Hernández, D.A.;Escobedo-Bocardo, J.C.;Zugasti-Cruz, A.",2012-12-31,Ceramics International,"Magnetite nanoparticles,Calcium silicate,Biomimetic process,Hyperthermia",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.05.085,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.05.085
Si incorporated diamond-like carbon film-coated electrochromic switchable mirror glass for high environmental durability,"Electrochromic switchable mirror glass is promising for energy-saving windows because it changes between a reflective and a transparent state when a voltage is applied. In our previous work, we confirmed that the device degraded at high temperatures and high relative humidity using an accelerated degradation test. The degradation was related to the reaction of the moisture in atmosphere with the surface optical switching layer of the Mg–Ni thin film. Therefore, we have developed a device with a Si incorporated diamond-like carbon thin film surface layer to improve the environmental durability. When the device was kept in a simulated environment at a constant temperature of 40°C and a constant relative humidity of 60%, optical and atomic force microscopy showed that the surface did not degrade. Moreover, the surface coating repelled water, which prevented the reaction of the moisture with the Mg–Ni thin film. The optical switching speed from the transparent state to the reflective state of the device was slower than that of the uncoated device because of the fabrication conditions. The result seems to be related to the surface of the Mg–Ni layer which might be damaged by the conditions.","Tajima, Kazuki;Ikeyama, Masami;Nakao, Setsuo;Yamada, Yasusei;Yoshimura, Kazuki",2013-09-30,Ceramics International,"Switchable mirror,Thin film,Diamond-like carbon,Environment,Durability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.03.096,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.03.096
Magnetic filler alignment of paramagnetic Fe3O4 coated SiC/epoxy composite for thermal conductivity improvement,"We fabricated vertically aligned silicon carbide (SiC)/epoxy composites along the direction of heat transport using a magnetic field. SiC was made magnetically responsive by introduction of strong paramagnetic iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanospheres, and the amount of iron oxide deposited is easily controlled by modulating the precursors. Fe3O4-coated SiC filler was vertically aligned by an external magnetic field and generated particle columns. These columns act as a superior thermal conducting path. The thermal conductivity of the synthesized vertically aligned composite increased from 0.945Wm−1 K−1 to 1.681Wm−1 K−1 with 20vol% filler loading that is a 1.78-fold increase compared with the randomly dispersed filler composite. Moreover, the electrical conductivity of SiC, which is a major drawback, was also controlled by the electrically insulating iron oxide coating. These results suggest promising applications of magnetically aligned SiC-based polymer composites in thermal interface materials.","Kim, Kiho;Kim, Mihyun;Kim, Jongmin;Kim, Jooheon",2015-11-30,Ceramics International,"B.

"Hot corrosion behavior of TiO2 doped, Yb2O3 stabilized zirconia exposed to V2O5 + Na2SO4 molten salt at 700–1000°C","3.5mol% Yb2O3 stabilized zirconia (YbSZ) doped with 10mol% TiO2 (Ti-YbSZ) was produced, and its hot corrosion behavior exposed to Na2SO4 + V2O5 molten salt was investigated. The as-fabricated ceramic mainly consists of metastable tetragonal (t′) phase. When exposed to the molten salt at 700°C, 800°C, 900°C and 1000°C for 2h and 10h, YbVO4 and m-ZrO2 formed as corrosion products due to chemical reactions between the ceramics and the salt. Ti4+ in Ti-YbSZ solid solution keeps stable during the hot corrosion tests, which acts as a stabilizer for ZrO2, preventing total decomposition of the t′ phase. After the hot corrosion tests, Ti-YbSZ has an apparently lower m phase content than Y2O3 doped Zirconia and YbSZ, indicative of better corrosion resistance. The hot corrosion mechanism of Ti-YbSZ is proposed based on Lewis acid-base rule, phase diagrams and thermodynamics.","Guo, Lei;Yan, Zheng;Yu, Jianxing;Zhang, Chenglong;Li, Mingzhu;Ye, Fuxing;Ji, Vincent",2018-01-31,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Yb2O3-stabilized zirconia,Hot corrosion,V2O5 + Na2SO4",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.167,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.167
Yb3+ doping effects on thermal conductivity and thermal expansion of yttrium aluminium garnet,"Yttrium Aluminium Garnet (YAG) is an attractive candidate as thermal barrier material used for turbine blade in aero engines, due to its relatively low thermal conductivity, low oxygen diffusivity and good phase stability at high temperature. YAG has a complex crystal structure, in which Y3+ ions locate in dodecahedron and Al3+ ions in octahedron and tetrahedron. Replacing the host cations with rare earth elements can cause the structure change which influences the thermal properties of YAG. Because the space inside the octahedron is relatively small, Yb3+ ions which have the smallest ionic radial size in the lanthanide series, have been selected and attempted to be doped on dodecahedral and octahedral sites to investigate the effects on thermal conductivity and thermal expansion. The variation of lattice constant indicates that Yb3+ ions are located on the dodecahedron or octahedron. In addition, when Yb3+ ions replace Al3+ ions on octahedral sites, the thermal conductivity at room temperature is dramatically reduced and the coefficient of thermal expansion is over 10×10−6 K−1 at high temperature, which results from the expansion of octahedron due to the much larger radius of Yb3+ ion compared with the host cation (Al3+ ion). On the contrary, replacing Y3+ ions with Yb3+ ions in dodecahedron, the thermal conductivity also gradually reduces to the similar value but the coefficient of thermal expansion is getting smaller, due to the relatively small ionic radius of Yb3+ causing the contraction of the dodecahedron. Therefore, a dopant with much larger radius would be preferred in both dodecahedron and octahedron to significant reduce thermal conductivity as well as increase coefficient of thermal expansion of YAG, by introducing large radial difference between the dopant and the host cations.","Wang, Jing;Xu, Fang;Wheatley, R.J.;Neate, Nigel;Hou, Xianghui",2016-09-30,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,Yttrium aluminium garnet,Thermal conductivity,Coefficient of thermal expansion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.034,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.034
Dielectric properties of Al-doped Ti3SiC2 as a novel microwave absorbing material,"Al-doped Ti3SiC2 powders were synthesized by solid state reaction under a vacuum atmosphere from Ti/Si/TiC powders, with an optimum Al doping content. Results showed that the Ti3SiC2 major phase could be generated at a temperature as low as 1250°C through Al doping, and that the doped powders had a relatively narrow particle size distribution with a good dispersibility. The formation of Ti3Si1−xAlxC2 solid solution was further proved by XPS. The microwave dielectric parameters and reflection loss of the prepared Al-doped Ti3SiC2 samples were determined in the frequency range of 8.2–12.4GHz. It was found that the sample synthesized at 1350°C showed the high values in both the imaginary part of permittivity ε″ and dielectric loss tanδ, which were 4.39–7.32 and 0.57–0.78, respectively. For the microwave absorbing coating with a 2.6mm thickness of the sample, a better reflection loss of almost below −12dB was obtained in the whole frequency range of 8.2–12.4GHz.","Li, Zhimin;Yang, Zi;Zhang, Maolin;Yan, Yangxi;Huang, Yunxia;Hao, Yue",2017-01-31,Ceramics International,"Ti3SiC2,Al doping,Dielectric property,Microwave absorbing material",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.09.140,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.09.140
Nano size BaTiO3 powder coated with silica,"Physical characteristics of silica-coated BaTiO3 powders were studied. BaTiO3 powders (∼30nm) were coated with TEOS and ethanol, and KOH solution was used as a catalyst. As the silica content was increased, silica coating changed the surface state of BaTiO3 powders and improved dispersion of the powder. Effects of silica coating on the sintering behavior of BaTiO3 were investigated using TMA. The specimen coated with 5.0wt.% silica showed the maximum shrinkage of 25.5%, whereas the shrinkage of the uncoated BaTiO3 was 20.4%. At the silica content greater than 1.0wt.%, the characteristic X-ray peaks of fresnoite (Ba2TiSi2O8) were observed. The specimen coated with silica less than 1.0wt.% completed densification below 1250°C, whereas the specimen with greater than 3.0wt.% gave rise to swelling.","Park, Jae Sung;Han, Young Ho",2005-12-31,Ceramics International,"D.

Gradient HfB2-SiC multilayer oxidation resistant coating for C/C composites,"The gradient HfB2 modified SiC coating was prepared on the surface of SiC-coated C/C composites by in-situ synthesis. Anti-oxidation behaviors of the coated C/C samples at 1773, 1873 and 1973 K were investigated. The results show that the gradient HfB2 modified SiC coatings possess excellent oxidation resistance, which can protect C/C substrates from oxidation for 800, 305 and 100 h at 1773, 1873 and 1973 K, respectively. In addition, with the oxidation temperature increasing, the evaporation of the Hf-Si-O glass layer and the active oxidation of SiC were accelerated, which is the reason for the worst oxidation resistance of the sample at 1973 K among the three temperatures.","Wang, Peipei;Tong, Mingde;Wang, Hanhui;Li, Hejun;Jia, Yujun;Li, Bo;Zhang, Yulei;Zhao, Zhigang",2018-12-01,Ceramics International,"Carbon/carbon composites,Coating,Oxidation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.104,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.104
Flame sprayed zinc doped hydroxyapatite coating with antibacterial and biocompatible properties,"Hydroxyapatite (HA) has good biocompatibility, high strength and low fracture toughness.

The co-precipitation method prepared hydroxyapatite with different concentrations of zinc chloride. The experimental results revealed that after sintering, it has some new phases generated of ZnO and CaZn2(PO4)2 when we add zinc chloride that concentration reaches 0.15M. The minimum inhibition zone revealed the antibacterial ability of Zinc-HA increased when the concentration of zinc chloride increased from 0.0125M to 0.15M.

Preparation of oxidation protective MoSi2–SiC coating on graphite using recycled waste MoSi2 by one-step spark plasma sintering method,"In order to prepare MoSi2–SiC coating rapidly and controllably on the basis of recycling of Mo resources, waste MoSi2 heating element rods were used as raw materials to fabricate MoSi2–SiC coating on graphite substrate by SPS method through one step. Microstructural evolution and phase transformation of the coating before and after oxidation were characterized and the oxidation behaviors of deposited coating were studied in air at 1400 °C and 1200 °C. The results showed that the coating was mainly composed of MoSi2, SiC and Si, which means that the SiC phase was synthesized in a short-time sintering process. The prepared coating was about 600 μm in thickness, presenting a dense structure without any cracks. The adhesive strength of prepared coating was tested by scratch test and the adhesive strength of MoSi2–SiC coating is about 41.25 N. After high temperature oxidation, the coating surface was covered by a dense and smooth SiO2 film. The protective SiO2 film could prevent the diffusion of oxygen during oxidation. As a result, the mass change of oxidation sample followed a parabolic law and the final mass gain was 9.932 mg/cm2 after 90 h oxidation at 1400 °C.","Chen, Peng;Zhu, Lu;Ren, Xuanru;Kang, Xueqin;Wang, Xiaohong;Feng, Peizhong",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Waste MoSi2,Coating,Spark plasma sintering,Oxidation protection",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.220,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.220
The effect of thermal annealing on Fe/TiO2 coatings deposited with the help of RF PECVD method. Part II. Optical and photocatalytic properties,"In this work, morphology, optical properties, photowetting effect, and bactericidal behavior of titanium dioxide coatings, both plain and iron doped within the range of 0.52 and 4.76at%, are presented. The coatings were synthesized with the help of radio frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition technique followed by thermal annealing at 500°C under normal atmospheric conditions. Atomic force microscopy examination of the film morphology reveal roughness differences depending on the concentration of iron. Measurements of optical properties, carried out with the UV–VIS absorption spectrometry, show high transmittance in the visible range. Optical gap values, determined with the help of the Tauc equation, exhibit a decreasing tendency with an increasing iron content, but only up to the concentration of 2.5at%, with thermally annealed coatings characterized by higher Eg values than those of the non-annealed materials. Results of variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements indicate that both iron doping and thermal annealing have the effect of increasing refractive index of the films. An analysis of the coatings surface wettability, performed under conditions of an alternative exposure either to daylight or to the UV-B radiation, show the most important parameter to be the time of water contact angle return to its initial value under darkroom conditions. Finally, bactericidity studies of the UV-B irradiated samples, performed with the Escherichia coli DH5α bacteria, reveal the most extensive bactericidal effect observed for low iron concentrations, equally for both non-annealed and thermally annealed materials.","Sobczyk-Guzenda, Anna;Owczarek, Sławomir;Kołodziejczyk, Łukasz;Jakubowski, Witold;Gazicki-Lipman, Maciej;Szymanowski, Hieronim",2017-04-01,Ceramics International,"Fe/TiO2 coatings,RF PECVD,Thermal annealing,Photowettability,Photocatalysis",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.108,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.108
Corrosion resistant plasma sprayed (Y0.8Gd0.2)3Al5O12/YSZ thermal barrier coatings towards molten calcium-magnesium-alumina-silicate,"Chemical reaction between (Y0.8Gd0.2)3Al5O12 (GYAG) and calcium-magnesium- alumina-silicate (CMAS) with four different compositions was investigated. The GYAG revealed excellent chemical stability with molten CMAS even after 24 h heat-treatment at 1250 °C. A GYAG layer was sprayed onto an yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) thermal barrier coating (TBC) by plasma spray and the thermal cycling behavior and resistance to CMAS corrosion of the coating system were researched. The GYAG/YSZ TBC system exhibited a lifetime of more than 1500 h during thermal cycling testing at 1100 °C. Also, the GYAG/YSZ TBC has shown good resistance to CMAS corrosion at 1250 °C, mainly due to the chemical stability of GYAG to CMAS and dense lamellar structure of the GYAG layer. In addition, the infiltration of CMAS was further prohibited by the Ca4Y6(SiO4)6O and CaAl2Si2O8 phases generated from the reaction of (Y,Gd)AlO3 phase in the coating with the molten CMAS.","Sun, Shiyu;Xue, Zhaolu;He, Wenting;He, Jian;Li, Qiushi;Guo, Hongbo",2019-05-31,Ceramics International,"(Y0.8Gd0.2)3Al5O12,Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs),Plasma spray,CMAS,Infiltration",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.114,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.114
Processing of a glass ceramic surface by selective focused beam laser treatment,"The context of the present work is a large research project aiming at manufacturing functionalised surfaces by selected laser treatment with a focused beam [1]. More specifically, this paper aims at showing the possibility of obtaining a dense glass ceramic layer, with controlled microstructure, from a glass powder coating. In the present state of the research, laser scans are performed on glass powder compacts in order to investigate the operating conditions (power, speed and vectorisation) required to achieve the objective. The selected glass belongs to the Sr–Ti–Si–Al–K–O system, its crystalisation leads to a glass–ceramics containing piezoelectric Sr–fresnoïte crystals (Sr2TiSi2O8) Maury et al. (2011). The selective laser treatment is carried out by mean of a focused Nd–YVO4 laser beam. Characterisation of the thermal state of the surface during the treatment is performed thank to an IR camera. The surface microstructure is evaluated by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The results presented shows that Sr–fresnoïte glass ceramics layers can be processed by applying a two stage process: first the melting of a glass powder to form a dense amorphous layer; then the crystallisation of this layer. However, the microstructures resulting of a crystallisation step performed by mean of a one-scan laser treatment are heterogeneous. IR camera analysis highlights that this heterogeneity is due to thermal profile strongly depending on the position on the scanned surface. Moreover, the high energy scanning conditions required to promote crystallisation make that this later takes place on cooling after surface has been re-melted. Processing by a multi-scan mode (numerous successive rapid scans) seem more suitable. In that case, IR camera analysis shows a homogeneous thermal state of the surface. Additional investigations have to be performed in order to be able to master the relation between the thermal profile and the laser scan parameters.","Basile, Natanaël;Gonon, Maurice;Petit, Fabrice;Cambier, Francis",2016-01-31,Ceramics International,"D.

Mechanical properties of SiCf/SiC composites with PyC and the BN interface,"To tailor the fibre–matrix interface of continuous-silicon-carbide-fibre-reinforced silicon carbide (SiCf/SiC) composites for improved mechanical properties, SiC fibres were coated with pyrolytic carbon (PyC) and BN interfaces using chemical vapour deposition (CVD) and the dip-coating process, and three-dimensional SiCf/SiC composites with such interfaces were fabricated using the precursor infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP) process. The microstructures of the SiC fibres with different coatings were characterised using a scanning electron microscope. The effects of the coating processes on the tensile strengths of the SiC fibres were studied using a single-filament tensile strength test. The mechanical properties of the SiCf/SiC composites were evaluated using the three-point bending test and single-edged notch beam test. The results indicate that the SiC fibres with single-layer PyC coating have larger single-filament tensile strengths than the original fibres. The SiCf/SiC composites with a single-layer PyC coating as an interface exhibit an optimal mechanical property. The average flexural strength and fracture toughness of the single PyC-coated composites were 433.1MPa and 20.0MPam1/2, respectively.","Yang, Bei;Zhou, Xingui;Chai, Yuxin",2015-06-30,Ceramics International,"PyC,BN,Dip-coating,Precursor infiltration and pyrolysis,SiCf/SiC composites",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.02.041,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.02.041
Design and synthesis of a novel core-shell nanostructure developed for thermal energy storage purposes,"This work develops a novel plasma sprayable metal-ceramic core-shell nanostructure, which is able to store thermal energy during heating. In the course of seeking the desirable core material, a diverse set of criteria including low melting point, wide temperature range from melting to boiling point, low coefficient of thermal expansion and high heat of fusion besides the low cost for large scale production was taken into account which finally led us to Tin (Sn) as the most suitable material. To protect Sn core against oxidation, diffusion and repetitive heating/cooling cycles and to preserve the integrity of core-shell nanostructure, ZrO2 shell was selected as the protective heat resistant shell. However, due to the severe thermal mismatch between Sn core and ZrO2shell, direct coating of ZrO2 on Sn is not possible. To overcome this issue and minimizing thermally induced stresses during heating/cooling cycles, a SiO2 interlayer was used. As is evidenced by XRD, SEM, EDS and TEM, the designed Sn@SiO2@ZrO2core-shell nanostructures are successfully synthesized in this work. The formation of its core-shell structure was evidenced by EDS mapping results. The powder product exhibits an agglomerated nature. SEM results indicate that SiO2 and ZrO2 shells are porous. The final powder particles are formed from the nanoscale components including nanoscale particulate SiO2 and ZrO2 shells. DTA results clearly show the melting of the core on heating and its successive solidification on cooling. Characterization of the thermoresponse of the core-shell nanostructures demonstrates that they exhibit good heat storage characteristics and high thermal reliability for latent-heat storage.","Seyyed Afghahi, Seyyed Salman;Golestani Fard, Mohammad Amin",2019-09-30,Ceramics International,"Phase change materials,Thermal energy storage,Sn@SiO2@ZrO2 core shell nanostructures,Synthesis,Encapsulation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.091,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.091
"Calcium phosphate coatings: Morphology, micro-structure and mechanical properties","Many biomedical implant coating systems consist of micro-deposited calcium phosphate droplets thermally sprayed onto a commercially pure Ti (CP Ti) substrate. In this study, the morphology of solidified droplet “splats” was examined using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The topography of splats sprayed onto substrates at room temperature (25°C) and preheated to 100°C and 300°C was investigated. The splat shape was found to be strongly dependent on substrate preheating temperature. A homogeneous deposit density of amorphous calcium phosphate in splats deposited onto the cold substrate was confirmed by micro-Raman spectroscopy, whereas a very early stage of re-crystallization was detected using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) for splats deposited onto 300°C preheated substrates. TEM in conjunction with Focused Ion Beam (FIB) revealed the splats' ultra micro-structure. Correlation of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) with these results enabled links between different types of micro-structures and True splat contacts with the substrates to be shown. Splats deposited onto the substrate at 300°C showed generally well-adherent interfaces. The established presence of a thin layer of native oxide on this polished and preheated surface could serve to enhance the splat-substrate adhesion. Nano-indentation revealed that splats deposited onto the substrates at room temperature and 100°C have similar hardness and elastic modulus values; however, preheating the substrate up to 300°C improved these micro-mechanical properties. These combined findings promote further understanding of the extrinsic properties of the bulk calcium phosphate coating.","Saber-Samandari, Saeed;Alamara, Kadhim;Saber-Samandari, Samaneh",2014-01-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Controllable synthesis of micronano-structured LiMnPO4/C cathode with hierarchical spindle for lithium ion batteries,"LiMnPO4/C with hierarchical spindle structures was synthesized by a facile solvothermal method at 180 ℃ for 10 h. The morphology and structure of the prepared materials were controlled through the adjustment of hexamethylenetetramine (HMT). The synthesized materials were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Quantachrome instrument(Quabrasorb SI-3MP) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and so on. The prepared LiMnPO4/C exhibits good electrochemical performance, for instance, there are 153.2, 126.3, 110.2 mA h g−1 at 0.05 C, 1 C, 2 C respectively. The promising properties of the materials results from unique hierarchical nanostructures and the uniform thin carbon coating of particle surface, which improve the ionic and electronic transfer of LiMnPO4.","Cao, Yanbing;Xu, Lian;Xie, Xiaoming;Mu, Kunchang;Xie, Yongqiang;Xue, Zhichen;Hu, Guorong;Du, Ke;Peng, Zhongdong",2019-03-31,Ceramics International,"Solvothermal method,Micronano LiMnPO4/C composite,Porous hierarchical spindle structure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.186,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.186
Effect of segmented cracks on TGO growth and life of thick thermal barrier coating under isothermal oxidation conditions,"This paper is devoted to a comparative study on the isothermal oxidation of thick thermal barrier coating (TTBC) with and without segmented cracks produced by atmospheric plasma spray (APS) process. Accordingly, the growth of thermally grown oxide (TGO) and its effect on the degradation of the coating were investigated. Thick top coat in both segmented crack and conventional thick TBC reduced the double layered TGO growth rate slightly. The segmented crack thick TBC demonstrated longer isothermal oxidation life in comparison with that of the conventional thick TBC at 1100 °C. The dominant failure mechanism was spallation due to lateral cracking within the TGO and/or within TBC near the TGO layer, called mixed failure. Stress, and consequently strain, induced on the TTBC due to progressive TGO growth, seems to be primarily responsible for the crack initiation and propagation leading to the coating failure. Increment of elastic energy stored within the top coat due to the increasing of TGO thickness, finally causes thick thermal barrier coating failure in high temperature isothermal oxidation.","Izadinia, Mohammad;Soltani, Reza;Sohi, Mahmoud Heydarzadeh",2020-04-15,Ceramics International,"Thick thermal barrier coatings,High temperature oxidation,Thermally grown oxide",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.245,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.245
Behavior and mechanism of in-situ synthesis of auxiliary electrode for electrochemical sulfur sensor by calcium aluminate system,"The behavior and mechanism of in-situ synthesis of the auxiliary electrode for sulfur sensor were investigated in this work, aiming for better application of calcium aluminate system in synthesizing the auxiliary electrode used for sulfur sensor. The in-situ reaction experiment was developed. In addition, the thermodynamic and kinetic calculations were adopted to further study the in-situ reaction possibility and the reaction rate. The results indicated that the value of lg(a [S]/a [O]) should be greater than a particular value to ensure the occurrence of the in-situ reaction. After immersion into the molten iron, the CaS phase was synthesized in the calcium aluminate system. The relationship between the reaction rate and reaction time was exponential, and the initial reaction rate was affected by the CaO content incorporated in the calcium aluminate system and the sulfur content in the molten iron. The initial in-situ reaction rate greatly increased with the increase of the CaO content and sulfur content. For example, the initial reaction rate was as high as 14.87 s-1 when the calcium aluminate system containing 60 wt% of CaO and for a sulfur content of 0.077 wt% in the molten iron. Moreover, the reason that the sulfur sensor fabricated by the ZrO2(MgO) tube with the calcium aluminate coating with different components had the same response time when measuring the different sulfur contents in the molten iron was further explained.","Wen, Tianpeng;Yu, Jingkun;Yuan, Lei;Jin, Endong;Liu, Tao;Tian, Chen;Zhou, Yuting",2020-03-31,Ceramics International,"Calcium aluminate,Auxiliary electrode,Mechanism,Thermodynamics,Kinetics",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.146,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.146
Transient thermal stress due to the penetration of calcium-magnesium-alumino-silicate in EB-PVD thermal barrier coating system,"Electron beam-physical vapor deposited (EB-PVD) thermal barrier coating system (TBCs) are vulnerable to the degradations induced by the penetration of calcium- magnesium-alumino-silicate (CMAS). In this work, we conduct a numerical study to investigate the effect of CMAS penetration on the development of transient thermal stress in EB-PVD TBCs with the columnar microstructure. A two-dimensional periodical model is developed, taking into account the columnar microstructure of EB-PVD TBCs and the CMAS penetration. We found that the CMAS penetration would induce a field of high in-plane tensile stress in TC upon the rapid cooling, promoting the initiation of the vertical cracks from top surface toward to the bottom of TC. Meanwhile, the accumulation of out-of-plane tensile stress tends to occur at the side edges of EB-PVD columns near three main regions: closely beneath the top surface of TC, at the interface between CMAS penetrated and non-penetrated zone, and close to the TC/BC interface. Therefore, the horizontal cracks are likely to initiate from the side edges of EB-PVD columns at these three regions, which agrees well with experiments.","Zhang, Guanghui;Fan, Xueling;Xu, Rong;Su, Luochuan;Wang, T.J.",2018-08-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating (TBC),CMAS,Transient thermal stress,Crack",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.065,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.065
"Structural, optical and photocatalytic properties of ZnO nanorods: Effect of aging time and number of layers","ZnO thin films were prepared by sol–gel dip coating method onto glass substrates. The effects of aging time of the starting solution (2, 10 and 30 days) and the number of coats (2, 5 and 10 coatings) on structural, morphological and optical properties were investigated. Photocatalytic efficiency was also assessed. X-ray diffraction analysis indicates that all the films exhibit a Zincite-type structure with a preferred grains orientation along the [002] direction. The preferred orientation factor (POF) increases with aging time while the crystallite size decreases. The field emission scanning electron microscopy observations reveals nanorods morphology. The length of ZnO nanorods increase with increasing number of layers whereas their length decreases as a function of aging time while adopting a random orientation. A high optical transparency is observed for all ZnO thin films, ranging from 90 up to 96%. Methylene Blue (MB) dye photocatalytic degradation was found increases with aging time, reaching almost 94% after 10h under UV irradiation. The apparent reaction rate (K app) obtained by Langmuir-Hinshelwood model increases with increasing aging time from, from 0.218h−1 for 2 days to reach a steady state around 0.270h−1. Nevertheless, a small variation of K app was recorded when varying the number of coats; 0.223–0.226h−1.","Toubane, M.;Tala-Ighil, R.;Bensouici, F.;Bououdina, M.;Cai, W.;Liu, S.;Souier, M.;Iratni, A.",2016-06-30,Ceramics International,"ZnO nanorods,Aging time,Coats number,AFM,SEM,Photocatalysis",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.03.056,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.03.056
The effect of temperature and roughness of the substrate surface on the microstructure and adhesion strength of EB-PVD ZrO2-%8wtY2O3 coating,"Thermal barrier coatings are of great interest in increasing the working temperature and thus, improving the efficiency of turbine engines. In this study, coating was conducted on nickel-base superalloy substrates using physical vapor deposition process and the electron beam evaporation technique of Yttria-stabilized Zirconia discs. In order to characterize the coatings including microstructure, topography and phase structure, field emission scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis were used, respectively. The scratch test was also used to evaluate the adhesion strength of the coating. It was observed that at the temperature of 470 °C, the coating has no preferential orientation. By increasing the substrate temperature to 750 °C, the intensity of the peak (211) was reduced, while that of the peak (101) was sharply increased, such that at the substrate temperature of 750 °C, the coating had only the preferred orientation (101). Increasing the substrate temperature from 470 °C to 750 °C enhanced the critical force (Lc) from 8.2 N to 25.1 N. Increasing the substrate roughness from 0.55 μm to 3.43 μm enhanced the coating roughness from 0.62 μm to 3.71 μm raised the columnar diameter from 36.98 nm to 120.9 nm and reduced the critical force (Lc) from 18 N to 6.3 N.","Ostadi, Ali;Hosseini, Seyyed Hojjatollah;Fordoei, Mohammadreza Ebrahimi",2020-02-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,EB-PVD process,Substrate temperature,Substrate surface roughness,Adhesion strength",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.217,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.217
Adsorbability and spreadability of calcium-magnesium-alumino-silicate (CMAS) on Al-modified 7YSZ thermal barrier coating,"A dense α-Al2O3 overlay was in-situ synthesized on 7YSZ TBC to mitigate the CMAS attack. The adsorbability and spreadability of CMAS on as-sprayed and Al-modified TBCs were investigated. The results show that compared to the as-spared TBC, the Al-modified TBC has lower adsorption mass and smaller spreading area. When the Al-modified 7YSZ coating was subjected to CMAS attack, the presence of large amounts of Al2O3 will accelerate the formation of MgAl2O4 spinel and induce the generation of CaAl2O4 spinel apart from gehlenite Ca2Al2SiO7. Therefore, it can be concluded that Al-modified 7YSZ TBC has better CMAS corrosion resistance than as-sprayed TBC.","Zhang, X.F.;Zhou, K.S.;Liu, M.;Deng, C.M.;Deng, C.G.;Deng, Z.Q.",2016-12-31,Ceramics International,"Al modification,α-Al2O3 overlay,CMAS corrosion,Adsorbability,Spreadability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.09.106,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.09.106
Evaluation of plasma sprayed alumina–40wt% titania and partially stabilized zirconia coatings on high density graphite for uranium melting application,"Ceramic coatings have been proposed on high density graphite crucibles for the application of uranium consolidation and distillation of molten salt in pyrochemical reprocessing of metallic fuels.

The coated high density graphite samples were characterized before and after uranium melting test by scanning electron microscopy attached with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Microstructural observations revealed that no significant reaction layer or product was formed between uranium and PSZ coating, while uranium significantly adhered to A40T coating.

Combustion synthesis of pink chromium-doped alumina with excellent near-infrared reflective properties,"Pink chromium-doped alumina, Al1.95Cr0.05O3, was prepared by microwave assisted combustion synthesis, starting from a stoichiometric mixture of Al(NO3)3·9H2O, Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and urea. No additional annealing was required, as the X-ray diffraction pattern of the sample indicated that Al1.95Cr0.05O3 was the single crystalline phase, having an average crystallite size of 63nm. The resulted powder had a pink colour (L*=83.1, a*=4.2, b*=−2.9) and a total solar reflectance of 69.2%. The pigment had a BET surface area of 1.8m2/g, which corresponds to an equivalent particle size of 838nm.

Enhanced cyclic stability at elevated temperature of spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 by Li4Ti5O12 coating as cathode material for high voltage lithium ion batteries,"The cyclic stability of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 at elevated temperature is a crucial factor for commercial Li-ion batteries. To improve the capacity retention of the spinel cathode material, surface modification has been widely recognized as one of the most effective approaches. In this work, a continuous and uniform layer assembled with nanoscale Li4Ti5O12 particles was coated on LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 via hydrothermal method with moderate temperature. With a coating quantity of 0.5 wt%, the as-prepared LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4@ Li4Ti5O12 delivers an initial special discharge capacity of 141.2 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C and retention of 93.66% after 500 cycles at 1 C at room temperature, and it exhibits capacity retention of 97.03% after 140 cycles at 1 C at 55 °C. In addition to the protective effect against electrolyte, from observation on the surface feature during long term lithium insertion/extraction process, the Li4Ti5O12 coating layer suppresses the continuous growth of a dense and cathode electrolyte interfaces from the electrolyte decomposition.","Wu, Qiang;Xue, Ke;Zhang, Xiaohui;Xie, Xuesong;Wang, Hongqiang;Zhang, Jiujun;Li, Qingyu",2019-03-31,Ceramics International,"Lithium ion batteries,High voltage cathode,LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4,Surface modification",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.209,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.209
Evaluation of structural and mechanical properties of aerosol-deposited bioceramic films for orthodontic brackets,"Four types of bioceramic films (Al2O3, SiO2, hydroxyapatite (HA), and brushite) were prepared via a simple aerosol deposition (AD) process at room temperature, and their structural and mechanical characteristics were compared to verify their potential for use in orthodontic brackets. The results showed that the HA and brushite films featured considerably high deposition rates compared with other coating technologies. Moreover, it was revealed that the crystallite size of all samples was largely reduced below 100 nm, which can enhance the biological performance and mechanical properties of bioceramic films. The HA and brushite films also had optimum mechanical properties, namely, adhesive strength and shear bond strength. These two instrumental mechanical properties were believed to be achieved by not only thicker bumps due to the high deposition rate but also strong mechanical interlocking at the ceramic-to-resin interface. This study confirmed that AD-prepared HA and brushite films have high potential for application in orthodontic brackets.","Cho, Myung-Yeon;Lee, Dong-Won;Kim, Ik-Soo;Kim, Won-Jung;Koo, Sang-Mo;Lee, Daeseok;Kim, Yoon-Hyun;Oh, Jong-Min",2019-04-15,Ceramics International,"Bioceramic films,Aerosol deposition,Orthodontic bracket,Structural characteristics,Adhesive strength,Shear bond strength",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.159,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.159
"Two-step method to deposit ZrO2 coating on carbon fiber: Preparation, characterization, and performance in SiC composites","Recently, ceramic matrix composites reinforced by short carbon fibers (CFs) attracted increasing attentions. To further improve mechanical properties and oxidation resistances, CFs were subjected to oxidation and acidification followed by sol-gel dip-coating to deposit ZrO2 on their surfaces. ZrO2-Cf/SiC composites were fabricated by joint hot compression molding and sintering, compared to Cf/SiC and SiC prepared by the same method. Microstructural analyses indicated that ZrO2 coatings were successfully deposited on CF surfaces, formed strong bonding and interfaces between CF and the matrix. Meanwhile, CFs were found uniformly distributed in SiC matrix with random orientations. Flexural curves of ZrO2-Cf/SiC and Cf/SiC revealed the presence of “False plasticity” regions after sharp drops, which were quite different from brittle flexural behavior of SiC ceramic. Compression strength of the three samples showed step-up growth. ZrO2-Cf/SiC exhibited the highest value, indicating the introduction of CFs and ZrO2 coatings do have great influence on mechanical performances. After heat treatment, ZrO2-Cf/SiC exhibited better oxidation resistance than Cf/SiC, with weight loss ratios estimated to − 3.76% and − 6.43%, respectively. These improved properties indicated that ZrO2-Cf/SiC would be excellent alternatives to other existence materials under ultra-high temperature environments.","Tang, Chen;Li, Tiehu;Bai, Yuhang;Gao, Junjie;Yang, Wenbo;Jiao, Shasha;Zhao, Tingkai",2018-07-31,Ceramics International,"Ceramic matrix composites,Short carbon fiber,ZrO2 coating,Modification process,Sol-gel dip-coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.268,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.268
"Properties and performance of photocatalytic CeO2, TiO2, and CeO2–TiO2 layered thin films","CeO2, TiO2, and CeO2–TiO2 layered thin films of different compositions were deposited on polished fused silica glass substrates using spin coating and then annealed at 550 °C for 1 h. Poorly crystalline fluorite-type CeO2 and anatase-type TiO2 were the only phases detected. The valence effects for Ce are attributed to intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) while those for TiO2 are attributed to simultaneous Ti4+ → Ti3+ redox and IVCT. Contamination of the grain boundaries by Si from the substrate is likely to have contributed to blockage of surface-active sites. While the roughnesses of the former thin films exhibited the expected direct correlation with the grain size, those of the latter two types of thin films showed a converse relation, suggesting that the grain boundaries of the layered TiO2 thin films included a recrystallized CeO2–TiO2 invariant point liquid and/or a CeO2–TiO2–SiO2 glass. These would have derived from the other sources of grain boundary contamination, which are Si contamination from the substrate and/or exsolved CeO2 beyond the solubility limit of TiO2. The UV–Vis spectra demonstrated two principal types of curves, with the CeO2 and higher TiO2 concentration giving typical spectra with sharp absorption edges while those of the lower TiO2 concentration indicated highly defective nanostructures with diffuse absorption edges. These data support the conclusion that CeO2 initially decreases the Eg by enhancing nucleation and recrystallization through defect formation but subsequently increases the Eg through supersaturation and consequent lattice distortion. The CeO2 thin films exhibited much worse photocatalytic performances than those of the TiO2 thin films, although no significant differences between the TiO2 thin films and the CeO2–TiO2 layered thin films were apparent, which probably resulted from the competing effects of blockage of the active sites on the grain boundaries and the extent of recrystallization of the thin film phases, the latter of which is more significant.","Kumar, Vishesh;Chen, Wen-Fan;Zhang, Xichao;Jiang, Yue;Koshy, Pramod;Sorrell, Charles Christopher",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Ceria,Titania,Thin film,Photocatalysis",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.225,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.225
Black plasma-sprayed Ta2O5 coatings with photothermal effect for bone tumor therapy,"In this work, a black vacuum-plasma-sprayed Ta2O5 coating (VTO) was fabricated using white Ta2O5 powder as a raw material. Interestingly, a gray Ta2O5 coating was obtained by heat treatment of VTO coating (HVTO). The morphology, phase composition, photothermal conversion and cancer therapy effect in vitro of VTO and HVTO were comprehensively evaluated.

Thermally stable current-collecting silver grid coated with ceramic-capping layer for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,"In an effort to decrease the operating temperature of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), nano-porous thin Pt layers have been used as a cathode material with catalytic activity. Because of porous and thin characteristic of the Pt cathode, however, a large cathode area results in a significant performance deterioration because of the increased sheet resistance of the Pt cathode. In this study, we developed a Ag-patterned grid as a current-collecting layer and a samaria-doped ceria (SDC) oxide-capping layer on the porous Pt cathode to decrease sheet resistance and enhance electrochemical performance. Enhanced electron transportation and thermo-stable behavior of fabricated fuel cells indicated three-fold enhanced peak power density and more than two-fold thermomechanical stability, as per scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical analysis results.","Hong, Soonwook;Lim, Yonghyun;Prinz, Fritz B.;Kim, Young-Beom",2018-12-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,Samaria-doped ceria (SDC),Oxide-capping layer,Silver current collector,Low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.340,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.340
Enhanced corrosion resistance of hydroxyapatite/magnesium-phosphate-composite-coated AZ31 alloy co-deposited by electrodeposition method,"Magnesium-phosphate-doped hydroxyapatite (HAMP, Mg3(PO4)2-Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) and magnesium-hydrogen-phosphate-doped dicalcium-phosphate-dehydrate (DCPD-MHP, MgHPO4-CaHPO4) composite coatings were successfully electrodeposited onto an AZ31 alloy, and their corrosion behaviour was evaluated via electrochemical and in vitro degradation tests. In addition, the stability of the coatings was evaluated via these electrochemical tests. The results showed that the corrosion resistance and stability of the composite coatings were both significantly higher than those of single coatings; this greater resistance and stability resulted from the denser and more uniform structures of the composite coatings.","Li, Bing;Chen, Yun;Huang, Wei;Yang, Wenzhong;Yin, Xiaoshuang;Liu, Ying",2016-08-15,Ceramics International,"HAMP,DCPD-MHP,Corrosion resistance,Corrosion behaviour,Electrodeposite",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.090,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.090
Impact-induced bonding and boundary amorphization of TiN ceramic particles during room temperature vacuum cold spray deposition,Vacuum cold spray (VCS) has been developed as a competent technique for room temperature bulk coating fabrication of solid ceramic particles. Here we report formation and densification mechanisms of VCS TiN ceramic coatings as elucidated by characterizing their microstructures at particle/substrate and particle/particle interfaces. TEM observation reveals apparent fracturing and plastic deformation of TiN particles during impact deposition. The deformation located at the interfacial areas exhibits a dislocation density of ~5×1017/m2. Formation of an amorphous layer with the width of 3–4nm at the fringes of the ceramic particles is revealed. Impact velocity and high strain rate of TiN particles as determined by numerical computation further indicates the substantial role of the impact-induced plastic deformation in regulating the fabrication of the coatings.

Bone marrow absorption and retention properties of engineered scaffolds with micro-channels and nano-pores for tissue engineering: A proof of concept,"We have developed a hydroxyapatite-based scaffold with micro-channels and nano-pores (MCNP) using a polyurethane template coating method to overcome some of the limitations by addressing fluid absorbance and retention via capillary action. The novel scaffold has 3 basic structures. First, the scaffold has a porous trabecular network similar to that of human trabecular bones (300–400um) which are mechanically matched to the strength of native trabecular bone (2–12MPa). Second, it has micro-sized channels (25–70um) within each trabecular septum which exhibit highly effective fluid absorption via capillary action. Third, the surface of each septum has nano-sized pores (100–400nm) that allow immobilized cells to anchor. The surface area of the scaffold with micro-channels was significantly (+42.0%) higher than the scaffold without micro-channels as calculated using computer aided design (CAD) software, while overall porosity did not change significantly (+8.8%). Combinatorial effects of these internal structures result in a host-adapting construct that enhances cell ingress and retention from the host bone marrow throughout the entire scaffold.","Oh, Daniel S.;Hyuk Kim, Yoon;Ganbat, Danaa;Han, Myung-Ho;Lim, Phillip;Back, Jung-Ho;Lee, Francis Y.;Tawfeek, Hesham",2013-09-30,Ceramics International,"Tissue engineering,Microenvironment,Capillary action,Bone marrow ingress and retention",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.04.021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.04.021
SiC coating toughened by SiC nanowires to protect C/C composites against oxidation,"A dense SiC coating toughened by SiC nanowires was prepared on carbon/carbon (C/C) composites using a two-step technique of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to protect them against oxidation. The morphologies and crystalline structures of the coatings were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. SiC nanowires played a role in decreasing the size of the cracks and improving the thermal shock resistance of the coating. The result of thermal shock between 1773K and room temperature for 21 times indicates that, compared with the SiC coating without SiC nanowires, the average size of the cracks in the SiC coating toughened with SiC nanowires reduced from 5±0.5 to 3±0.5μm. The weight loss of the SiC coated C/C composites decreased from 9.32 to 4.45% by the introduction of SiC nanowires.","Chu, Yanhui;Fu, Qiangang;Li, Hejun;Wu, Heng;Li, Kezhi;Tao, Jun;Lei, Qin",2012-01-31,Ceramics International,"D.

Preparation and electrochemical properties of Al/TiB2/β-PbO2 layered composite electrode materials for electrowinning of nonferrous metals,"In this paper, an Al/TiB2 layered composite was prepared by plasma spraying for use as the base material to reduce resistivity and improve electrochemical performance in an electrode. The β-PbO2 coating was prepared by electrochemical deposition. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to study the Al/TiB2 composite and the β-PbO2 coating. The electrochemical performance of the Al/TiB2/β-PbO2 and Ti/β-PbO2 composites was studied by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), Tafel polarization curves (Tafel) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results indicate that Al/TiB2/β-PbO2 composite electrode materials with a uniform structure were successfully prepared by plasma spraying and electrochemical deposition. The structure of the Al/TiB2 composite improves the conductivity of the electrode matrix, the optimal value of conductivity is 2.76 × 107 S m−1, and the optimal value of density is 8.758 g cm−3 for β-PbO2 coating. The composite also decreases the charge resistance in the double layer structure of the electrode surface, accelerating the charge transfer rate.

Sandwich structure of carbon-coated silicon/carbon nanofiber anodes for lithium-ion batteries,"For electrospun silicon/carbon nanofiber composites, the surface precipitation of silicon nanoparticles can cause poor cycle stability. To solve this, a carbon-coated silicon/carbon nanofiber (Si/C@C) composite with a ‘sandwich’ structure is constructed by hydrothermal reaction of glucose and an electrospun silicon/carbon nanofiber, followed by high-temperature carbonization. The effects of the thickness of the carbon coating layer and calcining temperature on the electrochemical performance are studied. The results showed that carbon is uniformly and continuously coated on the surface of the composite fibers, which avoid direct exposure of precipitated silicon on the surface of the nanofibers to the electrolyte, reduce the occurrence of side reactions and is conducive to the stable formation of SEI films. At the same time, the carbon shell inhibit the volume expansion of silicon to a certain extent and improve the conductivity of the composites. Consequently, the obtained Si/C@C exhibit good rate performance and cycle stability. With the optimised carbon coating thickness and calcination temperature, the obtained electrodes deliver a reversible capacity of 1120 and 683 mA h g-1 at a current density of 0.1 and 2 A g-1 respectively, and a specific capacity of 602 mAh∙g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 after 100 cycles, a capacity retention rate of 80%. The facilely synthesised Si/C@C composite shows potential applications in high-capacity silicon-based anode materials.","Li, Yaru;Wang, Ruyi;Zhang, Jiwei;Chen, Jianping;Du, Chenqiang;Sun, Tianhua;Liu, Jian;Gong, Chunhong;Guo, Jianhui;Yu, Laigui;Zhang, Jingwei",2019-09-30,Ceramics International,"Electrospinning,Si/C nanofiber,Carbon coating,Lithium-ion batteries,Anode",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.141,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.141
The effect of boron additive on the oxidation resistance of SiC-protected graphite,"To improve the oxidation resistance of graphite, SiC is often used as a coating material because of its stability at high temperatures. A protective SiC layer was produced on graphite by Si slurry dipping and reaction sintering at 1600°C for 4 h. The oxidation resistance of the treated graphite was influenced by the amount of boron added to the Si slurry. Instead of being determined by thermodynamics via the SiB eutectic, the result of reaction sintering was greatly influenced by the wetting ability of SiB on the graphite surface. The reaction sintered layer is a composite of SiC and the unreacted graphite matrix. As the coated sample encounters oxygen attack at high temperature, the main path of oxidation is through the unreacted matrix in the reaction layer. Values of oxidation activation energy were found to be, in order, 22·0, 14·0 and 6·5 kcal/mol, over the temperature range 700–1050°C. These changes in activation energy imply a mechanism change for graphite oxidation. The amount of boron added to the Si influenced the state of the sintered SiC layer. A transition temperature as high as 950°C was found in the case of 7·5 wt% boron addition. This means that oxygen transport through the SiC remained the controlling mechanism up to 950°C.","Wu, Tsung-Ming;Wei, Wen-Cheng;Hsu, Shu-En",1992-12-31,Ceramics International, ,10.1016/0272-8842(92)90091-Q,https://doi.org/10.1016/0272-8842(92)90091-Q
Electrochemical aspects and in vitro biocompatibility of polypyrrole/TiO2 ceramic nanocomposite coatings on 316L SS for orthopedic implants,"With a view to developing a smart coating combining both biocompatibility and corrosion resistance over bioimplants, polypyrrole/TiO2 nanocomposite coatings were electrochemically synthesized by cyclic voltammetric technique on 316L stainless steel (SS) in an aqueous solution of oxalic acid. The presence of TiO2 nanoparticles in polypyrrole (PPy) matrix was confirmed using FT-IR spectroscopy and XRD analysis. The surface morphology of coated 316L SS substrates was observed by the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Microhardness of coated 316L SS was examined by the Vickers hardness method. The electrochemical studies were carried out using Cyclic Polarization and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. In order to describe the biocompatibility, contact angle measurements and in vitro characterization were carried out in Simulated Body Fluid (SBF) solution.

Microstructure and oxidation resistance of a NiCrAlY/Al2O3-sprayed coating on Ti-19Al-10Nb-V alloy,"A Ti3Al (α2) alloy (Ti-19Al-10Nb-3V, wt%) coated by air plasma spraying (APS) with Ni22Cr10AlY and Ni22Cr10AlY/Al2O3 has been tested against cyclic oxidation in air at 850°C for 10 cycles of 10h each. Effects of pre-oxidation and cyclic oxidation treatments, both in air, on the microstructure of the single α2/Ni22Cr10AlY and double coated α2 /Ni22Cr10AlY/Al2O3 specimens were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), SEM-EDS and Raman spectroscopy. Several distinct results appear through the cyclic oxidization of the pre-oxidized α2 /Ni22Cr10AlY, namely, elemental diffusion where Ti and Al diffuses from one side and Ni and Cr from the other side, oxygen is found to be present at the support-bond coat interface and a partial reaction of the superficial NiO with α-Al2O3 to form the non-protective NiAl2O4 takes place. Conversely, pre-oxidation treatment of the double coated α2 /Ni22Cr10AlY/Al2O3 specimens causes transient alumina polymorphs obtained by APS to convert to α-Al2O3 and hence to ensure the lowest cyclic oxidation rate seen by a k p value of 2.62×10−12 g2 cm−4 s−1. Good adhesion to support of all the coated specimens is recorded following the cyclic oxidization treatment.","Anghel, Elena Maria;Marcu, Maria;Banu, Alexandra;Atkinson, Irina;Paraschiv, Alexandru;Petrescu, Simona",2016-08-01,Ceramics International,"A.

Interfacial reaction behavior and bonding mechanism between liquid Sn and ZrO2 ceramic exposed in ultrasonic waves,"Ultrasound-assisted dipping of ZrO2 ceramics into molten Sn solder was performed to realize the low-temperature joining of ZrO2 ceramics in this study. Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectrometer, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were employed to study the effects of ultrasonic vibration on the microstructure of Sn/ZrO2 interface, and to elucidate the joining mechanism between Sn coating layer and ZrO2 ceramic. Results showed that, after ultrasonically dipping in molten Sn for 1200s, a pure Sn solder layer with a thickness of approximately 8–9µm was coated on the ZrO2 surface. The Sn coating layer exhibited excellent metallurgic bonding with ZrO2 ceramic. A nano-sized ZrSnO4 ternary phase, which was beneficial to the smooth transition of the lattice from Sn solder to ZrO2 ceramic, was formed at the Sn/ZrO2 interface. The formation of ZrSnO4 interlayer was ascribed to the acoustic cavitation induced high-temperature reaction of Sn, O and ZrO2 at the molten Sn/ZrO2 ceramic interface. The tested average shear strength of ZrO2/Sn/ZrO2 joints was approximately 32MPa, and the shearing failure mainly took place within the Sn solder layer.","Luo, Dan;Xiao, Yong;Wang, Ling;Liu, Li;Zeng, Xian;Li, Mingyu",2017-07-31,Ceramics International,"ZrO2 ceramic,Pure Sn,Ultrasound-assisted dipping,ZrSnO4",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.042,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.042
"Comparative study on the electrochemical performance of LiFePO4 cathodes fabricated by low temperature 3D printing, direct ink writing and conventional roller coating process","Electrodes for lithium-ion batteries can be fabricated in many ways including conventional roller coating and 3D printing. Roller coating is a standardized process in current lithium-ion battery industry, while 3D printing has been used to fabricate three-dimensional (3D) unconventional electrodes with tailored geometries. Our previous study proposed a low temperature 3D printing process to fabricate highly-porous LiFePO4 (LFP) electrodes. However, there still lack a study on the comparison of electrochemical performance of LFP electrodes fabricated via the three different fabrication processes including low temperature direct writing-based 3D printing (LTDW), room temperature direct ink writing (DIW) and roller coating process. In this study, we fabricated LFP cathodes using these three fabrication processes from LFP inks with different solid contents. By varying the solid content, LFP electrodes with different geometries (including width and thickness), morphologies and porous microstructures were obtained via LTDW and DIW. Mercury porosimetry was performed to examine the differences of the three types of LFP electrodes in porous microstructures. Electrochemical performance including charge/discharge, rate performance, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the three types of electrodes were measured and compared. Results showed that electrode fabrication processes have important effects on the electrochemical performance of LFP electrodes depending on the ink solid content. LTDW-fabricated electrodes had the best performance at high solid content (≥0.467 g/mL) and conventional roller coated electrodes performed better at low solid content (≤0.356 g/mL). Relationships between ink solid content, fabrication process, resulting porous microstructures and electrochemical performance were discussed. Finally, an optimal specific capacity of ∼82 mAh.g-1 @ 10C was achieved at a solid content of 0.467 g/mL by LTDW process.","Liu, Changyong;Xu, Feng;Cheng, Xingxing;Tong, Junda;Liu, Yanliang;Chen, Zhangwei;Lao, Changshi;Ma, Jun",2019-08-01,Ceramics International,"Low temperature direct writing,3D printing,LiFePO4,Lithium-ion battery,Cathode",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.124,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.124
The effects of Cr and Si additions and deposition conditions on the structure and properties of the (Zr-Ti-Nb)N coatings,"In this study, (Zr-Ti-Nb)N, (Zr-Ti-Cr-Nb)N and (Zr-Ti-Cr-Nb-Si)N nitride coatings were obtained using a well-developed vacuum arc deposition. The systematical investigations demonstrate that the chemical composition, microstructure, and properties of the coatings intimately rely on the deposition parameters (pressure of working gas and substrate bias). Effects of Cr and Si additions on microstructure and mechanical properties of the (Zr-Ti-Nb)N coatings have been investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectrum (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), hardness measurements and adhesion testing. First-principles band-structure calculations and Gibbs-Rosenbaum triangle representation have been used to investigate the elemental and phase compositions in nitride coatings. The multi-component (Zr-Ti-Cr-Nb-Si)N and (Zr-Ti-Nb)N coatings are found to be a simple face-centered cubic (FCC) solid solution. For the coatings without Si, the structure is mainly composed of TiN fcc phase and Cr2N trigonal modification. The hardness values were in the ranges (24–42GPa). The (Zr-Ti-Nb)N, (Zr-Ti-Cr-Nb)N coatings provided the best adhesive strength in different conditions. The (Zr-Ti-Cr-Nb-Si)N coatings exhibited the worst adhesive strength, which may be attributed to the relative low hardness.","Pogrebnjak, A.D.;Bagdasaryan, A.A.;Beresnev, V.M.;Nyemchenko, U.S.;Ivashchenko, V.I.;Kravchenko, Ya.O.;Shaimardanov, ZH.K.;Plotnikov, S.V.;Maksakova, O.",2017-01-31,Ceramics International,"Nitrides,Vacuum deposition,Hardness,Adhesion,First-principles bandstructure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.008
Development of ZrO2 and YSZ coatings deposited by PE-CVD below 800 °C for the protection of Ni alloys,"One possibility to increase the safety of structural Ni alloys is the use of yttria stabilized zirconia coatings in order to avoid deleterious thermal effects on their mechanical properties and corrosion resistance above 800 °C. However, the deposition of YSZ with a fully cubic structure below 800 °C cannot be achieved by traditional processing routes. In this work, we show the deposition of ZrO2 and Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 coatings by Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PE-CVD). To this purpose, the effect of deposition temperature (500–800 °C), plasma power (50–250 W) and precursor concentration (0.5–2 g) on the microstructure, composition and crystalline phase of ZrO2 and YSZ coatings was studied. Contrary to previous reports, we show that it is feasible to use zirconium (IV) acetylacetonate [Zr (acac)4] to produce nanostructured zirconia coatings with low carbon content (1.8 at.%) and metastable tetragonal phase. A fully cubic YSZ structure was achieved with the use of Y-acetylacetonate with concentrations above 12 mol% at 700 °C and obtain a columnar microstructure.","Espinoza-Pérez, L.J.;López-Honorato, Eddie;González, Luis A.",2020-07-31,Ceramics International,"Zirconia,Zr-acetylacetonate,PE-CVD,Environmental barriers,Coatings rate,Carbon",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.109,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.109

The coatings morphology presents hexagonal grains perpendicularly oriented to the surface. Under DC conditions, TiO2 content of the coatings decreased with increasing TiO2 concentration of the electrolyte. Increasing applied current and TiO2 concentration in the bath leads to a fine microstructure with corrosion currents as low as 2.7µA/cm2.

Free-standing coatings were isothermally annealed at 1315°C for different times and their crystal structure was studied by XRD. No phase decomposition occurred. Columnar grains grew in the molten splats with increasing annealing time according to a preferential direction and, after 50h of heat treatment, they were partially replaced by equiaxed grains. Both in-plane and out-of-plane thermal expansion coefficients (CTEs) were measured from coating expansion during heating. The CTE was slightly sensitive to thermal exposure in out-of-plane direction, whereas it kept almost constant in plane direction. The specific heat capacity Cp of annealed coatings, measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), decreased in comparison with as-sprayed coating, due to high-temperature sintering.","Di Girolamo, Giovanni;Blasi, Caterina;Schioppa, Monica;Tapfer, Leander",2010-04-30,Ceramics International,"C.

The Al2O3 coatings were amorphous of good stoichiometry and their surface was undulated and continuous. The Ni-based buffer layer played a key role on improving the adhesion of the Al2O3 coatings to the substrate.

"The hydration resistance, evolution mechanism of sol-coated aluminum and its effect on mechanical properties of SiC reticulated porous ceramics","As the key component for porous media burner, the sufficient strength of SiC reticulated porous ceramics (RPCs) is necessary due to the scour of hot flue gas. However, SiC RPCs prepared with template replica method often exhibited serious oxidation and low strength when the foam was burnt out. In the present work, a sol-coated Al powder with high hydration resistance was introduced into the silicon carbide slurry to promote mullite formation in SiC skeleton, meanwhile reduce the SiC oxidation ratio of sample during the heat treatment. Firstly, the silica-sol coated Al with uniform silica-sol was successfully prepared via dip coating to improve the ability of hydration resistance of Al powder. Furthermore, sol-coated Al with spherical morphology improved rheological properties of silicon carbide slurry, including viscosity and rheological behavior. In addition, the evolution mechanism of sol-coated Al in SiC RPCs was revealed. The AlO2(g) and AlO(g) was first formed in the system, thus significantly reducing the SiC oxidation ratio in SiC RPC. The partial pressure of AlO(g) increased with the sintering temperature, the needle-shaped mullite formed at 1300 ○C when it dissolved in the microsilica, while lumpy mullite formed as SiC was the silica source in SiC RPCs. The addition of sol-coated Al was beneficial to optimize the microstructure of SiC skeleton, resulting in higher compressive strength of SiC RPCs.","Liang, Xiong;Li, Yawei;Sang, Shaobai;Wang, Qinghu;He, Zhu;Li, Benwen",2020-06-01,Ceramics International,"Sol-coated Al,Hydration resistance,Rheological property,Microstructure evolution,Mechanical properties,SiC reticulated porous ceramics",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.149,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.149
Enhancement of antimicrobial and long-term biostability of the zinc-incorporated hydroxyapatite coated 316L stainless steel implant for biomedical application,"Antimicrobial hydroxyapatite (HAp) nanoparticles with different concentrations (0, 3, and 6mol%) of zinc were prepared by the ultrasonication process. The prepared nanoparticles and chitosan (CTS) composite were coated on 316L stainless steel implant by spin coating technique. The powder samples were characterised by particle size analyser, X-ray fluorescence, and X-ray diffraction studies. The morphology of the coating was investigated by scanning electron microscopy. The diameter of the particle size decreased with increase in the concentration of zinc in HAp structure. The structure of the coated implant was found to be uniform without any cracks and pores. Antimicrobial activity of the composites against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia, Salmonella typhi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was analysed. The results showed that the increase in the concentration of zinc enhances the antimicrobial properties of 316L stainless steel implant. The stability of the implant in physiological environment was characterised by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and polarisation analysis. The higher concentration of the ZnHAp/CTS composite shows higher corrosion resistance than that of the HAp/CTS-coated implant. This study shows that the coating provides corrosion resistance to the stainless steel substrate in simulated body fluid (SBF). The in vitro bioactivity study of the coated samples immersed in SBF solution confirms the formation of bone-like apatite layer on the surface of the implant. Thus, highly biocompatible ZnHAp/CTS-coated materials could be very useful in the long-term stability of the biomedical applications.","Sutha, S.;Karunakaran, G.;Rajendran, V.",2013-07-31,Ceramics International,"B.

Schottky barrier effect of ZnO modified methyl glycol thin films for detection of hydrogen sulfide gas,Highly nanocrystalline ZnO modified methyl glycol thin films have been deposited on a p-type silicon substrate via the sol–gel spin coating manner. The morphology of the as-deposited film was scrutinized using scanning electron microscopy. I–V characteristics of the as-prepared ZnO film under vacuum and in open air were monitored. The results showed that the ZnO films have a barrier height of 0.38eV under vacuum and 0.62eV in open air. The Schottky barrier height between ZnO grains was determined for different reducing gases. The ZnO film showed high sensitivity to H2S gas compared with other reducing gases due to the reduction of barrier height between ZnO grains. The as-prepared ZnO film was annealed at four different temperatures. X-ray diffraction manifested that the wurtzite hexagonal structure of ZnO deviated from ideality at annealing temperature greater than 650°C. The barrier height of ZnO film decreased due to the increase of annealing temperature up to 650°C and then decreased. The results also confirmed that the change of barrier height strongly affected the sensitivity of ZnO film.,"Al-Ghamdi, S.A.;Al-Heniti, S.H.;Mahmoud, Waleed E.",2013-07-31,Ceramics International,"Spin coating,Annealing,Schottky barrier,Gas sensitivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.11.100,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.11.100
In situ growth of boron doped g-C3N4 on carbon fiber cloth as a recycled flexible film-photocatalyst,"The development of feasible, highly stable and easily recycled metal-free photocatalysts has drawn great attention for wastewater purification. Herein, dip-coating followed with thermal polymerization is developed for in situ growth of boron doped graphitic carbon nitride (BCN) on carbon fiber cloth (CFc) as flexible film photocatalysts. HNO3 treatment on CFc is used to improve the surface hydrophilicity of CF, which is beneficial for the adsorption and nucleation of BCN precursor on CFc in aqueous solution. Boric acid not only works as the boron source but also causes a porous morphology of BCN due to the gasification of water generated from boric acid decomposition during heating process. Because of the close contact between CFc and BCN, CFc induces BCN to better crystalize. Furthermore, the film-photocatalyst exhibits high mechanical stability and recyclability. The porous sheet-like structures, together with the boron doping and CFc support, can improve light capture, charge separation and transport, and dye adsorption. Our work provides a thinking for component and morphology regulation of film-based flexible catalysts towards reusable photocatalysis under outdoor sunlight.","Lei, Lin;Wang, Weijia;Wang, Chao;Zhang, Mingchang;Zhong, Qi;Fan, Huiqing",2020-08-31,Ceramics International,"Photocatalysis,Graphitic carbon nitride,Carbon fiber cloth,Doping,Recycled flexible film",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.246,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.246
Functionalized tricalcium phosphate and poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate) derived composite scaffolds as platforms for the controlled release of diclofenac,"Novel bone substitutes such as highly porous ceramic scaffolds can serve as platforms for delivering active molecules. A common problem is to control the release of the drug, therefore, it is beneficial to use a drug-functionalized polymer coating. In this study, β-tricalcium phosphate-based porous scaffolds were obtained and coated with diclofenac-functionalized biopolymer – poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate) – P(3HO). To the best of our knowledge, studies using P(3HO) as a component in ceramic-polymer based drug delivery system for bone tissue regeneration have not yet been reported. Presented materials were comprehensively investigated by various techniques such as powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy, hydrostatic weighing and compression tests, pH and ionic conductivity measurements, high-performance liquid chromatography and in vitro cytotoxicity studies. The obtained diclofenac-loaded composite was not only characterised by controlled and sustained drug release, but also possessed improved mechanical properties. Moreover, the precipitation of apatite-like forms on its surface was observed after incubation in simulated body fluid, which indicates its bioactive potential. After 24 hours no cytotoxic effect on MC3T3-E1 mouse preosteoblastic cells was confirmed using indirect cytotoxicity studies. Thus, this promising multifunctional composite scaffold can be a promising candidate as an anti-inflammatory drug-delivery system in bone tissue engineering.","Skibiński, Szymon;Cichoń, Ewelina;Haraźna, Katarzyna;Marcello, Elena;Roy, Ipsita;Witko, Małgorzata;Ślósarczyk, Anna;Czechowska, Joanna;Guzik, Maciej;Zima, Aneta",2020-09-28,Ceramics International,"Tricalcium phosphates,Polyhydroxyalkanoates,Diclofenac,Drug delivery,Scaffolds,Bone tissue engineering",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.248,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.248
Correlation of microstructure and mechanical properties of various fabric reinforced geo-polymer composites after exposure to elevated temperature,"This article presents the correlation between microstructure and mechanical properties such as flexural strength, flexural modulus of fabric reinforced geo-polymer composite after their exposure to elevated temperature (up to 1000°C). Geo-polymer matrices with Si:Al ratio of 15.6 were synthesized and the samples of geo-polymer composite were fabricated with three different types of fabric reinforcements such as carbon, E-glass and basalt fibers. The residual strength of carbon based geo-polymer composite increased with increase of the processing temperature after 600°C. The basalt reinforced geo-polymer composite strength decreased at higher processing temperature, which may be due to the strong interaction between matrix and fiber and transformation of the composite into a ceramic-like structure. The non-adhesion of E-glass fiber to geo-polymer matrix and pyrolysis of the fiber at high temperature has been observed in the composite. Carbon reinforced geo-polymer composite can be possible candidate for the high temperature applications in thermal barrier coatings and panels.","Samal, Sneha;Phan Thanh, Nhan;Petríková, Iva;Marvalová, Bohdana;Vallons, Katleen A.M.;Lomov, Stepan V.",2015-11-30,Ceramics International,"C.

The effect of microstructure on corrosion behavior of a novel AlCrTiSiN ceramic coating,"A novel AlCrTiSiN ceramic coating was deposited on 316L austenitic stainless steel (ASS) to enhance its anti-corrosion against 10 vol% HCl solution. Meanwhile, an AlCrN coating was selected for comparison. The results show the AlCrTiSiN consists entirely of single-phase fcc-AlCrTiSiN solid solution, showing nano-multilayered structure. While the AlCrN coating is composed of single-phase fcc-AlCrN solid solution, revealing a typical columnar structure. Growth-related micro-particles (MPs) induce the transformation of growth behavior of the AlCrTiSiN coating over MPs from nano-layered structure to columnar structure, resulting in a reduction in coating densification. Corrosion mechanisms of AlCrTiSiN-coated sample are: pitting corrosion first arrives from surface defects and columnar GBs, and then propagate towards coating subsurface until steel substrate, leading to local corrosion. Subsequently, the galvanic corrosion between coating and substrate happens, resulting in the rapid dissolution of steel substrate beneath the coatings. The combination of pitting corrosion, local corrosion and galvanic corrosion further induces the corrosion cracking, and finally results in coating delamination. In addition, layered interfaces induce the deflection of corrosion cracks along layered interfaces, and further retard the dissolution of coating. Electrochemical and immersion tests confirm that the AlCrTiSiN-coated sample shows a superior corrosion resistance compared with AlCrN-coated one. Superior anti-corrosion of AlCrTiSiN ceramic coating is mainly related to its lower MP number density, denser structure and high-density layered interfaces parallel to coating surface.","Chen, Wanglin;Hu, Te;Wang, Chengyong;Xiao, Hui;Meng, Xianna",2020-06-01,Ceramics International,"316L ASS,AlCrTiSiN ceramic coating,Single-phase solid solution,AlCrN,Microstructure,HCl solution",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.022
"Effects of Ni content on microstructure, mechanical properties and Inconel 718 cutting performance of AlTiN-Ni nanocomposite coatings","AlTiN-Ni coatings with various Ni contents (0–3 at%) were deposited using cathodic arc evaporation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, a nanohardness tester, scratch-adhesion tester, and cutting tester were used to examine the microstructure, mechanical properties, and cutting performance of the coatings. The AlTiN coatings exhibited a columnar structure, while the AlTiN-Ni coatings exhibited a nanocrystal structure due to the formation of nc-AlTiN/Ni nanocomposite coatings. The nanohardness of the AlTiN-Ni coatings decreased from 26.2 GPa to 20.9 GPa as the Ni content increased from 0 to 3 at%. At an Ni content of 1.5 at%, the coating possessed a high toughness and sufficient adhesion strength; however, these dropped drastically for the AlTiN-Ni coating with 3 at% Ni owing to the presence of amorphous Ni. The results for the Inconel 718 turning indicated that the wear mode is adhesion at the rake face, abrasion and adhesion (built-up edge) at the flank face, and chipping at the cutting edge. Compared to AlTiN-Ni3 and AlTiN-coated tools, the lifetime of the AlTiN-Ni1.5 coated tool increased to 160% at a cutting speed of 40 m/min. This was attributed to less adhesion at the rake face and chipping at the cutting edge, due to the nanocrystal structure and higher toughness of the AlTiN-Ni1.5 coating.","Yi, Jiyong;Chen, Songyi;Chen, Kanghua;Xu, Yinchao;Chen, Qiang;Zhu, Changjun;Liu, Li",2019-01-31,Ceramics International,"AlTiN-Ni nanocomposite coatings,Microstructure,Mechanical properties,Cutting performance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.192,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.192
Microscale investigation of fiber-matrix interface properties of strain-hardening geopolymer composite,"This study reports the microscale investigation of a short fiber-reinforced fly ash-based strain-hardening geopolymer composite (SHGC), which possesses high tensile strength (4.7MPa) and very high tensile strain capacity (4.3%). The investigation involved determination of the quantitative influences of the type of activator, water to geopolymer solids ratio and fiber surface oil coating on the microscale fiber-matrix interface properties using single-fiber pullout tests. The effects of the measured interface properties on the crack bridging σ(δ) relation of the composites were investigated using a micromechanics-based model to explain the experimentally observed macroscopic tensile ductility of the composites. The computed σ(δ) relation of fly ash-based SHGCs satisfied the necessary micromechanics-based conditions of steady-state flat crack propagation, which result in strain-hardening behavior. This research provides an in-depth understanding of fundamental fiber-matrix interaction properties and mechanisms, and their consequent effects on crack-bridging and tensile performance of the developed fly ash-based SHGCs. This understanding presents the rational basis for design of such cement-less composites.","Nematollahi, Behzad;Qiu, Jishen;Yang, En-Hua;Sanjayan, Jay",2017-12-01,Ceramics International,"Strain hardening geopolymer composite (SHGC),Geopolymer,Fly ash,Type of activator,Fiber-matrix interface,Micromechanics",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.118,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.118
Preparation and characterization of graded SSC–SDC MIEC cathode for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,"Mixed ionic/electronic conductor (MIEC) cathodes with graded composition and microstructures have been fabricated using improved spin-coating technique. Two components, Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) and Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 (SSC), were utilized to prepare the graded MIEC cathode. Graded microstructures, i.e., a SSC-rich outer layer with large interconnected pores and a SDC-rich inner layer with small interconnected pores, were observed. The corresponding single cell had an increase of 13.3% in maximum power density at operating temperature of 600°C.

Preparation and characterization of nano SiO2@CeO2 extracted from blast furnace slag and uranium extraction waste for wastewater treatment,"Nowadays, ceramic oxides such as SiO2, CeO2 and their hybrid SiO2@CeO2 are considered as interesting materials for many applications. In the present work, SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) were extracted from blast furnace slag (waste material derived from iron industry) by chemical method. On the other hand, CeO2 NPs were also extracted from radioactive nitrate solution waste using tris(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate solvent (TEHP). A simple precipitation and calcination method was used to prepare silica functionalized by ceria i.e. SiO2@CeO2 core-shell nanoparticles. In order to examine phase composition, structural characteristics, morphological, surface area and physical properties, the prepared NPs were characterized by various techniques. These techniques were XRF, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms, DLS, TEM, and Zeta potential. The activity of prepared SiO2 and hybrid SiO2@CeO2 materials towards the adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue dye (MB) was investigated in absence (dark) or presence of UV–visible light. The results revealed that CeO2, SiO2 and SiO2@CeO2 nanoparticles having high surface area, high pore volume and small particle sizes were successfully prepared using the aforementioned waste materials. SiO2 NPs exhibited higher absorption capacity for MB in dark due to its higher negative surface charge as indicated by its zeta potential result. On the other hand, enhanced photocatalytic activity was obtained after coating CeO2 on SiO2 nanoparticles as compared with that of single SiO2. The overall adsorption efficiencies for MB in dark followed by UV light using SiO2 and SiO2@CeO2 were 94% and 99.1%, respectively. The kinetic studies indicated that the reaction proceeded as a pseudo-second order reaction.","Dhmees, Abdelghaffar.S.;Rashad, Ahmed M.;Eliwa, Ahmed A.;Zawrah, M.F.",2019-04-15,Ceramics International,"SiO2@CeO2,Blast furnace slag,Radioactive waste,Photocatalytic activity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.014
Fabrication of Al2O3/AlN composite ceramics with enhanced performance via a heterogeneous precipitation coating process,"To improve the thermal and mechanical properties of Al2O3/AlN composite ceramics, a novel heterogeneous precipitation coating (HPC) approach was introduced into the fabrication of Al2O3/AlN ceramics. For this approach, Al2O3 and AlN powders were coated with a layer of amorphous Y2O3, with the coated Al2O3 and AlN powders found to favor the formation of an interconnected YAG second phase along the grain boundaries. The interconnected YAG phase was designed to act as a diffusion barrier layer to minimize the detrimental interdiffusion between Al2O3 and AlN particles. Compared with samples prepared by a conventional ball-milling method, the HPC Al2O3/AlN composites exhibited less AlON formation, a higher relative density, a smaller grain size and a more homogeneous microstructure. The thermal conductivity, bending strength, fracture toughness and Weibull modulus of the HPC Al2O3/AlN composite ceramics were found to reach 34.21 ± 0.34 W m−1 K−1, 475.61 ± 21.56 MPa, 5.53 ± 0.29 MPa m1/2 and 25.61, respectively, which are much higher than those for the Al2O3 and Al2O3/AlN samples prepared by the conventional ball-milling method. These results suggest that HPC is a more effective technique for preparing Al2O3/AlN composites with enhanced thermal and mechanical properties, and is probably applicable to other composite material systems as well.","Nie, Guanglin;Li, Yehua;Sheng, Pengfei;Tian, Zhuo;Liu, Wei;Wu, Haidong;Bao, Yiwang;Wu, Shanghua",2020-09-30,Ceramics International,"B.

Performance evaluation of plasma sprayed yttria coatings on high density graphite for cathode processor applications,"Cathode processing in the pyrochemical reprocessing of spent metallic nuclear fuels encompasses melting and consolidation of uranium deposit obtained from the electro-refining step. Ceramic coated High density graphite (HDG) is considered for process crucibles in the cathode process. Thermal cycling behaviour of plasma sprayed yttria coated HDG discs with NiCrAlY bond coat was investigated at 1000 and 1100°C in vacuum. Each thermal cycle comprised soaking for 1h at the isothermal temperature followed by furnace cooling to ambient temperature. The microstructure and elemental composition of the as-received and thermal cycled yttria coated samples were analysed by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy. Phase identification of the coating, performed by X-ray diffraction and laser Raman spectroscopic techniques confirmed the presence of only cubic phase in the as-received as well as thermal cycled samples. Yttria coating failed after 35 thermal cycles at 1000°C and 19 cycles at 1100°C. Micro-cracks developed after three uranium melting experiments at 1300°C could be owing to phase change in the bond coat.","Rao, Ch. Jagadeeswara;Shankar, A. Ravi;Mallika, C.;Mudali, U.

Self-propagating high-temperature synthesis of advanced ceramics in the Mo–Si–B system: Kinetics and mechanism of combustion and structure formation,"The goal of this work is to investigate the combustion mechanisms of reactions in the Mo–Si–B system and to obtain ceramic materials using the SHS method. It is concluded that the following processes are defined by the SHS for Si-rich Mo–Si–B compositions: silicon melting, its spreading over the surfaces of the solid Mo and B particles, followed by B dissolution in the melt, and formation of intermediate Mo3Si-phase film. The subsequent diffusion of silicon into molybdenum results in the formation of MoSi2 grains and molybdenum boride phase forms due to the diffusion of molybdenum into B-rich melt. The formation of MoB phase for B-rich compositions may occur via gas-phase mass transfer of MoO3 gaseous species to boron particles. The stages of chemical interaction in the combustion wave are also investigated. The obtained results indicate the possibility of both parallel and consecutive reactions to form molybdenum silicide and molybdenum boride phases. Thus the progression of combustion process may occur through the merging reaction fronts regime and splitting reaction fronts regime. Molybdenum silicide formation leads the combustion wave propagation during the splitting regime, while the molybdenum boride phase appears later. Finally, targets for magnetron sputtering of promising multi-phase Mo–Si–B coatings are synthesised by forced SHS compaction method.","Levashov, E.A.;Pogozhev, Yu.S.;Potanin, A.Yu.;Kochetov, N.A.;Kovalev, D.Yu.;Shvyndina, N.V.;Sviridova, T.A.",2014-06-30,Ceramics International,"Self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS),Reaction diffusion,MoB,MoSi2",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.11.107,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.11.107
Applicability of DLC and WC/C low friction coatings on Al2O3/TiCN mixed ceramic cutting tools for dry machining of hardened 52100 steel,"The present work examines the applicability of DLC and WC/C low friction coatings on Al2O3/TiCN based mixed ceramic cutting tools for the dry and hard turning of AISI 52100 steel (62 HRC). The characterization of coated tools reveals that the coatings retain very low values of surface roughness, whereas the DLC coating exhibits much higher microhardness when compared to the WC/C coating. On the other hand, the WC/C coating exhibit a coarse surface morphology virtually due to the tungsten doping. Later, continuous turning tests were executed with the help of coated and uncoated cutting tools under dry cutting conditions, and their performance was investigated in terms of machining forces, cutting temperature and tool wear. Coating delamination by flaking and peeling is quite prominent in the case of both the coatings; however, it is less severe for the WC/C coated tool. The coatings help to reduce machining forces, cutting temperatures and tool wear, but the performance of coated tools converge towards uncoated tool as the cutting speed, and feed rate is increased. Both the coatings prevent the development of cracks near the cutting edge with WC/C coating exhibiting superior wear behavior basically due to its multilayered structure and better thermal stability. Moreover, the tested low friction coatings don't serve as thermal barriers and only the lubrication generated due to graphitization at the chip-tool interface is mostly responsible for the improved machining performance.","Sateesh Kumar, Ch;Majumder, Himadri;Khan, Akhtar;Patel, Saroj Kumar",2020-06-01,Ceramics International,"DLC coating,Low friction coating,WC/C coating,Hard turning,Mixed ceramic cutting tool",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.225,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.225
Improving the stability and bioactivity of micro-arc oxidized calcium phosphate/titania porous coatings by high energy shot peening pretreatment,"Micro-arc oxidation (MAO) is one of the conventional methods for surface modification of titanium (Ti)-based dental materials. However, in the process of MAO, the surface porous titania (TiO2) coating is prone to micro-crack, which affects the stability of coating and the long-term service life of the implant. In this work, high-energy shot peening (HESP) pretreatment would be used to improve the stability and bioactivity of the MAO coatings and increase the effective doping of calcium and phosphorus (Ca & P) elements in surfaces. We verified that the MAO specimens pretreated by HESP (S-MAO) had larger pore size (~ 4.0 μm), coating thickness (~ 8.5 μm) and critical load (~ 11.1 N) than the samples without pretreatment (MAO, ~ 3.1 μm, 6.2 μm & 6.2 N); and the content of Ca and P in S-MAO group (Ca: ~ 6.3 wt%; P: ~ 9.4 wt%) was higher than that of MAO group (Ca: ~ 5.8 wt%; P: ~ 6.7 wt%. Meanwhile, it was also proved that compared with Ti and MAO groups, MC3T3-E1 cells on S-MAO substrates had better spreading, viability, ALP activity, and osteogenic gene expression. All the above results indicate that the HESP pretreatment has excellent potential to improve the coating stability and bioactivity of MAO-treated substrates.","Shen, Xinkun;Ping, Linchao;Wang, Lili;Liu, Chongxing;Liu, Jinsong;Deng, Zhennan",2020-02-01,Ceramics International,"Titanium,Micro-arc oxidation,High-energy shot peening,Coating stability,Bioactivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.183,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.183
Preparation and optimization of ZrO2 modified P2-type Na2/3Ni1/6Co1/6Mn2/3O2 with enhanced electrochemical performance as cathode for sodium ion batteries,"Surface stabilization is necessary for cathode materials to gain a long-term cycling stability because of unfavorable side reactions and exfoliation caused by corrosive environment. To improve the cyclic stability of P2-type ternary cathode Na2/3Ni1/6Co1/6Mn2/3O2 for sodium ion batteries, we prepare a ZrO2-coated Na2/3Ni1/6Co1/6Mn2/3O2 through a simple wet chemical method. The coating layer is distributed homogeneously on the surface, and the fraction of ZrO2 (1 wt-%, 2 wt-%, 3 wt-%, 4 wt-%, 5 wt-%) helps control the thickness of the coating layer. It turns out that all the materials exhibit pure P2 structure without any impurities. The material with a 2 wt-% ZrO2 coating exhibits the best electrochemical performance in rate capability and long-term cyclic stability. It delivers a superior initial discharge capacity of 140 mA h·g−1 between 2 and 4.5 V at 20 mA g−1. Even cycles at high current density (100 mA g−1), it shows 106 mA h·g−1 reversible discharge capacity with 88% capacity retention after 300 cycles. The improvement in electrochemical performance is attributed to the segregation of cathode materials from the corrosive electrolyte by the nano-sized ZrO2 layer. The EIS results confirm that a thin ZrO2 coating layer can effectively protect the electrode from dissolution and stabilize the SEI film. This study can be used to develop the electrochemical performance of cathode materials for sodium ion batteries by surface modification via ZrO2.","Bao, Shuo;Luo, Shao-Hua;Lu, Jin-Lin",2020-07-31,Ceramics International,"Sodium ion batteries,ZrO2-Coating,Cycling stability,P2 structure,Spherical Na2/3Ni1/6Co1/6Mn2/3O2",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.160,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.160
Fabrication of superhydrophilic membrane filters using spherical glass particles obtained by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis,"Fabrication of high performance membrane filters requires that both the substrate and the filtering layer have low resistance to liquid flow. The thickness, uniform porosity and hydrophilic nature are the main responsible parameters. Due to the antimicrobial property of the material it is widely used in solid/liquid separation. In this study, the substrate was of quartz type and the additives (frit glass and zeolite) made the filters with glassy pore walls as the sintering temperature applied was above their fusion temperature. The coating layer produced by antimicrobial and superhydrophilic (contact angel 8°) borosilicate glass particles has spherical shapes and their size intervals are narrow (0.65–2.4μm). A thin layer coating without any cracks on the surface pores of the substrate has been obtained successfully.

In-field reparation of the damaged coatings for C/C composites,"Protective coatings are critical to the successful application of the carbon/carbon (C/C) composites in the thermal protection systems of space vehicles. The damages of such coatings during installation and operation would threaten the safety of flight. In this contribution, an in-field technology based on a multilayer structure was developed to repair the damaged coatings of C/C composites. The multilayer structure contains a silicon buffer inner layer, a mullite heat-resistant middle layer and a borosilicate glass outer layer. The oxidation tests in air at 1300°C and 1500°C indicated that the weight loss of the repaired samples was greatly reduced compared with that of the damaged ones. The plasma wind tunnel tests for both repaired and damaged coatings further demonstrated that the multilayer structure could effectively protect the damaged composites from ablation in oxidation environments.","Wang, Kewei;Luo, Lei;Lu, Yonghong;Yang, Juan;Wang, Yiguang",2015-07-31,Ceramics International,"Coating repair,Multi-layer coating,Oxidation test",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.02.078,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.02.078
Preparation and thermal reflectivity of nickel antimony titanium yellow rutile coated hollow glass microspheres composite pigment,"In order to reduce the urban heat island effect, nonwhite lightweight pigments with high near infrared reflectance were studied. Nickel Antimony Titanium Yellow Rutile pigments (TiNiY) coated hollow glass microspheres (HGM@TiNiY) with core-shell structure were prepared by a novel mixing slurry-sintering method. The Reflective property of HGM@TiNiY/SR composite coating prepared by mixing HGM@TiNiY with silicone resin (SR) was investigated by an UV–Vis–NIR spectrum analyzer. The results showed that the size distribution of TiNiY particles was from 150 to 450 nm with an average size of 230 nm, and the binding mode of TiNiY particles with HGM and the formation mechanism of TiNiY Shell were discussed. The UV–Vis–NIR reflectance of HGM@TiNiY/SR coating was not only better than that of others filled with HGM powders or TiNiY powders alone but also higher than that of the coating filled with the mixture of HGM and TiNiY powders at the same volume ratio. A possible mechanism of HGM@TiNiY/SR coating on thermal reflection was discussed. This clearly indicates that the pigment of HGM@TiNiY with core-shell structure could be applied as a good colour cool pigment.","Zeng, Guoxun;Yang, Jiankun;Hong, Renpeng;Li, Zhenghui;Chen, Yuanwu;Li, Feng;Wu, Qibai;Liu, Liying;Jiang, Xiangyang",2018-06-01,Ceramics International,"Core-shell structure,Nickel Antimony Titanium Yellow Rutile,Hollow glass microspheres,Heat reflectance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.025
Porous titania microspheres with uniform wall thickness and high photoactivity,"Highly porous titania particles were prepared by depositing thin films of titania, using alternating reactions of TiCl4 and hydrogen peroxide, on poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) (PS-DVB) template particles via atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 77°C. The composition of the titania films was verified by XPS analysis and the titania films were directly observed by TEM. TGA/DSC was used to study the thermal decomposition of the polymer template. Porous titania particles with uniform wall thicknesses were successfully obtained after the template PS-DVB was removed by oxidation in air at 400°C for 24h. Verification of the resulting porous structure of the titania particles was done by cross-sectional SEM and nitrogen adsorption–desorption analysis. Porous titania particles were treated at different temperatures. XRD analysis was used to determine the microstructure and phase transformation of titania at elevated temperatures. The photocatalytic activity of these porous titania particles was studied by methylene blue decomposition under UV light at room temperature and was found to be comparable to that of commercial anatase titania nanoparticles (~20nm). Depositing Na2SO4 on TiO2 retarded the TiO2 phase transformation from anatase to rutile during calcination and, thus, greatly increased the photoactivity of the porous titania particles.","Liang, Xinhua;Patel, Rajankumar L.",2014-03-31,Ceramics International,"Atomic layer deposition (ALD),Coating,Titania,Porous,Photoactivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.10.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.10.001
Ferroelectric BaTiO3@ZnO heterostructure nanofibers with enhanced pyroelectrically-driven-catalysis,"In this work, an obvious enhancement of pyroelectrically-driven catalytic activity is found in BaTiO3@ZnO heterostructures synthesized hydrothermally and then calcined. The pure BaTiO3 is able to decompose up to 45% of the RhB dye in aqueous solution (5 mg/L) under 30–54 °C cold-hot cycle. As the ZnO content coating on the surface of the BaTiO3 nanofibers is increased from 0 to 5 wt%, the decomposition ratio of the BaTiO3@ZnO heterostructures for RhB dye in aqueous solution first increases and then decreases, giving a maximum value of 97% at 2.5 wt%. The kinetic rate constant (K = 0.06384 cycle−1) of the catalytic reaction for BaTiO3 @2.5%ZnO is 4 times higher than that of pure BaTiO3. The enhancement of catalytic activity of BaTiO3@ZnO may be due to the formation of a semiconductor junction in which the electric field effectively separating the pyro-induced electron-hole pairs and further accelerates carrier migration. The ferroelectric heterostructures of BaTiO3@ZnO show pyroelectrically-driven-catalysis and may hold potential for use in decomposing dye wastewater through harvesting cold-hot alternation thermal-energy.","Wang, Lang;Haugen, Neale O.;Wu, Zheng;Shu, Xiaoxin;Jia, Yanmin;Ma, Jiangping;Yu, Shigang;Li, Huamei;Chai, Qunxia",2019-01-31,Ceramics International,"Ferroelectric materials,BaTiO3 nanofibers,Pyroelectrically-driven-catalysis,BaTiO3@ZnO heterostructures",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.137,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.137
"Growth of silver nanoparticles within the tellurovanadate amorphous matrix: Optical band gap and band tailing properties, beside the Williamson-Hall estimation of crystallite size and lattice strain","The present paper aims at growth of silver nanoparticles in the tellurovanadate glassy matrix, structural verification including determination of the size of nano-crystals and lattice strain using Williamson-Hall approach, evaluation of energy band gap and the width of the localized states (Urbach energy) and comparison of the obtained results with the previously reported data for corresponding glasses. So, the bulk and blown-layer glass-systems of xAg2O-40TeO2-(60-x)V2O5 compositions with different molar concentrations (0 ≤ x ≤ 50), were converted to glass-ceramics using heat treatment. To investigate the optical properties, optical absorption spectra of layer samples were recorded within the wavelength range of 190–1100 nm. So, the energy band gap and the width of the localized states (Urbach energy) were determined using the high precision derivation of absorption spectrum fitting (DASF) method, and the obtained results show the major increase compared with those corresponding glasses, implying on the formation of nano-crystals in glassy matrix (glass-ceramics). The Williamson-Hall method was used to determine the size of nano-crystals and lattice strain. Among the samples, sample with x = 40 has the lowest lattice strain (with high elastic moduli, promising it as coating materials) and sample with x = 30 has the lowest size in nano-phase. It was found that, in spite the outputs of Scherrer̛s formula, the results of the crystallite size measured by Williamson-Hall method were in good agreement with FESEM results; such results confirm the validity of Williamson-Hall approach for X-ray peak variance analysis.","Shahmoradi, Yazdan;Souri, Dariush",2019-04-15,Ceramics International,"Glass-ceramics,Energy band gap,Williamson-Hall approach,Urbach energy,DASF method",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.094,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.094

Deposition of adherent hard coatings on steel by plasma-enhanced CVD,"Wear resistant TiN x - and TiC x N y -layers were deposited on various pretreated steel substrates in the temperature range 673–773 K. The influence of the process parameters and substrate pretreatment on the deposition rate, layer composition, interface and layer structure, microhardness and stress have been investigated. With optimized process parameters, layers with a low oxygen and chlorine impurity content, high microhardness and a good adhesive strength are obtained. Usually, the TiN x - and also the TiC x N y -layers with low carbon content deposited at 773 K have a columnar structure with a 〈200〉 texture. Nevertheless for TiC x a 〈111〉 texture is observed. TiN x -layers prepared below 773 K have a 〈111〉 preferred orientation or they are textureless. The adhesion of the coatings on plasma nitrided steel substrates is remarkably higher than on non-nitrided substrates.

"Calcium-magnesium-alumina-silicate (CMAS) resistance property of BaLn2Ti3O10 (Ln=La, Nd) for thermal barrier coating applications","Calcium-magnesium-alumina-silicate (CMAS) has posed enormous threat to thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). In this study, a series of newly developed TBC ceramics, BaLn2Ti3O10 (Ln=La, Nd), are found to have high resistance to the penetration of molten CMAS at 1250°C. The formation of a continuous, dense crystalline layer, mainly composed of apatite and CaTiO3 phases, on the sample surfaces contributed to this desirable attribute. The accumulation of Ba in the molten CMAS triggered the crystallization of the melt, leading to the formation of many BaAl2Si2O8 celsian crystals above the crystalline layer, which could reduce the mobility of the molten CMAS. The mechanisms by which the CMAS attacks BaLn2Ti3O10 samples are discussed. The results indicate that Ba is an effective element for altering CMAS composition, and doping Ba in TBCs might be an attractive way of mitigating CMAS attack.","Guo, Lei;Li, Mingzhu;Yang, Chenxi;Zhang, Chenglong;Xu, Luming;Ye, Fuxing;Dan, Chengyi;Ji, Vincent",2017-09-30,Ceramics International,"BaLn2Ti3O10,Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs),Calcium-magnesium-alumina-silicate (CMAS),Crystallization",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.107,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.107
Synthesis and characterization of sulfur-doped carbon decorated LiFePO4 nanocomposite as high performance cathode material for lithium-ion batteries,"This is the first report where crystalline sulfur-doped carbon decorated LiFePO4 nanocomposite are employed as cathode material for lithium-ion batteries. The electrode has been synthesized via a sol–gel route, in which benzyl disulfide and oxalic acid are used as the sulfur and carbon source, respectively. Meanwhile, the as-synthesized sample is characterized by XRD, SEM, EDS mapping, TEM, Raman spectra, XPS and electrochemical techniques. The results reveal that the sulfur-doped carbon is uniformly coated on the surface of LiFePO4 without destroying the crystal structure of the bulk material. Moreover, both the electronic conductivity and defect level of the carbon clearly increase, as a consequence, the electron and Li-ion diffusion of the electrode is further improved. As a cathode material for lithium-ion batteries, it exhibits a more outstanding electrochemical performance, especially the rate capability and long cyclic performance. Thus, it can be drawn a conclusion that the sulfur-doped carbon coating approach is an effective method to improve the electrochemical performance of LiFePO4 and could be extended to modify other electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries.","Xu, Dong;Wang, Peifeng;Shen, Biwen",2016-03-31,Ceramics International,"Lithium-ion batteries,LiFePO4,Cathode material,Sulfur-doped carbon",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.12.064,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.12.064
Effect of material properties on residual stress distribution in thermal barrier coatings,"Residual stress has a significant influence on the crack nucleation and propagation in thermal barrier coatings (TBC) system. In this work, the residual stress in the air plasma spraying (APS) TBC system during cooling process was numerically studied, and the influence of the material properties of each layer on the residual stress was investigated. The morphologies of the interface were described by a piecewise cosine function, and the amplitude for each segment gradually increases. The elasticity, plasticity and creep of top coat (TC), thermally grown oxide (TGO) layer and bond coat (BC) were considered and the elasticity and creep of the substrate layer were taken into account. The material properties of all layers vary with temperature. The results show that the material properties have complex influence on the residual stress during cooling. The effect of the material properties of TC and BC on the residual stress at the interface is relatively large, and that of TGO and substrate is relatively small. These results provide important insight into the failure mechanism of air plasma spraying thermal barrier coatings, and important guidance for the optimization of thermal barrier coating interfaces.","Yu, Q.M.;He, Q.",2018-02-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,Residual stress,Finite element method,Material property",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.127,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.127
Preparation and properties of microfiltration membranes based on natural crystalline SiO2,"The method of obtaining ceramic microfiltration membranes in the form of tubes based on natural crystalline silicon dioxide (quartz sand) of Saudi Arabia was developed and the samples were compared to ones obtained using quartz sand of the Republic of Belarus. The substrates were fabricated by the isostatic pressing method. Microfiltration membrane layers were applied using slurry of finely dispersed crystal silicon dioxide in aqueous solution of aluminosilicate binder. The microfiltration membranes are defectless and uniform and are characterized by average pore size of 5–10µm and water permeability of 25–45m3/(h×m2×bar).

Structure evolution and ablation behavior of ZrC coating on C/C composites under single and cyclic oxyacetylene torch environment,"ZrC ablation resistance coating was prepared on carbon/carbon composites by low pressure chemical vapor deposition using the ZrCl4–C3H6–H2–Ar system. The structure evolution and ablation behavior of the coating under single and cyclic ablation were investigated in an oxyacetylene torch environment. Single ablation results show that the ablated coating consists of three layers (outer ZrO2 layer, transitional ZrC x O y layer and residual ZrC layer). An oxidation progress is inferred that ZrC is oxidized into ZrC x O y firstly and then into ZrO2 in the case of the continuous diffusion of oxygen. Cyclic ablation results show that the effect of crack growth inhibition and the oxygen diffusion limitation of ZrO2 and ZrC x O y layers dominate the ablation of the coating and result in two different ablation behaviors. Based on the role of the ZrO2 and ZrC x O y layers in the single and cyclic ablation, two different ablation modes of the coating are proposed.","Wang, Shao-Long;Li, Ke-zhi;Li, He-Jun;Zhang, Yu-Lei;Feng, Tao",2014-12-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Bi-doped lanthanum molybdate: Enhancing the anharmonicity and reducing the thermal conductivity using Bi3+ with lone pair electrons,"La2Mo2O9 has a considerably low thermal conductivity (0.95 W m−1 K−1) at 1273 K, making it an attractive material for thermal barrier coatings. To further reduce the thermal conductivity of La2Mo2O9, we focused on the anharmonicity of the lattice induced by lone pair electrons. We substituted the La3+ site of La2Mo2O9 by Bi3+, which has lone pair electrons, and studied the effect of bismuth doping on the anharmonicity and thermal conductivity of La2Mo2O9. Bismuth doping enhanced the Grüneisen parameter, which is an indicator of anharmonicity, and reduced the thermal conductivity by 24% with respect to non-doped La2Mo2O9 at 300 K by substituting with 6 mol% Bi. Theoretical predictions based on the Klemens-Callaway model with experimentally obtained Grüneisen parameters were performed to analyze the thermal conductivity; the reduction in thermal conductivity is mainly attributed to the enhanced anharmonicity provided by Bi substitution.","Ok, Kyung Min;Ohishi, Yuji;Mitazono, Yusuke;Muta, Hiroaki;Kurosaki, Ken;Yamanaka, Shinsuke",2018-09-30,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Crystalline oxides,Anharmonicity,Thermal conductivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.262,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.262
"Effect of boron concentration on the mechanical, tribological and corrosion properties of Ta–B–N films by reactive magnetron sputtering","A practical design approach in improving the mechanical and corrosion characteristics of nitride-based films is by the synthesis of nanocomposites, and we have fabricated tantalum boron nitride (Ta–B–N) nanocomposite films by a reactive magnetron sputtering process. The deposited Ta–B–N coatings were found to exhibit a nanocomposite structure consisting of nanocrystalline TaN and amorphous BN phase coexisting. The incorporation of boron into the films modified the microstructure from columnar to fine grain with a face-centred cubic (fcc) TaN (200) preferred orientation. However, the hardness increased to a maximum value of ∼33.3 GPa when the boron concentration was 1.5 at.%. The increase in hardness was due to both grain refinement and the increase in compressive residual stress. More so, the wear rate of the film initially improved upon the addition of boron but later deteriorated when the boron concentration was further increased; however, the coefficient of friction values decreased monotonically when the content of boron was increased. The initial improvement in the wear performance was due to the increased hardness. Furthermore, potentiodynamic polarisation analysis shows that the film with the highest boron content had the best corrosion resistance properties. This improvement is as a result of the evolution of the film's microstructure by the introduction of boron.","Asempah, Isaac;Xu, Junhua;Yu, Lihua;Wang, Lei",2019-10-15,Ceramics International,"Reactive magnetron sputtering,Ta–B–N films,Mechanical properties,Tribological and corrosion properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.192,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.192
"Structural analysis and characterization of doped spinel Co2−x M x TiO4 (M=Mg2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+) coated mica composite pigments","A new kind of composite mica pigments were prepared by coating Co2−x M x TiO4 composite oxide nanoparticles onto mica, to investigate the effects of doping ions Mg2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ on the properties of the doped composite pearlescent pigments, such as the crystal structure, color and shading power. The structure, morphology, color and shading power of the coated pigments were characterized by the X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV–vis spectrophotometer and CIE L*a*b* methods.

Research of the doped composite pigments showed that the doping ions had entered into the spinel crystal structure, forming a new kind of composite mica pearlescent pigments coated with Co2−x M x TiO4. For the analysis of color and shading power of the pigments, doping of Ni2+ and Zn2+ can improve the color and shading power of the doped pigments, but the larger dosage of Zn2+ doping can weaken the color and shading power of the doped pigments.

Characterization of TiCN and TiCN/ZrN coatings for cutting tool application,"Coating a cutting tool improves wear resistance and prolongs tool life. Coating performance strongly depends on the mechanical and chemical properties of the coating material. In a machining process, the type of selected coating depends on the cutting condition because of the properties of the applied coating material. In addition, many factors, such as coating thickness, composition ratio, sequences of layers in multilayer coatings, and the deposition method influence the performance of a coating. In this study, the mechanical properties of TiCN and TiCN/ZrN were investigated using a ball on disk test. The substrate material made from a carbide-based cutting tool was also developed in-house. The analysis performed shows that the performances of TiCN and TiCN/ZrN coatings were found to be comparable to that of the commercial TiN-coated carbide-based cutting tool.

Low temperature preparation and electric properties of highly (100)-oriented (Na0.85K0.15)0.5Bi0.5TiO3 thin films prepared by a sol–gel route,"Lead-free (Na0.85K0.15)0.5Bi0.5TiO3 thin films with different spin-coating layers were fabricated by a sol–gel process using a 15nm-thick Pb0.8La0.1Ca0.1Ti0.975O3 seed layer. The phase composition and electrical properties of the thin films were investigated in detail. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that low-temperature growth of (Na0.85K0.15)0.5Bi0.5TiO3 thin films—as low as 500°C—was successfully achieved. The films, comprising six layers, featured both rhombohedra and tetragonal phases near the morphotropic phase boundary. In contrast, the films fabricated with 9 and 12 layers consisted of single phase only. Additionally, a slow interfacial diffusion was achieved, owing to the low crystallization temperature. The six-layer thin film that crystallized at a low temperature exhibited enhanced electrical properties when the external electric field was small, which was attributed to the co-existence of multiple phases and an unhindered interface.","Chi, Q.G.;Cui, Y.;Chen, Y.;Lin, J.Q.;Wang, X.;Lei, Q.Q.",2016-02-01,Ceramics International,"A.

Water vapor corrosion behavior and failure mechanism of plasma sprayed mullite/Lu2Si2O7-Lu2SiO5 coatings,"A new coating with mullite as the inner layer and Lu2Si2O7-Lu2SiO5 (lutetium disilicate-lutetium monosilicate, LuDS-LuMS) composite as the top layer was designed and fabricated on the surface of porous SiC substrate by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS). The microstructure evolution, phase transformation, inter-diffusion and failure mechanism of the coated samples during steam cycling at 1450 °C were systemically investigated. The results indicated that the coated samples maintain weight gain and the average weight gain rate is 1.12 × 10−1 mg/cm2 h. The thermal expansion coefficient (CTE) mismatches between the coating and the substrate as well as between the two ceramic layers have produced a thermal mismatch stress. In addition, the chemical reaction induced the sintering of LuDS-LuMS layer, the amorphous-crystalline phase transformation and the transformation between LuDS and LuMS phases could result in aging stress. With the accumulation of thermal mismatch stress and aging stress, the through and horizontal cracks have appeared in the coating, leading to the coating failure.","Hu, Xunxun;Xu, Fangfang;Li, Kunwei;Jin, Gen;Xu, Yue;Zhao, Xinqing",2018-08-15,Ceramics International,"Lutetium silicates,Environmental barrier coatings,Inter-diffusion,Corrosion,Failure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.020,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.020
Calcium phosphate–calcium titanate composite coatings for orthopedic applications,"Novel bioactive calcium titanate–tricalcium phosphate–tetracalcium phosphate composite coatings were developed. Powder mixtures of hydroxyapatite and 25, 50 and 75vol% of calcium titanate were uniaxially pressed and sintered at 1100–1200°C for 4h. After heat treatment, the composites, which consisted of calcium titanate and oxyhydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2−2x O x □ x ), were evaporated by magnetron sputtering to coat an AISI 304/Ti buffer layer substrate. Calcium phosphate (CP) and calcium titanate (CT) coatings were also produced for comparison. The surface topography of the composite coatings was observed by SEM and AFM. Their structure and composition were evaluated by XRD, FTIR and XPS, and the re-assembly process of the atoms from composite targets to the coatings was emphasized. Nanoindentation experiments were carried out to measure the hardness. Coated samples were immersed in a simulated body fluid (SBF) for 30 days under physiological conditions of pH and temperature for the in-vitro bioactivity assessment. Finally, because the coatings are proposed for orthopedic applications, the cytotoxicity of the coatings was examined with human osteoblasts. It was found that calcium titanate coating is harder than the calcium phosphate coating, the 75–25 composite coatings fit a rule of mixture of hardness, and the rougher coatings contained a larger amount of nano-scale precipitated apatite. Furthermore, all the coatings were not cytotoxic. The results indicate that 75%CP–25%CT coating is a potential material for bone tissue replacement and regeneration.","Arce, J. Esguerra;Arce, A.

Preparation of crystalline ytterbium disilicate environmental barrier coatings using suspension plasma spray,"In high-speed modern industries, high-temperature stability of materials is essential. A promising high-temperature material currently attracting attention is silicon carbide (SiC)-based ceramic matrix composites (CMC). However, a disadvantage of these materials is their reduced lifetime in an oxidizing atmosphere. To overcome this, environmental barrier coating can be employed. In this study, we aimed to fabricate an environmental barrier coating using suspension plasma spray with Yb2Si2O7, which exhibits excellent oxidation resistance and a similar thermal expansion coefficient to SiC. To prepare the crystalline Yb2Si2O7 coating layer, the gas concentration of the plasma spray was adjusted, and then the suspension manufacturing solvent was adjusted and sprayed. The prepared coating samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscopes, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to determine phase and microstructure changes. Highly crystalline ytterbium disilicate was observed at low plasma enthalpy with no hydrogen and 20% addition of water.","Ryu, Ho-lim;Lee, Sung-Min;Han, Yoon-Soo;Choi, Kyun;An, Gye Seok;Nahm, Sahn;Oh, Yoon-Suk",2019-04-01,Ceramics International,"Environmental barrier coatings,Ceramic matrix composite,Suspension plasma spray,Silicon carbide",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.048,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.048
Formation of β-NiAl nanocomposite coating by electrodeposition and effect of cerium ion doping on its oxidation mechanism,"NiAl films were synthesized by electrodeposition of aluminum nanoparticles into the Ni matrix from a Watts bath and then were heat treated. The effects of current density and aluminum particles concentration on the particles distribution and the coating chemical composition were studied. It was observed that the Al concentration in the obtained NiAl coating is maximum (48.5at%) at the current density of 4Adm−2 for the coating solution with Al particles concentration of 50gl−1. It was found oxidation resistance of the coating to improve in the presence of cerium ion up to 1mM and then to decrease. Results of XPS analysis showed that cerium ion addition to the coating caused the formation of cerium oxide in both Ce3+ and Ce4+ states. During oxidation at 1000°C, Ce3+ is converted to Ce4+. Consequently, oxygen vacancy decreases possibly leading to the increase of the oxidation resistance.","Hassannejad, Hossein;Nouri, Ashkan",2017-09-30,Ceramics International,"NiAl Nanocomposite coating,Electrodeposition,Cerium ion,Oxidation mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.010
Design and preparation of composite coatings with increased reflectivity under high-energy continuous wave laser ablation,"High-energy continuous wave (CW) laser ablation can cause severe damage to structural materials in an extremely short time, which generates considerable concern in terms of material safety. For the purpose of reducing or even eliminating such laser-induced damage, a novel composite coating consisting of a boron-modified phenolic formaldehyde resin incorporating ZrC and SiC has been designed and prepared. The experimental results reveal that ZrC and SiC are rapidly oxidized to ZrO2 and SiO2 respectively, leading to the formation of a white ceramic layer consisting of ZrO2 particles and melted SiO2. After ablation at 1000 W/cm2 for 50 s, elemental analysis indicates that no Si can be found in the central ablation zone because of gasification. A relatively compact ZrO2 layer is formed through the sintering of adjacent ZrO2 particles, which effectively improves the reflectivity of the coating from 7.3% (before ablation) to 63.5% (after ablation). The high reflectivity greatly reduces the absorption of laser energy. In addition, no obvious ablation defects are observed in the composite coating. The excellent anti-laser ablation performance of the coating makes it a promising system for protecting a material against the effects of long-term CW laser ablation.","Xu, Weiye;Gao, Lihong;Ma, Chen;Ma, Zhuang;Wu, Taotao;Rogachev, Alexandr A.;Wang, Fuchi",2020-10-15,Ceramics International,"Composite coating,Laser ablation behavior,Anti-laser ablation ability,Reflectivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.115,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.115
Prepare SiTiOC ceramic coatings by laser pyrolysis of titanium organosilicon compound,"A SiTiOC ceramic coating with outstanding tribological performance was prepared by laser scanning the organosilicon coating with different laser power. The composition and structure of the obtained SiTiOC ceramic coatings were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectra, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The tribological performance of the coatings was studied using a multi-functional reciprocating friction and wear tester. The results showed that the chemical structure (chemical bonding) of the coatings prepared at 0W, 350W, and 500W laser powers included Si-O-Si, Si-C, and TiO2, while that prepared at 800W was mainly composed of amorphous SiO2, indicating that the coating had higher ceramization. The SiTiOC ceramic coatings prepared by the present process effectively reduced the friction coefficient and wear volume of the steel substrate, which indicated that they had good anti-friction and wear resistance properties.","Qiao, Yulin;Zhao, Jixin;Liu, Jun;Huang, Kening",2018-05-31,Ceramics International,"Laser pyrolysis,Titanium organosilicon compound,Ceramic coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.241,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.241
Using PyC coated short chopped carbon fiber to tackle the dilemma between toughness and strength of ZrC-SiC,"Graceful toughness and high strength are mutually exclusive in engineering ZrC-SiC ceramic, which are hard to be possessed simultaneously. Here, the pyrolytic carbon (PyC) coated short chopped carbon fibers were utilized to toughen ZrC-SiC ceramic, tackling the dilemma between toughness and strength. Through the uniform incorporation of PyC coated short chopped carbon fibers, the penetration crack mode of ZrC-SiC was changed into an obviously deflecting propagation path with closed phenomenon. The PyC coating brought about a relatively weak interface bonding and guided the crack propagate along the weak interface, consequently resulting in a more flexuous crack propagation instead of passing through the fibers directly. Meanwhile, the fibers received effective protection of coating inhibiting from performance degradation. The PyC coated Cf/ZrC-SiC obtained a fracture toughness highly reaching 7.57 ± 0.33 MPa m1/2 with a rivaling flexural strength at 268 ± 16 MPa. Moreover, the graceful load-displacement curve is illustrated with a smoothly extended displacement of 0.12 mm and increased load to 83 N, which forms an obvious yield plateau. To some degree, this work provided an effective solution to tackling the dilemma between toughness and strength of engineering ZrC-SiC ceramic.","Cheng, Yuan;Liu, Chang;Hu, Ping;Sun, Boqian;Hu, Peitao;Ma, Chen;Fang, Cheng;Zhang, Dongyang;Feng, Jiaxin;Du, Shanyi",2019-01-31,Ceramics International,"PyC coating,Carbon fiber,ZrC,Toughness,Strength",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.196,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.196
Coating of ZnO nanoparticles onto the inner pore channel surface of SiC foam to fabricate a novel antibacterial air filter material,"ZnO nanoparticles layer was successfully and firmly coated onto the surface of the pore channel of SiC foam via a sol–gel method in the presence of a negative pressure suction to fabricate a novel anti-bacterial air filter material. Composition, structure and morphology of the coated ZnO were characterized by scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy. A possible formation mechanism of ZnO was proposed. A high crystallized ZnO nanoparticles layer was formed when the calcination temperature exceeds 500°C. The coated ZnO crystallites were hexagonal wurtzite and the grain size was in the range of 20–50nm. No evident N2 permeability difference was detected in gas permeation tests before and after ZnO nanoparticles coating. ZnO-coated SiC foam was found to exhibit an excellent anti-bacterial property with sterilization rate of Escherichia coli exceeding 99.8% for all modified samples.","Hu, Jian;Zhong, Zhaoxiang;Zhang, Feng;Xing, Weihong;Low, Ze-Xian;Fan, Yiqun",2015-06-30,Ceramics International,"ZnO nanoparticles,SiC foam,Antibacterial air filter,Gas permeability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.02.016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.02.016
Mechanical and microwave dielectric properties of KD-I SiCf/SiC composites fabricated through precursor infiltration and pyrolysis,"SiC fiber-reinforced SiC matrix (SiCf/SiC) composites, which employ a new type of KD-I SiC fibers (provided by the National University of Defense Technology, China) with in situ pyrocarbon (PyC) coating on the surface of the fibers as reinforcements, are fabricated through precursor infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP). The characteristics of the fiber surface are evaluated by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The mechanical and dielectric properties of KD-I SiCf/SiC composites are reported, and the effects of in situ PyC coating on the material properties are investigated. Results show that the KD-I SiC fiber has a special “skin (PyC phase)-core (SiCO phase)” structure. The composites possess excellent mechanical properties because of the in situ PyC coating on the surface of the fibers. The flexural strength and toughness are 268.8MPa and 12.9MPam1/2, respectively. However, the dielectric constants are also remarkable, which is disadvantageous to microwave absorbing applications.","Tian, Hao;Liu, Hai-tao;Cheng, Hai-feng",2014-08-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Comparative study on oxidation behavior of Ti2AlN coatings in air and pure steam,"The oxidation behavior of the Ti2AlN coatings is comparatively investigated at 750 °C in air and in pure steam conditions, respectively. The linear kinetics composed of two stages is observed for each case, suggesting a chemical reaction determining process, and the second stage behaves a slightly higher oxidation rate. In air, the oxidation behavior exhibits an inhomogeneous oxidation due to the presence of macro-particles and impurity phases in the coating, while a transition from inhomogeneous oxidation to homogeneous oxidation occurs in pure steam. Compared to that in air, the oxidation process in pure steam is accelerated, leading to higher mass gains. XRD and EDX analyses indicate that Al easily diffuses to the surface and thus forms α-Al2O3 layer under the two atmospheres, which result from the high Al activity within MAX phase. Additionally, the scaling mechanism of Ti2AlN coatings is discussed in terms of the microstructure evolution.","Wang, Zhenyu;Li, Xiaowei;Li, Wentao;Ke, Peiling;Wang, Aiying",2019-05-31,Ceramics International,"MAX phase,Oxidation mechanism,Pure steam,Linear kinetics,Al2O3 layer",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.004
Influence of Ag mid-layer in the optical and thermal properties of ZnO/Ag/ZnO thin films on the glass used in Buildings as insulating glass unit (IGU),"The low-emissivity (low-E) coatings are multiple ultra thin layers on glass used for producing spectrally selective glazing. The use of low-E glazing in building windows makes it possible limit the radiative heat transfer without reducing the visible transmittance perceptibly and accordingly alter the necessary natural lighting in low energy buildings. In this study, we investigate ZnO/Ag/ZnO thin films deposited on glass substrate via RF and DC sputtering by ZnO and Ag targets respectively, in various deposition time of Ag layer. We tried to diminish the NIR transmittance by using a feasible and affordable method with a low number of ultra thin layers and by reducing the cost of the vacuum.

Supersonic flame ablation resistance of W/ZrC coating deposited on C/SiC composites by atmosphere plasma spraying,"To improve the ablation resistance of C/SiC composites, in this study, double-layer coatings, with W as inner layer and ZrC as outer layer, were prepared by atmosphere plasma spraying. The coatings exhibited a dense structure, a good bonding with substrate and outstanding anti-ablation ability. After the coated composites were ablated at the distance of 100mm for 60s, the mass and linear ablation rates were 29.5×10−2 gs−1 and 5.33×10−3 mms−1, decreasing by 38.2% and 56.7% respectively, compared with those of uncoated composites. The mechanical denudation played a principal role in the ablation of the ZrC outer layer. The gas release during ablation could take away a lot of heat. The melting of WO3 could also consume lots of heat, and form a dense surface which was helpful to protect the composites. During the 200mm ablation, WO3 needle-like crystals were formed.","Wen, Bo;Ma, Zhuang;Liu, Yanbo;Wang, Fuchi;Cai, Hongnian;Gao, Lihong",2014-09-30,Ceramics International,"C/SiC composites,ZrC,W,Ablation,Supersonic flame",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.04.016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.04.016
Effect of concentration of DOC loaded TiO2 nanotubes on the corrosion behavior of smart coatings,"The present work focuses on synthesis and characterization of novel polymeric based smart coatings containing various amount of titania nanotubes (TiO2) encapsulated with dodecylamine (DOC). The novelty of the current research work resides on the fact that the encapsulation of TiO2 nanotubes with DOC and its inhibition effect in polymeric smart coatings have not been previously reported. Towards this direction, TiO2 nanotubes with an average size of ⁓10–15 nm (as confirmed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis) were synthesized through a hydrothermal process and were then impregnated with DOC. Various contents of the encapsulated TiO2 nanotubes (1, 3 and 5 wt%) were thoroughly dispersed into the epoxy matrix and the resulting composites were then applied on a cleaned steel substrate using doctor blade technique to develop smart coatings. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis confirms the impregnation of TiO2 nanotubes with DOC. The encapsulated amount of DOC in TiO2 nanotubes was estimated by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The UV–vis spectroscopy study demonstrates time dependent self-release of encapsulated DOC from the TiO2 nanotubes in response to pH change of the corrosive medium. TGA and FTIR analyses also indicate that different amounts of encapsulated TiO2 nanotubes dispersed into smart coatings do not degrade their structural and thermal properties. Moreover, a decrease in the corrosion rate of smart coatings with increasing amount of encapsulated TiO2 nanotubes in the EIS analysis confirms their superior anticorrosive performance. This improvement in corrosion resistance can be attributed to the efficient and high amount of DOC released from the encapsulated TiO2 nanotubes. A decent improvement of corrosion resistance make these smart coatings attractive for industrial applications.","Ubaid, Fareeha;Naeem, Nazal;Shakoor, R.A.;Kahraman, Ramazan;Mansour, Said;Zekri, Atef",2019-06-01,Ceramics International,"Nanotubes,Smart coatings,Inhibitor,Corrosion,Impedance,Bode plot,Phase angle",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.111,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.111
Thermal shock properties of 3D-C/SiC composites prepared via polymer infiltration pyrolysis (PIP),"SiC ceramic matrix composites reinforced by three-dimensional braided carbon fibers were prepared via polymer infiltration pyrolysis (PIP). The thermal shock properties of C/SiC composites were investigated in air. 3D-C/SiC specimens were thermally shocked for five cycles between 1500°C and 100°C. The thermal shock resistance was characterized by mass variation and residual flexural strength properties. Scanning electron microscope was used to examine the change of the surface morphology and micro-structural evolution of the composites. In addition, the phase evolution of the surfaces was identified by XRD, EDS and XPS. It was found that the strength of 3D-C/SiC composites decreased after thermal shock tests. The phase composition of 3D-C/SiC composites was mainly β-SiC and carbon. After thermal shock tests, more oxides were generated and more O atoms were detected when there was no coating on the surface of 3D-C/SiC. The matrix cracking offered the channels through which oxygen could penetrate into the composites and consume the fibers during thermal shock tests. CVD-SiC coating played an important role in enhancing the resistance to the thermal shock of the composites.","Yang, Xiang;Hu, Hai-feng;Zhang, Yu-di;Chen, Zhao-hui",2014-08-31,Ceramics International,"Oxidation,Polymer infiltration pyrolysis (PIP),C/SiC composites,Thermal shock",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.01.122,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.01.122
"Synthesis, luminescence and application of BaKYSi2O7:Eu2+: A new blue-emitting phosphor for near-UV white-light LED","A series of new silicate phosphors, Ba1-xEuxKYSi2O7 (BKY: Eu2+) (x = 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.07) have been synthesized from a water-soluble propylene glycol modified silane (PGMS) based silicon precursor by a solution approach. This phosphor can be efficiently excited by near-UV light and generates a broadband bright blue emission with internal Quantum Efficiency 34%. The detailed crystal structure of monoclinic BKY:Eu2+ was determined from the XRD profile using Rietveld refinement. Band gap was determined from Diffuse Reflectance Spectra using Kubelka Munk function. Steady state and time resolved Photoluminescence measurement as well as the thermal quenching properties of the phosphor have been investigated in detail. A highly efficient broadband blue emission centered at λmax ~ 460 nm with a full-width at half-maximum of 72 nm shows very low thermal quenching; 83.2% at 150 °C with respect to that measured at room temperature. Moreover, a white LED device has been fabricated by coating the as-synthesized phosphor with a standard red emitting CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ phosphor and a standard green emitting Ba2SiO4:Eu2+ phosphor.

Fabrication and oxidation resistant behavior of plasma sprayed Si/Yb2Si2O7/LaMgAl11O19 coating for Cf/SiC composites at 1673K,"Cf/SiC composites were plasma sprayed with Yb2Si2O7/LaMgAl11O19 coatings with and without Si bond layer. Microstructure and oxidation protection of the coatings at 1673K were investigated. The results showed that the coatings have the same phase constituent as that of the powders and uniformly distributed on the substrate. The bonding interface between the coating and substrate with Si bond layer is better than that of without Si bond layer. After 15 cycles of heating at 1673K for 90min, the weight losses of the coated samples with and without Si bond layer were 2.54% and 21.89%, respectively, however, for the uncoated sample, its weight loss was up to 36.47%. To certain extent, the Si bond layer efficiently healed the porosity on the surface of substrate and relieved the mismatch of coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between the coating and substrate, and therefore significantly improved the oxidation protection of the coating. The difference of CTEs between the coating and substrate, the chemical reactions between the LaMgAl11O19 and Yb2Si2O7 layers and the holes and cracks inside Cf/SiC composites were disadvantageous to the oxidation resistance of the coatings.","Fan, Wenjuan;Zou, Binglin;Fan, Cunyan;Wang, Ying;Cai, Xiaolong;Tao, Shunyan;Xu, Jiaying;Wang, Chunjie;Cao, Xueqiang;Zhu, Ling",2017-01-31,Ceramics International,"Cf/SiC composites,Coatings,Oxidation resistance,Plasma sprayed",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.09.171,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.09.171
New method for CO2 corrosion resistance Ni-W-Y2O3-ZrO2 nanocomposite coatings,"To obtain nanocomposite coating resistant to CO2 corrosion, new idea is proposed in this paper. First, based on first-principle method, adsorption characteristics of CO2 on different nanocomposite coatings were studied, and coating structure with CO2 corrosion resistance was optimized. Then, relevant experiments were carried out to verify corrosion resistance of coating and evaluate CO2 corrosion resistance. Results indicate that coating structure resistant to CO2 corrosion is Ni-W alloy as matrix metal; Y2O3 and ZrO2 nanoparticles are added with mass ratio of 1:1. In this case, adsorption energy of CO2 reaches the minimum, and corrosion resistance is optimal. Theoretical result was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy observation and electrochemical test of coating. When the coating is placed in CO2 environment with different partial pressures and temperatures, after a period of time, it is still dense, and no corrosion pits appear on the surface. Electrochemical test results show that the resistance of coating after CO2 corrosion is high, and corrosion resistance is still good.

Porosity and microstructural features of plasma sprayed Yttria stabilized Zirconia thermal barrier coatings,"In this paper effects of spray distance on the microstructural and porosity features of air plasma spray (APS) deposited Yttria stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) have been investigated. Microstructural details including porosity and crack densities, pore and crack types and their morphologies were studied using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM). The detailed porosity characteristics were investigated through an image analyzing process. The results indicated that in the shorter spray distances i.e. 70mm, some voids within splats are generated due to the gas entrapment because of high velocity of molten droplets/particles. By increasing the spray distance from 70mm to 130mm; (i) morphology and arrangement of the splats are changed from completely flat and well-adhered forms to coarse and less-adhered ones, (ii) the density of horizontally branched and segmented vertical cracks are decreased, (iii) pore to crack ratio is increased from 0.33 to 0.77, (iv) relative area fraction of pores in the 1–8μm size range is decreased from 42% to 27%. Among the studied coatings; the YSZ coating deposited at spray distance of 90mm exhibited desirable microstructural aspects in terms of level, size and morphology of the porosity.","Sobhanverdi, Ramazan;Akbari, Alireza",2015-12-31,Ceramics International,"B.

Comprehensive effects of TGO growth on the stress characteristic and delamination mechanism in lamellar structured thermal barrier coatings,"To clarify the role of thermally grown oxide (TGO) in the failure of thermal barrier coating system (TBCs) is beneficial to further understand coating spallation mechanism and optimize the spraying process. In this study, the influences of TGO growth on the stress state and crack growth behavior upon temperature cycling are quantitatively examined based on a novel model with lamellar structure. Three kinds of TGO growth modes are employed to explore the TGO growth effect. The non-uniform distribution of lateral growth strain through TGO thickness is included in the model. TGO growth is dynamically modeled using the material property change step by step. The successive propagation and coalescence of multi-crack are materialized by a fracture mechanics analysis. The results suggest that the continuous increase of tensile and shear stress with cycles can occur only when the lateral growth strain is considered into the TGO. Large stress concentration arises at the crack tip and near the pore, which is responsible for the early crack growth. The successive growth and linkage of multi-crack can be expected in the model with TGO lateral growth. The spallation path and the variation trend of total crack length achieved in the current model are in line with the results in experiments. The large gradient of lateral strain distribution in TGO will result in a higher cycle to failure and incubation period. However, the overall crack propagation behavior and linkage mechanism are not affected by the lateral strain distribution. The computational results in the current model can provide a theoretical foundation for developing advanced TBCs with long lifetime.","Wei, Zhi-Yuan;Cai, Hong-Neng",2020-02-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs),Lamellar or layered structure,Thermally grown oxide (TGO),Crack propagation,Delamination and failure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.207,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.207
Facile synthesis and performance of polypyrrole-coated hollow Zn2SnO4 boxes as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries,"Polypyrrole-coated hollow Zn2SnO4 boxes (hollow Zn2SnO4@PPY nanocomposites) had been prepared by a microemulsion polymerization. The structural, morphological and electrochemical properties were methodically investigated by means of XRD, TGA, BJH (pore size distribution analysis), SEM, TEM, and electrochemical measurements. Results show that the hollow Zn2SnO4 boxes with the uniform and cube like structure are coated by PPY. Electrochemical measurement suggests that hollow Zn2SnO4@PPY composites exhibit better cycling properties and lower initial irreversible capacities as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. At a current density of 60mA/g in the voltage about 0.01–3.0V, the first discharge–charge capacities of hollow Zn2SnO4@PPY composites are 1105.2mAh/g and 556mAh/g. After 50 cycles, a specific charge capacity of 478.4mAh/g remained and the coulombic efficiency reaches 98.2%, revealing better capacity retention compared with hollow Zn2SnO4 boxes.","Wang, Ke;Huang, Ying;Han, Tiaozheng;Zhao, Yang;Huang, Haijian;Xue, Lele",2014-01-31,Ceramics International,"Hollow structure,Zn2SnO4,PPY coating,Lithium battery,Anode materials",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.08.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.08.006
Magnesia sinter hydration–dehydration behavior in refractory castables,"Magnesia (MgO) easily reacts with water when exposed to humidity or during the mixing of refractory castables, resulting a Mg(OH)2 coating layer on a particles’ surface. When castables dewater (above 350°C), this coating begins to decompose, generating porosity and a highly reactive magnesia. Despite the abundant literature concerning magnesia hydration–dehydration mechanisms, few studies were related to refractories. In the present work, aqueous suspensions of thermally treated magnesia sinter were prepared and the influence of the calcination temperature on magnesia reactivity was evaluated by the apparent volumetric expansion (AVE) measurements. Based on these results, the drying behavior of magnesia sinter containing castables was related to mechanical strength and porosity measurements. The effects of re-hydration damages caused by humidity exposition after drying were also investigated.","Salomão, Rafael;Pandolfelli, Victor C.",2008-12-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Control of aluminum phosphate coating on mullite fibers by surface modification with polyethylenimine,"Aluminum phosphate (AlPO4) is a promising oxidation-resistant and weak interface for ceramic-matrix composites. In this research, AlPO4 coating was deposited on mullite fibers by an improved liquid-phase method based on electrostatic attraction. A cationic polyelectrolyte, polyethylenimine (PEI), was used for surface modification of mullite fibers. The formation process, phase evolution and microstructure of the coating were studied. The zeta potential of AlPO4 particles, PEI-adsorbed AlPO4 particles, and PEI-adsorbed mullite particles was characterized to find the proper pH value for improving electrostatic attraction. The obtained AlPO4 coating was porous and continuous, whose thickness could be controlled by multiple coating cycles. The relatively low calcination temperature (600 or 1000°C) was a useful heat treatment method to develop bonding between coating and fiber as well as reduce the fiber strength degradation. The phase transformations of AlPO4 have little volume change, and cristobalite AlPO4 is thermal compatible with mullite. Therefore, the coating structure was preserved after calcining at 1200°C. The technique is also applicable for other fibers contained mullite phase to fabricate high-performance AlPO4 coated mullite/mullite composites.","Chen, Chao;Feng, Bo;Hu, Shujuan;Zhang, Yue;Li, Song;Gao, Longfei;Zhang, Xuemei;Yu, Kun",2018-01-31,Ceramics International,"Ceramic-matrix composites,AlPO4 coating,Electrostatic attraction,Phase transformation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.161,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.161
3D interconnected porous carbon coated Na3V2(PO4)3/C composite cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries,"3D interconnected porous carbon coated Na3V2(PO4)3/C (NVP/C) composites were calcined after production using an improved sol-gel combustion method. A large surface area was produced from the porous structure, providing a charge transfer across the electrode/electrolyte interface, thereby shortening ion diffusion lengths. A 3D conductive network beneficial to electronic transport was formed by covering the thin walls of the 3D interconnected pores with a uniform and amorphous carbon layer. The electrochemical performance of the NVP/C composite was notably impacted by the thickness of the carbon layer, determined by the residual carbon content. When the precursor was added with 10 wt% glucose, the final NVP/C-G10% composite, having an optimum carbon layer thickness, achieved an exceptional electrochemical property, making it suitable for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). At the rate of 0.2C, the NVP/C-G10% composite possessed a high capacity of 118.0 mAh/g. With a rate of 10 C, the NVP/C-G10% electrode exhibited an initial reversible capacity of 64.4 mAh/g; after 1000 cycles this electrode has a retention capacity of 81.5%. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results indicated that, under lower polarization, NVP/C-G10% composite had an increased sodium ion diffusion coefficient and reduced transfer resistance charge, resulting in a high rate performance and cyclic stability.","Li, Nali;Tong, Yanwei;Yi, Dawei;Cui, Xumei;Zhang, Xuefeng",2020-12-01,Ceramics International,"Sol-gel combustion method,Na3V2(PO4)3,Porous,Carbon coating,Sodium-ion batteries",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.238,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.238
Effects of interlayer roughness on deposition rate and morphology of aerosol-deposited Al2O3 thick films,"The influence of the surface roughness of Al2O3 interlayers on the growth of Al2O3 thick films fabricated by an aerosol deposition (AD) process was investigated as an approach to improving the plasma resistance of the films. The Al2O3 interlayer was fabricated by a plasma electrolytic oxide (PEO) method. This method is capable of fabricating films on the entire surface area of 3-dimensional substrates, whereas the AD process has difficulties with depositing films on complex shapes, such as on edges and corners, and inside holes. To prevent degradation of the plasma resistance with increasing working time, the thickness of the Al2O3 interlayer was increased by the PEO method. The surface roughness of the Al2O3 interlayer was increased linearly by increasing the thickness of the Al2O3 interlayer. On Al2O3 interlayers with surface roughness values of more than 1.5μm (R a), Al2O3 films were not grown by the AD process. To investigate the effect of the surface roughness of the Al2O3 interlayer on the growth of Al2O3 films on the Al2O3 interlayer, we attempted to deposit Al2O3 films on an Al2O3 interlayer whose surface roughness was decreased from 1.5μm to 0.8μm by polishing. As a result, an Al2O3 film of 2.0μm in thickness was grown by the AD process. These study results support the conclusion that controlling of the surface roughness is the most important factor in aerosol-deposited film growth.","Kim, Chang-Wan;Choi, Joo-Hyun;Kim, Hyung-Jun;Lee, Dong-Won;Hyun, Chang-Yong;Nam, Song-Min",2012-09-30,Ceramics International,"D.

Sliding wear characteristics of plasma-sprayed Cr2O3 coatings with incorporation of metals and ceramics,"Different additives (metals, ceramics, and metal/ceramic assembles) were incorporated into chromium oxide (Cr2O3) coatings to improve its wear resistance. The doping or co-doping effects were compared in terms of the microstructure, phase composition, microhardness and sliding wear properties of plasma-sprayed Cr2O3-7wt.% Mo, Cr2O3-7wt.% Nb2O5, Cr2O3-4wt.% MoO3-3wt.% Mo, and Cr2O3-4wt.% Nb2O5-3wt.% Mo coatings. Under the low sliding loads, the composite coatings mated with WC-Co counterparts have lower friction coefficients than those against Si3N4, which are inverse with their microhardnesses, but more obvious fatigue wear characteristics. Under the high sliding loads, Mo/Nb2O5 co-doped Cr2O3 coating (CNM) has the best wear resistance than other coatings, due to the delaying co-effects of crack formation and propagation on basis of the crack deflection and the toughening effects of Mo additives and the high hardness of Nb2O5 additives. As the reciprocating sliding loads exceed the critical stress of brittle Cr2O3-based coatings, the coating detachments occur, displaying obvious fatigue wear characteristics.","Yang, Xiong;Dong, Shujuan;Zeng, Jinyan;Zhou, Xin;Jiang, Jianing;Deng, Longhui;Cao, Xueqiang",2019-11-30,Ceramics International,"Cr2O3 composite coatings,Atmospheric plasma spraying (APS),Metal/ceramic doping/incorporation,Sliding wear",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.297,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.297
Hot corrosion of RE2SiO5 with different cation substitution under calcium–magnesium–aluminosilicate attack,"Rare earth (RE) silicates have been applied as advanced environmental barrier coatings (EBCs) to protect silicon carbide fibers reinforced silicon carbide ceramic matrix from water vapor and molten salt corrosion in engines. This process, however, is limited by volcanic ash corrosion as assessment of ash-induced corrosion is anecdotal and quantitative data are insufficient. In this account, the corrosion behavior of RE monosilicates (RE2SiO5, RE = Y, Lu, Yb, Eu, Gd, and La) by calcium–magnesium–aluminosilicate (CMAS), with similar composition as volcanic ash, was comprehensively investigated. Results indicated that RE2SiO5 could react with CMAS at 1200°C at the interface, where the products crystallized in CMAS glass. RE2Si2O7 was formed by the reaction between RE2SiO5 and silica (SiO2) in CMAS, which was followed by corrosion of RE2Si2O7 by CMAS. RE2SiO5 with Type B structure showed better resistance toward CMAS than RE2SiO5 with Type A structure. Moreover, RE2SiO5 with larger radii of RE3+ cations led to easy formation of oxyapatite phase; however, RE2SiO5 with smaller radii of RE3+ cations easily formed garnet phase. Besides, smaller radii RE3+ cations induced slower reactions. These findings can contribute to identifying, preventing, and minimizing the damage to matrix components with EBCs caused by volcanic ash.","Jiang, Fengrui;Cheng, Laifei;Wang, Yiguang",2017-08-15,Ceramics International,"Corrosion,Calcium–magnesium–aluminosilicate,Environmental barrier coatings,Rare earth monosilicate",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.045,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.045
"Phase stability and thermal conductivity of RE2O3 (RE=La, Nd, Gd, Yb) and Yb2O3 co-doped Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 ceramics","Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) has been considered as the material of choice for thermal barrier coatings (TBCs), but it becomes unstable at high temperatures and its thermal conductivity needs to be further reduced. In this study, 1mol% RE2O3 (RE=La, Nd, Gd, Yb) and 1mol% Yb2O3 co-doped YSZ (1RE1Yb–YSZ) were fabricated to obtain improved phase stability and reduced thermal conductivity. For 1RE1Yb–YSZ ceramics, the phase stability of metastable tetragonal (t′) phase increased with decreasing RE3+ size, mainly attributable to the reduced driving force for t′ phase partitioning. The thermal conductivity of 1RE1Yb–YSZ was lower than that of YSZ, with the value decreasing with the increase of the RE3+ size mainly due to the increased elastic field in the lattice, but 1La1Yb–YSZ exhibited undesirably high thermal conductivity. By considering the comprehensive properties, 1Gd1Yb–YSZ ceramic could be a good potential material for TBC applications.","Guo, Lei;Li, Mingzhu;Ye, Fuxing",2016-05-01,Ceramics International,"C.

Structure of the hydroxyapatite plasma-sprayed coatings deposited on pre-heated titanium substrates,"Plasma spraying is the most commonly used thermal spray method for the application of hydroxyapatite (HA, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) coatings. In the present study, the HA coatings were plasma spraying deposited onto plates of titanium pre-heated to 20°C, 300°C and 550°C. The obtained HA coatings were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. It is found that the coatings, in addition to HA, contain the tetracalcium phosphate (TTCP, (Ca4(PO4)2O) phase (~10%) and a small amount of CaO (<2%). Crystal structure of HA in the coatings is revealed to be distorted. The PO4 tetrahedrons are deformed (Baur distortion coefficient D1(TO) ~0.2). The distances Ca1-O1 and Ca1-O2 are changed as compared to these in stoichiometric hydroxyapatite. These distortions are considered as a result of internal stresses, which are demonstrated in the broadening of peaks on X-ray diffraction pattern of HA. Microstructure of coatings consisting of flattened splats was formed by fully molten particles. The axial base texture was developed in the coatings. Ultrastructure is columnar with a preferred orientation of c-axes of the crystals parallel to the normal of plane coating n. The heating of substrate has a marked effect on the ultrastructure of coatings: the domain size increases from 790 to 1100Å, the strain Δ decreases from 1.6·10-3 to 1,2·10–3, TTCP content diminishes from 12% to 7%. These results show that the effects due to heating of the substrate may be associated with partial recovery of HA microstructure.","Shamray, V.F.;Sirotinkin, V.P.;Smirnov, I.V.;Kalita, V.I.;Fedotov, A.Yu.;Barinov, S.M.;Komlev, V.S.",2017-08-15,Ceramics International,"A.

Liquid polycarbosilane-derived C/C–SiC composites with improved mechanical strength for high temperature applications,"In the present study, liquid polycarbosilane (LPCS) has been synthesized in the form of low viscous resin, by the heat-treatment of polydimethylsilane (PDMS) in an autoclave at 400°C for 5h. The spectral and thermal characterizations carried out at different processing stages indicate the formation of polycarbosilane with high Si–H content. LPCS gave ceramic residue of 34% at 900°C in argon atmosphere. XRD pattern of 1500°C heat-treated LPCS, indicates the formation of silicon carbide. LPCS was used as infiltrating resin for the preparation of C/C–SiC composite without any interfacial coating over the T-300 carbon fabric reinforcement. Flexural strength value of 64MPa for C/C–SiC specimen with density of 1.36g/cm3 was obtained after six infiltration and pyrolysis cycles. Fractured surface was characterized by SEM which indicates the formation of nano- to submicron wires in the pores of the hybrid composite.","Swaminathan, B.;Painuly, Anil;Prabhakaran, P.V.;Packirisamy, S.",2015-04-30,Ceramics International,"D: SiC,Ceramic matrix composite,Structural material",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.10.185,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.10.185
Enhanced electrochemical performance of LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathodes by cerium doping and graphene coating,"Plain and cerium-doped LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathode materials were prepared via a combustion method, then graphene was coated onto the materials by a physical method. The results of x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy confirmed the presence of a graphene coating layer on the LiNi0.497Ce0.003Co0.2Mn0.3O2 samples, the stratified structure and surface appearance of which were identical to those of LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2. The 3 wt% graphene-coated LiNi0.497Ce0.003Co0.2Mn0.3O2 samples showed enhanced electrochemical performance with retention of 77.47% capacity over 50 cycles, compared with 72.02% for uncoated samples. Moreover, 3 wt% graphene-coated LiNi0.497Ce0.003Co0.2Mn0.3O2 sustained superior discharge-specific capacity and better stability at high current densities such as 2C. Cation disordering was decreased by inhibition of the side effects inherent in charge-discharge processes, which gave rise to more stable structures. These enhancements in the electrochemical performance of LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 can be attributed to cerium doping and graphene coating.","Xu, Huan;Ai, Li;Yan, Jinyan;Yan, Guilin;Zhang, Wentao",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Lithium-ion batteries,LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2,Cerium doping,Graphene,Electrochemical performance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.001
Electrophoretic deposition of nanocomposite (HAp+TiO2) on titanium alloy for biomedical applications,"This paper reports on the corrosion and scratch behavior of TiO2 +50%HAp nanoceramic coated Ti–13Nb–13Zr orthopedic implant alloy. An adherent thin coating was obtained using the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique at 30V and sintering at 850°C. The microstructure of the coated surfaces was characterized by optical microscopy, AFM, and SEM, and the composition of the coating was examined using EDAX. The functional groups and formed phases analyzed using FT-IR, and XRD. Further, the adhesion strength of the coatings was evaluated using scratch tester and the corrosion behavior of all samples was tested in Simulated Body Fluid (SBF-Hank's solution) using a potentiodynamic polarization studies. The sintered coating exhibited higher adhesion, lower porosity and higher density compared to unsintered samples, and higher corrosion resistance compared to the substrate. However, the corrosion resistance of the unsintered coating was superior to that of the sintered one due to the presence of minimal interconnected porosity.","Mohan, L.;Durgalakshmi, D.;Geetha, M.;Sankara Narayanan, T.S.N.;Asokamani, R.",2012-05-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Optical properties of Nb-doped TiO2 thin films prepared by sol–gel method,"In this work, we studied optical properties of pure and Nb-doped TiO2 synthesized using a sol–gel method and deposited as thin films by spin-coating followed by annealing in air at 500°C for 1h. The surface elemental composition was derived from X-ray photoelectron spectra, while structure and surface morphology were investigated using X-ray diffraction and atomic force/scanning electron microscopy. Finally, the optical properties were investigated by means of UV–vis spectrophotometry and spectroscopic ellipsometry. The Nb content was determined from XPS measurements to vary between 1.8 and 4.3at%. The XRD patterns of the deposited thin films, with a maximum thickness of about 56nm, showed no diffraction peaks. As proven both by microscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry studies doping TiO2 with Nb modified the surface morphology of the samples; the grain size is increasing while the surface roughness decreases with the increase in Nb content. This is accompanied by a decrease in the refractive index and an increase of the extinction coefficient.","Manole, A.V.;Dobromir, M.;Gîrtan, M.;Mallet, R.;Rusu, G.;Luca, D.",2013-07-31,Ceramics International,"Nb-doped TiO2,Sol–gel,Thin films,Spectroscopic ellipsometry",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.11.066,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.11.066
Computational investigation of porosity effects on fracture behavior of thermal barrier coatings,"The influence of microstructural pore defects on fracture behaviour of Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBC) is analysed using finite element analysis involving cohesive elements. A concurrent multiscale approach is utilised whereby the microstructural features of the TBC are explicitly resolved within a unit cell embedded in a larger domain. Within the unit cell, a random distribution of pores is modelled along with three different layers in a TBC system, namely, the Top Coat (TC), the Bond Coat (BC) and the Thermally Grown Oxide (TGO). The TC/TGO and the TGO/BC interfaces are assumed to be sinusoidal of specified amplitude and frequency extracted from experimental observations reported in the literature. To simulate fracture in the TBC, cohesive elements are inserted throughout the inter-element boundaries in order to enable arbitrary crack initiation and propagation. A bilinear traction-separation relation with specified fracture properties for each layer is used to model the constitutive behaviour of the cohesive elements. Parametric studies are conducted for various pore geometrical features, porosity, fracture properties of Top Coat layer and Thermally Grown Oxide layer thicknesses. The results are quantified in terms of crack initiation and evolution. It is found that the presence of pores has a beneficial effect on the fracture behavior up to a certain value of porosity after which the pores become detrimental to the overall performance. Insights derived from the numerical results can help in understanding the failure behavior of practical TBC systems and further aid in engineering the TBC microstructure for a desired fracture behavior.","Krishnasamy, Jayaprakash;Ponnusami, Sathiskumar A.;Turteltaub, Sergio;van der Zwaag, Sybrand",2019-11-30,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Concurrent multiscale model,Cohesive elements,Porosity,Fracture",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.031,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.031
"Structural, magnetic and Raman study of CoFe2O4@C core–shell nanoparticles","The synthesis of CoFe2O4@C core–shell nanoparticles (NPs) was performed using a two-step method, including reverse micelle and thermo-chemical vapor deposition (TCVD). The water to surfactant molar ratio (W) was selected as 8 and 10. The diameter and crystallite size of the as-prepared CoFe2O4 NPs were lower than 10nm. Acetylene gas (C2H2) was used as a carbon precursor and coating was performed for 1, 2, and 3h. After coating, the core size was below 30nm and the thickness of the shell was below 8nm. The composition, structure, and morphology of the fabricated NPs were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and selected area diffraction (SAD) pattern. The vibration sample magnetometer (VSM) was also used to investigate the magnetic properties. It was found that carbon shell has a significant effect on the growth and magnetic properties of the core NPs. To study the coated carbon, micro-Raman spectroscopy was used and it was approved that the deposited carbon consists of graphite, MWCNTs and diamond-like carbon (DLC). By increasing the coating time, the ratio of the amorphous peak intensity to the ordered peak intensity I D I G was decreased, causing to an enhancement in the crystalline size of graphite.","Bakhshi, Hamed;Shokuhfar, Ali;Afghahi, Seyyed Salman Seyyed",2015-11-30,Ceramics International,"Nanostructures,Precipitation,Chemical vapor deposition,Magnetic properties,Raman spectroscopy",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.05.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.05.009
Effect of Ti particle size on mechanical and tribological properties of TiCN coatings prepared by reactive plasma spraying,"Titanium carbonitride (TiCN) coatings were successfully fabricated by reactive plasma spraying (RPS) from agglomerated Ti-graphite feedstock. The effect of Ti particle size on the microstructure and phase composition of plasma sprayed TiCN coatings was investigated. The Vickers microhardness of coatings was measured by a Microhardness Test and the corresponding Weibull distribution were also analyzed. In addition, a pin-on-disk tribometer was employed to determine the trobological properties of coatings. Results show that all the coatings consist of TiC x N 1−x (0 ≤ x ≤1) and minor Ti2O phases, and the amount of Ti2O increases with the increase of Ti particle size. The Weibull distribution of Vickers microhardness of all the coatings shows apparent scattering, while the coating sprayed with Ti particle size of 28µm exhibits a relatively even distribution. Compared with the coating sprayed with Ti particle size of 14µm or 48µm, the coating sprayed with Ti particle size of 28µm exhibits improved mechanical and tribological properties, which are attributed to the high microhardness and strong bonding strength.","Qin, Yanfang;He, Jining;Yin, Fuxing;Liu, Baoxi;Zhang, Fanyong",2017-12-15,Ceramics International,"TiCN coatings,Reactive plasma spraying,Particle size,Mechanical properties,Tribological properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.041,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.041
Comparison of different fluorapatite dip coated layers on porous zirconia tapes,"Fluorapatite (FA) layers with different thickness and microstructures on porous 3mol% yttria-partially stabilized zirconia (Y-PSZ) substrates have been fabricated by dipping porous zirconia tapes into aqueous fluorapatite slurries. Porous ZrO2 tapes were developed using starch and an acrylic latex as fugitive additive and binder, respectively. Two different binders, poly(vinyl)alcohol (PVA) and latex were used to prepare the fluorapatite dip coating slips. The influence of the suspension properties and the porous structure of the tape surfaces (top and bottom) on the formation rate and consequently on the layer thickness formed on each surface were studied. In addition, the microstructure of the layers produced by using the different dip-coating slips were compared and the osteoblastic cellular response to the different FA coating layers was examined. A greater initial thickness of the layer adhered was found for the tapes dip coated in the FA slip with latex; for immersion times>0, the casting rate was observed to be strongly influenced by both the structure of the tape surfaces and the suspension properties. For both FA slurries, the casting rate at the top surface of the tapes was greater than that at the bottom surface. Sintered layers with thickness 8–9 times greater on both tape surfaces were found using the dip coating slip with latex. For each tape surface, the casting rate was accelerated and the layer shrink during sintering was reduced by using the dip coating slip with latex. The coating layer produced with latex enhanced the osteogenic potential of osteoblastic cells in vitro, which is ultimately an indication of the material׳s capacity to promote bone repair in vivo.","Albano, María P.;Garrido, Liliana B.;Teixeira, Lucas Novaes;Rosa, Adalberto Luiz;Tambasco de Oliveira, Paulo",2014-09-30,Ceramics International,"Porous ZrO2 tapesio,Fluorapatite layers,Dip coating,Osteoblastic cell response",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.03.166,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.03.166

The high-temperature erosion resistance of the coated CBCFs/ZrB2 was investigated under simulated atmospheric re-entry conditions by a high frequency plasma wind tunnel test with a heat fluxes of 1.3MW/m and stagnation pressure of 1.2kPa. The results showed that the coated composites exhibited excellent ablation resistance for 800s and the different positions of coating exhibit different response temperatures and microstructures. After ablation, the micrographs of marginal position show more compact than central position at sample surface. In addition, the side of the samples exhibits crack region, B2O3 precipitates region and virgin coating region.","Xu, Baosheng;Hong, Changqing;Zhou, Shanbao;Han, Jiecai;Zhang, Xinghong",2016-06-30,Ceramics International,"ZrB2,Erosion resistance,C/C composites,Coating,Oxidization",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.03.029,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.03.029
Chemical vapor deposition and composition–depth profiling of a graded coating by Auger electron spectroscopy used in conjunction with taper polishing,"A graded TiC x N1−x coating with x varying parabolically in the range 0–1 was grown by chemical vapor deposition in the TiCL4–CH4–N2–H2 system by quasi-continuously changing process parameters (growth time, CH4 mole fraction) at 1400K and at 10.7kPa. Taper polishing of the graded coating was carried out by a simple apparatus converting a depth dimension into a lateral dimension. Auger electron spectroscopy line scan was then performed on the taper polished surface. Composition profile of the graded coating was determined to be in agreement with the designed one using surface profilometer traces and AES signals from C KLL transition at 272eV.

Study of historical lead silicate glasses and their preservation by silica coating,"In the last years the interest for protection of the historical objects has increased. Among them a high number of ancient and middle age objects were made from lead silicate glasses. Such historical objects from glass contain small quantities (below 5wt%) of transitional elements as Cu, Ag, Fe, which decrease their resistance at weathering. Previous investigations show that protective sol–gel silica coating does not change the appearance of artistic alkali silicate glasses when it is deposited on their surface. In the present paper model lead silicate glasses with compositions similar to ancient objects were studied. Their chemical resistance in water, morphology and structure was investigated, being established that the iron added into glass changed the corrosion mechanism. In order to prevent the weathering of the synthesized glasses, a protective thin film was applied on surface. All glasses show a better resistance at water attack after coating with a film of silica gel.","Mocioiu, Oana Cătălina;Mocioiu, Ana-Maria;Marin, Alexandru;Zaharescu, Maria",2017-01-31,Ceramics International,"Historical lead silicate glasses,Resistance at water attack,Silica coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.09.055,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.09.055
Optical properties of ITO/AlO x thin films prepared by reactive d.c. magnetron sputtering,"ITO/AlO x films were deposited on PMMA by reactive d.c. magnetron sputtering. A transparent AlO x film was selected as a antireflective coating material in this investigation. The feasibility of using AlO x as an antireflective coating material for ITO films, and the influence of oxygen flow rate and bias voltage on the optical properties of AlO x films were studied. A dramatic increase in absorption was observed near a wavelength of 380 nm. The absorption of ITO/AlO x films increased initially with the bias voltage. However when the bias voltage exceed a critical value, the absorption decreased again. There was a close relationship between the content of Al and the IR absorption of ITO/AlO x films. The absorption in the infrared region of ITO/AlO x films increased with the oxygen flow rate and film thickness.","Lin, Su-Shia;Huang, Jow-Lay",2003-12-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Effect of Si content of CrSi-based coatings on their oxidation resistance in high temperature air,"Coating of zirconium-based substrates is a promising method to obtain accident-tolerant fuel claddings for light water reactors. In this study, CrSi-based coatings with varying Si content were deposited by multi-arc ion plating, and the effect of Si content on the oxidation behavior of the coatings in air at various temperatures (maximum 1160 °C) was investigated. The solid solution phase, formed by Si in CrSi coating, was seen to improve the oxidation performance of Cr. The nanocomposite structure in CrSiN coating can further improve the oxidation and stability of CrN. The results indicated that Si in CrSi-based coatings plays an effective role in the oxidation resistance of Zircaloy at high temperatures. Thus, these coatings could be used as potential accident tolerant fuel cladding materials for light water reactor applications.","He, Xiujie;Zhan, Hanyu;Lin, Jian;Liang, Gengyu;Yang, Shengzhi;Meng, Chuiyi;Ma, Xianfeng;Tan, Jie;Liu, Min",2020-06-01,Ceramics International,"CrSi,Coating,Accident-tolerant fuel,Oxidation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.165,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.165
Chemical synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles and their inclusion in Ni–P electroless coatings,"The work addresses the preparation of Ni3P3TiO2 nanocomposite coatings on mild steel substrate by the electroless technique. Nanosized TiO2 particles were first synthesized by the precipitation method and then were codeposited (4g/l) into the Ni3P matrix using alkaline hypophosphite reduced EL bath. The surface morphology, particle size, elemental composition and phase analysis of as-synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles and the coatings were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive analysis of X-ray (EDAX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Coatings with 20µm thickness were heat treated at 400°C for 1h in argon atmosphere. The morphology, microhardness, wear resistance and friction coefficient characteristics (ball on disc) of electroless Ni3P3TiO2 nanocomposite coatings were determined and compared with Ni3P coatings. The results show that as-synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles are spherical in shape with a size of about12nm. After heat treatment, the microhardness and wear resistance of the coatings are improved significantly. Superior microhardness and wear resistance are observed for Ni3P3TiO2 nanocomposite coatings over Ni3P coatings.","Makkar, Preeti;Agarwala, R.C.;Agarwala, Vijaya",2013-12-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Stable crack propagation in free standing thermal sprayed Al2O3 and Al2O3 ZrO2 TiO2 coatings,"Due to their unique properties and structure, thermally sprayed ceramics are applied in many fields. Their applications range from engineering ceramics to the use in high temperature units, especially since an improved thermal shock performance was observed. The present study presents an analysis of structural and mechanical properties of thermal sprayed alumina-rich coatings at room temperature. Microstructure and phase composition were analysed by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. For pure alumina material, high temperature X-ray diffraction was performed additionally and yielded a phase transition within heating to 1200 °C. Micrographs present typically layered and chaotic microstructure, streaked by microcracks. Cyclic loading test-procedures and the resulting load-displacement-curves revealed a pronounced R-curve-behaviour for coatings of pure Al2O3 and Al2O3 ZrO2 TiO2 compositions.","Neumann, Marc;Gehre, Patrick;Kuebler, Jakob;Dadivanyan, Natalia;Jelitto, Hans;Schneider, Gerold A.;Aneziris, Christos G.",2019-05-31,Ceramics International,"Thermal spraying,R-Curve-behaviour,Microcracking,Alumina,Titania,Zirconia",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.200,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.200
"Physical, mechanical, and thermal properties improvement of porous alumina substrate through dip-coating and re-sintering procedures","Dip-coating and re-sintering procedures were employed to improve the properties of porous alumina substrate produced through sponge replication technique. The sintering process induced defects to the porous substrate. Therefore, it was dip-coated with catalyst materials (SiC, Cr, and Ni) solutions and then re-sintered at 900–1250°C in vacuum furnace. The oxidation of catalyst materials was not detected after re-sintering process. The porosity of plain substrate (90.2%) was significantly reduced (85.3–88.7%) after multiple dip-coating cycles and re-sintering process, mainly due to closed cells and healed defects. The bulk and flaky morphologies of SiC and Cr powders increased the tendency for clogged cell, whilst the fine size additive materials heal defects through liquid phase sintering (LPS) mechanism. This prompted increment of thermal conductivity for the dip-coated substrate from 0.344W/mK for plain substrate to 1.064W/mK. The compressive strength for the once coated substrate was higher compared to the tri-coated substrate. The catalyst-based coatings are important for better physical, mechanical, and thermal conductivity of porous alumina and found beneficial especially in high temperature applications.","Jamaludin, Abdul Rashid;Kasim, Shah Rizal;Abdullah, Mohd Zukifly;Ahmad, Zainal Arifin",2016-05-01,Ceramics International,"Sintering (A),Defects (B),Mechanical properties (B),Al2O3 (D)",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.01.186,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.01.186
Exploration of YPO4 as a potential environmental barrier coating,"A non-silicate material, yttrium phosphate (YPO4), is developed for the application as environmental barrier coatings. The key issues of environmental durability, phase stability, chemical compatibility, and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) are considered for the selection of YPO4. The water corrosion behaviors for the sol–gel prepared YPO4 were investigated in an atmosphere of 50% H2O–50% O2 water vapor at 1350°C. The hot corrosion study of YPO4 was carried out at 900°C with Na2SO4 melt. The results demonstrate that YPO4 has excellent environmental durability. During these tests, YPO4 had no phase change and decomposition. Moreover, the reactions between YPO4 and silica at high temperatures were not detected, indicating the good chemical compatibility of YPO4. The measured CTE of YPO4 is close to that of SiC. The suitable CTE, good environmental durability and chemical compatibility, and excellent phase stability of YPO4 indicate that it is a potential environmental barrier coating material.","Wang, Yiguang;Chen, Xianhong;Liu, Wen;Cheng, Laifei;Zhang, Litong",2010-03-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Structural properties of the red-color overglaze for the HIZEN porcelains produced in the early Edo period of Japan,"HIZEN porcelains made in 1650s to 1750s (early Edo period) in Arita areas sited in south Japan (SAGA) are famous Japanese porcelains, which are characterized by elegant and bright colors in the overglaze and the underglaze. Red-overglazes and transparent glazes of the HIZEN porcelains have been investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) using synchrotron radiation. The results suggest that the red-color brightness of the Hizen porcelains is mainly induced by micro-structural correlation between α-Fe2O3 fine particles of red-color emission element and the oxide complexes of SiO2–Al2O3–CaO–KNaO or SiO2 in the fritted overglazes. The stability of the red-color overglaze on the porcelain body of white-color results from interfacial fusion between both glass-states in the fritted overglaze and the transparent glaze coating the porcelain body. The refined local structures around Fe ions of the α-Fe2O3 structure taken EXAFS spectra give the technical and historical relation among four kinds of the HIZEN porcelains for fritted materials of the overglazes and thermal treatment at high-temperature in the porcelain kilns.","Hidaka, M.;Ohashi, K.;Kajihara, S.;Wijesundera, R.P.;Kumara, L.S.R.;Choi, Jae-Young;Sung, Nark Eon",2009-03-31,Ceramics International,"HIZEN porcelains,Red-overglaze enamels,Kokutani,Kakiemon,Nabeshima ware",10.1016/j.ceramint.2008.03.017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2008.03.017
Comprehensive tribological study of optimized N-DLC/DLC coatings fabricated by active screen DC-pulsed PACVD technique,"The conventional DC-pulsed PACVD method was applied to deposit DLC and N-DLC coatings on AISI H13 substrate. ased on the optimized parameters achieved for single layer, N-DLC/DLC double layer coatings were deposited using two different techniques, namely: conventional and active screen. Chemical bindings and structural evolutions of double-layer coatings were investigated by visible Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). Accordingly, the friction coefficient of the active screen N-DLC/DLC coating at the end of the wear test was obtained about the value of 0.12 which was found to be the lowest among all samples.","Sharifahmadian, Omid;Mahboubi, Farzad",2019-09-30,Ceramics International,"PACVD,Nitrogen,Active screen,Double-layer",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.173,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.173
Preparation and characterization of ZrO2/Y2O3/Al2O3-based microstructured multilayer sol–gel coatings,"In this work several microstructured multilayer coatings with improved surface properties based on ZrO2/Y2O3/Al2O3 systems were produced and characterized through a suitable combination of the sol-gel method with dip-coating, studying the influence of the Al2O3 load (0–20%) on the coating characteristics. It was found that even at high alumina percentages, transparent, stable and suitable sols were obtained as a result of an optimized preparation method developed by our group. Sols sintetized allowed the preparation of high quality ZrO2/Y2O3/Al2O3-based microstructured multilayer sol–gel coatings. A noteworthy rise of Guglielmi and Zenezini´s adimensional flow parameter (J) was observed by increasing the Al2O3 load, suggesting that the quantity of material deposited onto a substrate was also increased. This result also corroborates a slight increase of films thicknesses after heat treatments. In addition, an increase on the coatings porosity was revealed by increasing the alumina content that could probably affect the final properties of protective coatings.","Carrasco-Amador, Juan Pablo;Diaz-Parralejo, Antonio;Macías-García, Antonio;Díaz-Díez, M.

A dense structure Si-SiC coating for oxidation and ablation protection of graphite fabricated by impregnation-pyrolysis and gaseous silicon infiltration,"A dense structure and well-bonded Si-SiC coating was fabricated by impregnation-pyrolysis combined with gaseous silicon infiltration to protect graphite materials from oxidation and ablation. The phase synthesis, microstructure, anti-oxidation and anti-ablation properties of the obtained Si-SiC coating were studied. Results indicated that the Si-SiC coating was defect-free, and SiC particles were surrounded by residual silicon.

The coated sample presented good ablation resistance performance, after ablation for 90 s, the mass and linear ablation rates of Si-SiC coated sample were 0.13 mg/s and 0.02 µm/s, respectively. Thermal physical and chemical erosion along with thermos-mechanical denudation of the Si-SiC coating are responsible for the ablation behaviors of the Si-SiC coating.","Jiang, Yan;Ru, Hongqiang;Ye, Chaochao;Wang, Wei;Zhang, Cuiping;Su, Xiaotong",2018-10-01,Ceramics International,"Graphite,Si-SiC Coating,Oxidation resistance,Ablation resistance,Gaseous silicon infiltration",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.201,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.201
Effect of nano-scale texture pretreatment on wear resistance of WC/Co tools with/without TiAlN coated flank-face in dry turning of green Al2O3 ceramics,"Advanced ceramics after sintering are almost processed by grinding or non-traditional machining. Nevertheless, these methods are limited by complexity of processing efficiency, tool wear and economic effectiveness. So machining green ceramics before sintering is introduced, it is environmentally friendly, efficient and cheap with high removal rate of materials. During dry turning green ceramics, flank-wear of tools and processing quality of compacts are two main elements to evaluate cutting performance of tools. The processing efficiency and economic effectiveness are mainly effected by the cutting performance of tools. In this paper, polished tool, tool with nano-scale textured flank-face, tool with TiAlN coating deposited on polished flank-face, and tool with TiAlN coating deposited on nano-scale textured flank-face were prepared. Effect of nano-scale texture pretreatment on wear-resistance of WC/Co tools with/without TiAlN coated flank-face was studied in turning of green Al2O3 ceramics. Results displayed that nano-scale textures on the flank-face had prominent effects on the enhancement of flank-wear resistance of tools. Relevant mechanisms were explored that nano-scale textures exhibited “derivative cutting” to protect unworn face from abrasion, and nano-scale textures pretreated on the flank-face could enhance the adhesion strength between coating and matrix. These developed tools could also significantly improve the processing quality of machined surfaces.","Liu, Yayun;Deng, Jianxin;Liu, Lili;Wang, Wei;Meng, Rong;Duan, Ran;Ge, Dongliang;Li, Xuemu",2018-12-01,Ceramics International,"Processing efficiency,Nano-scale texture pretreatment,Green Al2O3 ceramics,Adhesion strength,Flank-wear resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.163,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.163
Enhanced conductance properties of UV laser/RTA annealed Al-doped ZnO thin films,"Thin films comprising 0.5mol% aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) were prepared on glass substrates by a spin-coating method for transparent conducting oxide (TCO) applications. UV laser was selected for the annealing of AZO thin films, due to the well matched energy bandgap between UV laser and AZO films. After the rapid thermal annealing (RTA) process, post UV laser annealing was carried out by varying the scan speed of the laser beam, and the effects of laser annealing on the structural, morphological, electrical, and optical properties were analyzed. The results indicated that UV laser annealing based on various scan speeds affects the microstructure, sheet resistance, and optical transmittance of the AZO thin films, compared with those of the only RTA processed thin films. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed that all films that preferentially grew normally on the substrate had a (002) peak. The optical transmittance spectra of the laser/RTA annealed AZO thin films exhibited greater than 83% transmittance in the visible region. Also, the sheet resistance (1.61kΩ/sq) indicated that optimized UV laser annealing after the RTA process improves film conductance.","Kim, Jinhwan;Ji, Jae-Hoon;Min, Sung-Wook;Jo, Gae-Hun;Jung, Min-Woo;Park, Min-Jae;Lee, Sang-Kwon;Koh, Jung-Hyuk",2017-03-31,Ceramics International,"Sol–gel processes,Films,Electrical properties,Optical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.063,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.063
Strontium doped hydroxyapatite biomimetic coatings on Ti6Al4V plates,"Titanium (Ti) and its alloys are the most attractive metallic biomaterials since their first introduction to the biomedical area. Their major drawback is that they do not promote complete osteointegration due to their low bioactivity; thus, it is necessary to perform a surface treatment or apply a surface coating to increase the initial formation of surrounding bone tissue. In this study, strontium (Sr)-doped hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings on Ti6Al4V substrates were prepared by biomimetic method in which 2 times concentrated simulated body fluid (2×SBF) solution was used as the apatite growth medium. The characterization studies with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that as the amount of strontium ion (Sr2+) replacing with calcium ion (Ca2+) in the structure increases, crystallinity decreases without causing a significant change in morphology of the HA deposits. Incorporation of Sr2+ ions resulted in the disappearance of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) bands of carbonate ion (CO3 2-) which was found in the structure of pure HA biomimetic coating. The biological results demonstrated that Sr-doped HAs presented no cytotoxicity on Saos-2 cells. This study showed that the incorporation of Sr into apatitic structure is possible by mimicking the natural route and this procedure yields a promising bioactive coating on Ti alloys to be used in bone replacement therapies especially associated with osteoporosis.","Avci, Muhammed;Yilmaz, Bengi;Tezcaner, Aysen;Evis, Zafer",2017-08-15,Ceramics International,"Biomedical applications,Apatite,Surfaces,Ion doping,Selenium,Ti alloy",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.117,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.117
Facile synthesis of thin coating C/ZnO composites with strong electromagnetic wave absorption,"C/ZnO composites with increased electromagnetic (EM) wave absorbing features have been synthesized through a simple one-pot hydrothermal process and subsequent high temperature carbonization under the protection of argon. The results depict that the maximum absorption of C/ZnO composites synthesized with the optimal molar ratio of zinc acetate to glucose is −50.43 dB at 15.77 GHz. The 1.16-mm-thick coating shows a wide effective absorption bandwidth (3.52 GHz) of EM wave (RL≤−10 dB). The thin coating thickness of the C/ZnO composites is desirable for decreasing the absorber weight in EM wave absorption. And there are no other reagents used throughout the synthesis process except for the green glucose and zinc acetate. Thus, C/ZnO composites would be highly promising lightweight EM wave absorbing materials.","Wei, Dongchao;Qi, Yujie;Lv, Senhao;Shi, Guimei;Dai, Yuxiang;Qi, Yang",2019-03-31,Ceramics International,"Carbon (D),ZnO (D),Composites (B),Electromagnetic wave absorption properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.123,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.123
Thermal conductivity and expansion coefficient of Ln2LaTaO7 (Ln=Er and Yb) oxides for thermal barrier coating applications,"Two kinds of novel Ln2LaTaO7 (Ln=Er and Yb) ceramics were prepared via high-temperature solid reaction method. The phase composition, micro-morphology and thermophysical properties were investigated. Results indicate that pure Ln2LaTaO7 ceramics with single fluorite-type structure are synthesized successfully. The thermal conductivities of Er2LaTaO7 and Yb2LaTaO7 are in the range of 1.22–1.43W/mK and 1.17–1.51W/mK, respectively, which are much lower than that of YSZ. The lower thermal conductivity can be attributed to the phonon scattering caused by oxygen vacancies and the substituting atoms. The average thermal expansion coefficients of Yb2LaTaO7 and Er2LaTaO7 are 9.94×10−6/K and 9.63×10−6/K, respectively. As compared with Yb2LaTaO7, the higher thermal expansion coefficient of Er2LaTaO7 can be ascribed to its lower ionic-bond strength between cations at sites A and B.","Xiaoge, Chen;An, Tang;Hongsong, Zhang;Yanxu, Liu;Haoming, Zhang;Yongde, Zhao",2016-09-30,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Fluorite-type ceramics,Thermal conductivity,Thermal expansion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.141,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.141
Study on interfacial interaction between Si and ZnO,"The interfacial reaction and bonding mechanism of Si based undoped and Al-doped ZnO films were investigated experimentally and numerically. Si/ZnO heterojunctions were fabricated onto p-Si(100) wafers by RF magnetron sputtering, then the undoped and Al doped ZnO (AZO) films coated Si substrates were annealed in argon atmosphere (ZnO-Ar and AZO-Ar) and air atmosphere (ZnO-Air and AZO-Air) respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) show the prepared Si-based films have wurtzite structure with (002) preferential growth, and demonstrate several Si oxides exist in both cases. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) finds that oxygen vacancies exist in ZnO-Ar, moreover, the stoichiometry between Zn and O in AZO-Ar film to be close to 1:1, and high oxygen content in ZnO-Air, which are also supported by Hall measurement. Furthermore, the Si 2p of XPS spectrum shows the width of interfacial interaction between Si and ZnO become weaker with the order of ZnO-Ar, AZO-Ar and ZnO-Air. To elucidate the joining and bonding mechanism between Si substrate and ZnO coating layer, molecular dynamics and first principle simulations were performed in this work, the simulation results show certain interstitial Si atoms coming from Si substrate interact with O atoms related to the Zn–O bonding at the Si/ZnO interface, and resulting in oxygen vacancies in ZnO film. The experiment and simulation show the interfacial interaction between Si and ZnO depends on oxygen content coming from ZnO coating layer, the limited oxygen coming from ZnO film could increase the width of Si/ZnO interfacial interaction and leave oxygen vacancies in ZnO film due to Si robbing O atoms related to Zn–O bonding.","Liu, Zhixiang;Tang, Yunqing;Liao, Ningbo;Yang, Ping",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Interfacial reaction,Si/ZnO heterojunctions,Molecular dynamics,First principle",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.200,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.200
Efficient one-step fabrication of superhydrophobic nano-TiO2/TMPSi ceramic composite coating with enhanced corrosion resistance on 316L,"TiO2 Nanoparticle/Trimethoxy(propyl)silane (TMPSi) ceramic composite coating was deposited on 316L steel using a one-step electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method. Silane coupling agent (TMPSi) was added to the EPD bath in different concentrations (from 0.5 to 15 vol %) to decrease the surface energy of the deposited coating. TiO2 coating is hydrophilic whereas by adding varying concentrations of TMPSi, the obtained nanocomposite coating showed much better hydrophobicity. Surface wettability was measured by water contact angle (WCA) and sliding angle (SA) tests. Moreover, the effect of TMPSi concentration was determined by comparing the WCA and SA values. Surface morphology was studied through Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), and the presence of micro/nano meter roughness on the surface was confirmed. The distribution of elements were investigated by EDS analysis in which their uniform dispersion was observed. Corrosion behavior of 316L samples before and after the coating process was studied by potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests in 3.5 wt % NaCl solution. The polarization curve proved that the superhydrophobic ceramic nanocomposite coatings (WCA = 168° and SA = 3.1°) were able to decrease the corrosion rate of bare 316L (from 12.180 to 5.621 (μm per year)).","Emarati, Seyed Masoud;Mozammel, Mahdi",2020-02-01,Ceramics International,"Superhydrophobic,Composite,EPD,TiO2,Corrosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.137,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.137

Moreover, the LTO-TO/C electrode showed excellent cycle performance, with a discharge capacity of 121.3mAhg−1 remained after 300 cycles at 5 C, corresponding to an average capacity degradation rate of 0.073% per cycle.

A scalable strategy to synthesize TiO2-V2O5 nanorods as high performance cathode for lithium ion batteries from VOx quasi-aerogel and tetrabutyl titanate,"A nano-porous VOx quasi-aerogel composed of VOx nanofibers (VOx NFs) is synthesized through facile sol-gel process, solvent exchange and subsequent vacuum drying. After grinding and annealing, VOx quasi-aerogel is converted into well-crystallized V2O5 nanorods (V2O5 NRs) which can be used as a promising cathode material with high capacity for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Besides, TiO2 coated V2O5 nanorods (TiO2-V2O5 NRs) are obtained by a simple hydrolysis reaction of tetrabutyl titanate under wet-chemistry condition and followed by post-sintering in air. Electrochemical measurements indicate that TiO2-V2O5 NRs as cathode material for LIBs exhibit more stable cycling performance (highest specific capacity is 261.6mAhg−1 and 223.0mAhg−1 after 50 cycles at 100mAg−1 between 2 and 4V vs. Li/Li+) and better rate capability (exhibiting 155.8mAhg−1 under 800mAg−1) compared with unmodified V2O5 NRs (highest capacity is 269.7mAhg−1 and 212.7mAhg−1 for the 50th cycle at 100mAg−1; delivering 112.2mAhg−1 under 800mAg−1). The improved performance could be attributed to the protective effect of TiO2 coating layer between active V2O5 NRs and electrolyte. This work provides a facile and scalable route to synthesize high-performance nano-structured V2O5 cathode and its surface-modified counterpart for LIBs application.","Zhou, Xiaowei;Chen, Xu;Bi, Qinsong;Luo, Xiaobin;Sun, Li;Liu, Zhu",2017-10-15,Ceramics International,"Sol-gel method,VOx quasi-aerogel,V2O5 nanorods,Hydrolysis,Lithium ion batteries",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.152,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.152
A novel synthesis method of nanostructured MgO-coated hollow carbon nanofibers via CO decomposition over Mg/MgO catalyst,"An easy and one-step synthesis method for preparation of oxide-coated carbon nanofibers (CNFs) by Mg/MgO catalyst has been reported. For this purpose, the mixture of Mg (metal) and MgO (fused magnesia) powders were heat treated at 1000°C under reducing atmosphere of CO gas and the final product was comprehensively characterized by various analytical methods such as X-ray diffractometry, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transition electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy. The results showed the formation of hollow CNFs with the average diameter and wall thickness of 100nm and 25nm, respectively. Furthermore, SEM micrographs have obviously revealed the presence of highly packed MgO nanoparticles (with average particle size of 30nm) on the outer surface of fibers owing to catalytic reaction of Mg (v) and CO gasses. Considering the superior physical properties of the synthesized oxide-coated material such as great packing, high uniformity as well as the absence of structural defects, oxide-coated CNFs showed considerable enhancement in the oxidation resistance compared to the conventional carbon nanofibers. The synthesized oxide coated CNFs showed a weight loss of less than 5wt% after exposing to high temperature at oxidative atmosphere highlighting the significant effect of the oxide coating. This effect was confirmed by a thermoanalytical technique using differential scanning calorimeter equipped with the online gas analyzer.","Najafi, Abolhassan",2017-08-15,Ceramics International,"Synthesis,Coating,Carbon nanofibers,Magnesium oxide,Catalyst,Microstructure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.076,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.076
CMAS penetration-induced cracking behavior in the ceramic top coat of APS TBCs,"The penetration of calcium-magnesium-alumino-silicate (CMAS) is one of the most vital factors inducing the failure of air plasma sprayed thermal barrier coatings (APS TBCs). In present study, a two-dimensional periodical model considering the microstructures in ceramic top coat (TC) is built to study the cracking behavior in the TC of APS TBCs penetrated by CMAS during the cooling process. The CMAS penetration process is considered by filling the microstructures with the same shape of CMAS. The results show that CMAS penetration into the microstructures of the TC changed the stress distribution around the microstructures and induced a mixed crack type here. A microstructure with a relatively sharper geometry will experience a more severe stress state when penetrated by CMAS. The material discontinuity due to CMAS penetration also causes a slightly higher stress level around the microstructure at the CMAS deposit/TC interface, the CMAS penetrated layer and TC/BC interface. Thus, the horizontal cracks are easier to initiate from the microstructures with sharper geometry in these three regions.","Cai, Zhenwei;Jiang, Jishen;Wang, Weizhe;Liu, Yingzheng;Cao, Zhaomin",2019-08-01,Ceramics International,"CMAS penetrated APS TBCs,Cracking behavior in TC,CMAS penetration depth,Microstructure shape,Horizontal cracks",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.152,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.152
Microstructure and high temperature anti-ablation behavior of Cr-modified ZrC coating for SiC-coated carbon/carbon composites,"To further the anti-ablation property of carbon/carbon composites (C/Cs) at extreme-high temperature, Cr-ZrC coating is fabricated on SiC-coated C/Cs. The anti-ablation properties of the ZrC coatings modified by various content of Cr are tested by oxyacetylene flame (heat flux: 2.4 MW/m2). Compared with pure ZrC coating, the ablation resistance property of the sprayed Cr-ZrC coating indicates an effective improvement. Cr acts as an accelerant by facilitating the liquid ZrO2 sintering and form a close structure. This dense structure can alleviate oxygen penetration. As the content of Cr increase (10 wt%, 15 wt% and 20 wt%), after cooling can also detect the retaining of tetragonal-ZrO2 (t-ZrO2). The phase transformation from t-ZrO2 to monoclinic ZrO2 (m-ZrO2) can lead to the volume expansion. The retaining of t-ZrO2 shows the phase transformation is impeded, which contributes to the thermal stability of the Cr modified ZrC coating. In the specimen, oxygen mainly diffuse through micropores, microcracks and grain boundaries. For Cr-ZrC coating, these diffuse ways could be partly or completely sealed by melted Zr-O-Cr coating during ablation test, which can effectively protect C/Cs during the oxyacetylene ablation test. When the content of Cr is 15 wt%, on the surface can form dense dendritic structure, which can effectively protect C/Cs from ablation.","Huo, Caixia;Guo, Lingjun;Wang, Changcong;Zhou, Lei;Wang, Jiancheng;Li, Kaijiao",2019-02-01,Ceramics International,"Carbon/carbon composites,Chromium-zirconium carbide,Composite coating,Supersonic atmosphere plasma spraying,Ablation resistance property",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.063,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.063
"A holistic analysis of surface, chemical bonding states and mechanical properties of sol-gel synthesized CoZn-oxide coatings complemented by finite element modeling","This article presents a comprehensive study on surface chemical bonding states, morphological features, mechanical properties, finite element modeling, and water contact angle measurements of wet chemical based dip-coated CoZn-oxide thin film coatings. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Nanoindentation, finite element method (FEM) modeling, and drop shape analysis techniques were used to carry out the detailed measurements. AFM studies showed that the surface roughness values of all the coatings sturdily increased with the increase in sol concentrations. The gradual increase in sol concentrations and annealing temperature also had a remarkable influence over the Co, and Zn-contents of these coatings given by XPS analysis. The deconvolution of Co 2p 3/2 photoelectron lines revealed the formation of Co(OH)2, CoO, Co2O3, and Co3O4 phases from the coatings surface while low intensity satellite peaks developed due to a partial spinel lattice structure of Co-ions. The occurrence of Co3O4, CoO, and ZnO phases were also confirmed from the deconvolution of O 1s photoelectron lines. The elastic modulus, E, of CoZn-oxide thin film coating, varied within the range of 43.7–69.2 GPa was comparable with that in CoCuO thin film coatings. The maximum stress level induced was estimated to be in the range of 4.0–6.5 GPa. However, as the thickness of the coatings is increased, the maximum stress level slightly decreased. The coatings were moderately hydrophobic.","Rahman, M.

Synergistic effect of glass fibre and Al powder on the mechanical properties of glass-ceramics,"To explore the synergistic effect of glass fibre and Al powder on the mechanical properties of glass-ceramics, blast furnace slag was chosen as the main material, and glass fibre and Al powder as reinforcement materials. The phase compositions, microstructures, compressive properties, and apparent density of the glass-ceramics with varying quantities of glass fibre and Al powder were investigated. The experimental results indicated that Al powder could exist as a simple substance in glass-ceramics and form a dense net coating on the surface of blast furnace slag to improve the plasticity of the glass-ceramic. The glass fibre had better reinforcement effect than Al powder because of its extremely high mechanical strength. The plasticity of glass-ceramics, however, severely decreased; the glass-ceramics exhibited brittle failure during compression. A slight increase in the content of CaSi2 and SiO2 in the glass-ceramics was closely related to the addition of glass fibre. Considering safety and economy, glass-ceramics with 6% Al and 14% glass fibre (S4) have the best mechanical properties. The compressive strength, strain at maximum force, and apparent density were 40 MPa, 19% and 1.974 g/cm3, respectively.","Gao, H.T.;Liu, X.H.;Zhang, S.J.;Qi, J.L.",2018-09-30,Ceramics International,"Glass-ceramics,Glass fibre,Al powder,Mechanical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.155,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.155
Colour of Ca(Co x Mg1-x )Si2O6 pyroxenes and their technological behaviour as ceramic colorants,"Cobalt-based pigments were synthesized using clinopyroxene as crystalline host. The pigments are a Ca(Co x Mg1-x )Si2O6 solid solution, with x = 0.05, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8 Co apfu, and were synthesized from melt. The pigments were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, SEM-EDS, optical microscopy, colorimetry and optical spectroscopy. The pigments were then tested in glazes and glassy coatings for ceramic tiles to determine their colouring performance. The synthesized pigments showed a pink colour with different shades, due to the absorption of Co2+ in octahedral coordination. The colour disappeared in the Ca(Co0.05Mg0.95)Si2O6 pigment after grinding. The Ca(Co x Mg1-x )Si2O6 pigments partially dissolved in glazes, acting like dyes, and bestowed a blue shade on coatings, with a colour efficiency similar to industrially used blue colorants (cobalt aluminate spinel and cobalt olivine). In the glassy coatings, pigment dissolution occurred at a lower extent, and a colour intermediate between the pyroxenes and the pigment-bearing glazes was obtained. The Co content in pyroxene dyes is lower than conventional pigments, being down to 5%wt.","Gori, Claudia;Mantovani, Luciana;Tribaudino, Mario;Zanelli, Chiara;Dondi, Michele",2018-08-01,Ceramics International,"Cobalt leaching,Glaze,Pigment,Pyroxene",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.078,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.078
Structure analysis and formation mechanism of Ce doped Al2O3 coatings prepared by cathode plasma electrolytic deposition,"In the present study, CPED technology was used to prepare Ce doped Al2O3 coatings with different doping contents on 316 stainless steel substrates. The effects of the Ce contents, deposition voltages and heat treatment process on the phases and structures of the coatings were analyzed, and the formation mechanism during the CPED process was studied. The results showed that the Ce was existed in the forms of two states: solid solution state and oxide state (CeO2). The presence of the CeO2 resulted in a fine crystalline structure of the Al2O3 and compression stress in the Al2O3 coatings due to the thermal mismatch. Stress release and phase transitions from γ-Al2O3 to η-Al2O3, and α-Al2O3 occurred during the heat treatment process, and the doping of Ce by CPED method can effectively inhibit the phase transition to α-Al2O3. It was demonstrated that the pore sizes and the porosity of the coatings were related with the dielectric constants of the coatings, and high content of Ce had a negative effect on the porous structure.","Zhang, Shuguang;Zhang, Jin;Ji, Ruonan;Lian, Yong;He, Yedong",2018-08-15,Ceramics International,"Ce doped Al2O3,Phase and structure,Formation mechanism,Cathode plasma electrolytic deposition",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.060,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.060
Microstructural evolution of SiC coating on C/C composites exposed to 1500 °C in ambient air,"Oxidation-resistant coatings are essentially required to improve oxidation resistance performance of carbon/carbon (C/C) composites for applications under oxygen-containing atmosphere at elevated temperatures. In this work, thick and loose SiC coating was prepared by pack cementation (PC) to offer protection for C/C composites. Coating thickness, phases, anti-oxidation properties, and failure behavior at 1500 °C were characterized in ambient air for the as-prepared SiC coated specimens. As-prepared loose SiC coating with 150 µm thickness shows good oxidation resistance due to outstanding self-heal ability of SiO2. Weight loss of SiC coated specimens exposed to 1500 °C in ambient air is about 2.1% after oxidation for 58 h. Microstructural observation of SiC coated specimens after long-term oxidation indicates that bubbles caused by immigration and expansion of CO2 gas introduce defects. These defects cannot be rapidly healed by SiO2, which is main reason for SiC coating failure.","Zhou, Wei;Xiao, Peng;Luo, Wei;Li, Yang",2019-01-31,Ceramics International,"SiC,C/C,Oxidation,Failure,Bubbles",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.255,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.255
Structure and mechanical properties of hydroxyapatite coatings produced on titanium using plasma spraying with induction preheating,Coatings of hydroxyapatite (HAp) were prepared by plasma spraying with induction preheating of titanium substrate from 200 to 1000°C. The combination of conventional plasma spraying and induction preheating ensured high mechanical properties of HAp coatings. The coatings produced in the temperature range 400–600°C were characterized by homogeneous nanostructure of splats with an average grain size of 12–31nm.

Thermo-electrical properties of the alumina coatings deposited by different thermal spraying technologies,"Thermal and electrical properties of alumina (Al2O3) coatings produced via Atmospheric Plasma Spraying (APS) and Detonation Gun Spraying (DGS) were investigated and compared in this study. A combination of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, image analysis and X-ray Diffraction analysis (XRD) were used to better understand microstructural characteristics of as-sprayed alumina coatings. Microstructure formation of coating layers and its main features such as splats, pores, and boundaries were experimentally observed for both deposited coatings. The measurement of splats average thickness indicated that splat sizes, as building blocks of coatings were approximately similar for both coatings. The XRD showed that feedstock was pure α-Al2O3, but both deposited alumina coatings contained the mixture of α-Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3 phases. However, the amount of α-Al2O3 phase was two times higher in DGS deposited coating. The DGS deposited coatings were also had a higher hardness compared to APS deposited one. The electrical properties of alumina coatings were measured using the pseudo two-contact impedance spectroscopy method that allowed separation of the electrical resistivity of splats and their boundaries within the coating microstructure. The obtained results showed significant difference between these two features in terms of electrical resistivity, namely splats had 5 orders of magnitude smaller resistivity compared to the splat boundaries. In addition, DGS deposited coating was characterized with higher electrical resistivity of splats and splat boundaries compared with APS coating. Finally, the experimentally measured thermal conductivities of alumina coatings showed higher thermal conductivity in DGS deposited coatings compared to the APS ones. These values were validated using analytical models and Finite Element Analysis (FEA).","Shakhova, I.;Mironov, E.;Azarmi, F.;Safonov, A.",2017-12-01,Ceramics International,"Alumina coatings,Atmospheric plasma spraying (APS),Detonation gun spraying (DGS),Microstructural characterization,Electrical resistivity,Thermal conductivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.080,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.080
Effects of spray distance on the microstructure and mechanical properties of reactive plasma sprayed TiCN coatings,"The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of spray distance on the microstructure and mechanical properties of reactive plasma sprayed titanium carbonitride (TiCN) coatings under nitrogen plasma gas. For this purpose, five different distances were adopted, and the morphology (single splats, surface and cross section) and composition (phase and chemical) of as-sprayed coatings were investigated. Mechanical properties of bonding strength, hardness, elastic modulus as well as indentation toughness of coatings were systematically evaluated. Results show that all of coatings consist of TiC x N 1−x (0 ≤ x ≤ 1), TiO x , amorphous graphite and CN x phases, and the amount of ternary TiCN increases as the spray distance increases. Typical microstructure of plasma sprayed coatings containing fully melted particle, partially melted particles, un-melted particles and defects (pores and cracks) are observed. As the spray distance increase, the surface morphology and splats shape change from uneven and irregular ones to relatively flat and regular “disc splats” due to the improved dwell time and sufficient melting in plasma jet. In this case, the maximum hardness about 17.8 ± 1.9 GPa, elasticity modulus about 214.5 ± 18.3 GPa and bonding strength about 24.2 ± 2.1 MPa are obtained due to the relatively high TiCN content, favorable indentation toughness and compact microstructure. As the spray distance further increases to 150 mm, irregular “fingers splats” appear, and in this case the mechanical properties of coating are worsened. Therefore, a significant influence of spray distance on the microstructure and mechanical properties of as-sprayed TiCN coating is found.","Qin, Yanfang;Jiao, Qi;Zheng, Gaofeng;Zhang, Fanyong;He, Jining;Yin, Fuxing",2018-10-01,Ceramics International,"TiCN coatings,Reactive plasma spraying,Spray distance,Microstructure,Mechanical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.181,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.181
Structural changes of hydroxyapatite coating electrophoretically deposited on NiTi shape memory alloy,"The surface of the NiTi shape memory alloy was functionalized through the deposition of hydroxyapatite (HAp) coatings using the electrophoretic method (EPD). The electrophoresis carried out at the voltage of 40 V during the time of 120 s did not affect the crystalline structure of the initial HAp powder and, at the same time, ensured obtaining a homogeneous layer without visible cracks or discontinuities. Next, the coatings were subjected to heat treatment at 800 °C for 2 h in vacuum, wherein the applied conditions did not affect the decomposition of the deposited hydroxyapatite. The heat treatment resulted in the formation of carbonate apatite (C-HAp) in the HAp layer and in ceramic particles’ coalescence. Changes in the morphology and roughness of the layer as well as partial decomposition of the NiTi substrate parent phase into Ti2Ni and Ni4Ti3 phases were also observed.","Dudek, Karolina;Dulski, Mateusz;Goryczka, Tomasz;Gerle, Anna",2018-07-31,Ceramics International,"Hydroxyapatite (HAp),Carbonate hydroxyapatite (C-HAp),NiTi shape memory alloy (SMA),Surface modification,Electrophoretic deposition (EPD),Raman profilometry",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.175,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.175
Ultrathin CeO2 coating for improved cycling and rate performance of Ni-rich layered LiNi0.7Co0.2Mn0.1O2 cathode materials,"In this study, we have successfully coated the CeO2 nanoparticles (CeONPs) layer onto the surface of the Ni-rich layered LiNi0.7Co0.2Mn0.1O2 cathode materials by a wet chemical method, which can effectively improve the structural stability of electrode. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are used to determine the structure, morphology, elemental composition and electronic state of pristine and surface modified LiNi0.7Co0.2Mn0.1O2. The electrochemical testing indicates that the 0.3 mol% CeO2-coated LiNi0.7Co0.2Mn0.1O2 demonstrates excellent cycling capability and rate performance, the discharge specific capacity is 161.7 mA h g−1 with the capacity retention of 86.42% after 100 cycles at a current rate of 0.5 C, compared to 135.7 mA h g−1 and 70.64% for bare LiNi0.7Co0.2Mn0.1O2, respectively. Even at 5 C, the discharge specific capacity is still up to 137.1 mA h g−1 with the capacity retention of 69.0%, while the NCM only delivers 95.5 mA h g−1 with the capacity retention of 46.6%. The outstanding electrochemical performance is assigned to the excellent oxidation capacity of CeO2 which can oxidize Ni2+ to Ni3+ and Mn3+ to Mn4+ with the result that suppress the occurrence of Li+/Ni2+ mixing and phase transmission. Furthermore, CeO2 coating layer can protect the structure to avoid the occurrence of side reaction. The CeO2-coated composite with enhanced structural stability, cycling capability and rate performance is a promising cathode material candidate for lithium-ion battery.","Dong, Shengde;Zhou, Yuan;Hai, Chunxi;Zeng, Jinbo;Sun, Yanxia;Shen, Yue;Li, Xiang;Ren, Xiufeng;Qi, Guicai;Zhang, Xinxing;Ma, Luxiang",2019-01-31,Ceramics International,"Lithium-ion battery,Ni-rich layered LiNi0.7Co0.2Mn0.1O2,CeO2 coating,Cathode materials",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.145,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.145
Hot corrosion behavior of HVOF-sprayed Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo coating,"A novel binary carbide-based sprayed powder, consisting of hard phases (Cr3C2, WC) and matrix phase (NiCoCrMo), was designed to ensure the harsh environments (corrosion, wear, and high temperature) of power-plant boilers. A Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo coating was deposited by high-velocity oxygen-fuel (HVOF) process using an agglomerated and sintered Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo powder with a particle size of −45+15µm. Hot-corrosion tests were performed under cyclic conditions using a NaCl-KCl-Na2SO4 salt environment, at temperatures up to 500°C. High-temperature oxidation was performed at 500°C. For comparison, corrosion and oxidation tests were also performed on a commercial Cr3C2-25(NiCr) coating, and the corrosion resistance was evaluated by measuring the thickness of the corrosion scale. The properties of the specimens were characterized using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy. The Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo and Cr3C2-25(NiCr) coatings exhibited similar oxidation-resistance properties. The Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo coating exhibited superior corrosion resistance to that of the Cr3C2-25(NiCr) coating. In the case of the Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo coating, the thickness of the corrosion scale was approximately one-third that of the Cr3C2-25(NiCr) coating. The hot-corrosion resistance imparted by the Cr3C2-WC-NiCoCrMo coating may be attributed to the formation of alloy phases during the powder and coating manufacturing process, as well as to the formation of Cr, W, Ni, Co and Mo oxides, and Ni and Cr spinels.","Zhou, Wuxi;Zhou, Kesong;Deng, Chunming;Zeng, Keli;Li, Yuxi",2017-08-15,Ceramics International,"Cr3C2,WC,HVOF,Molten salts,Hot corrosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.109,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.109
A comprehensive mechanism for the sintering of plasma-sprayed nanostructured thermal barrier coatings,"Nanostructured thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are being widely researched for their superior thermal barrier effect and strain compliance. However, the sintering occurs inevitably in nanostructured TBCs that comprise both nanozones and lamellar zones, although the mechanism of sintering in such bimodal coatings is not yet clear. This study investigates the changes in microstructure and properties of nanostructured TBCs during thermal exposure with the aim to reveal the sintering mechanism operative in these coatings. Results show that the sintering process occurs in two stages. It was found that in the initial shorter stage (~0–10h), the properties increased rapidly; moreover, this change was anisotropic. The main structural change was the significant healing of the intersplat pores through multiconnection. During the subsequent longer stage, the change in the properties was much smaller, where it was observed that the pores continued to heal, albeit at a much lower rate. Furthermore, the faster densification of the nanozones induced during sintering became significant, resulting in an opening at the interface between the nanozones and the lamellar zones. In brief, the pore healing at the lamellar zones affects the properties, especially in the initial stage. The presence of nanozones has a positive effect in that the performance degradation during the overall thermal exposure is slowed down. An understanding of this competing sintering mechanism would enable the structural tailoring of nanostructured TBCs in order to increase their thermal insulation and thermal cycling lifetime.","Li, Guang-Rong;Yang, Guan-Jun;Li, Cheng-Xin;Li, Chang-Jiu",2017-09-30,Ceramics International,"Nanostructured coatings,Plasma-spraying,Thermal barrier coatings,Sintering,Two-stage kinetics",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.083,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.083
Influence of different chemical treatments on the surface of Al2O3/ZrO2 nanocomposites during biomimetic coating,"The objective of this study is to evaluate the influence of different chemical surface treatments (H3PO4, HNO3, and NaOH) in the formation of calcium phosphate phases on the surface of Al2O3/ZrO2 (5vol%) nanocomposite. For this purpose, Al2O3/ZrO2 samples were shaped, calcined at 400°C, sintered at 1500°C, subjected to different chemical treatments, and biomimetically coated from 14 to 21 days. Surface characterization was performed by scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, confocal microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and infrared spectroscopy. It was observed that the preliminary chemical treatment favored the formation of particular calcium phosphate phases of interest, such as α-TCP (alpha-tricalcium phosphate), β-TCP (beta-tricalcium phosphate), and HA (hydroxyapatite). The differences among the percentages of the phases formed affected the homogeneity of calcium phosphate distribution within the nanocomposites as well as the roughness of the formed layer, effectively contributing to adhesion, proliferation, and desired cell biofixation on bone implant.","dos Santos, Kátia Helena;Ferreira, Julieta Adriana;Osiro, Denise;da Conceição, Gelson José Andrade;Filho, Rubens Bernardes;Colnago, Luiz Alberto;de Jesus Agnolon Pallone, Eliria Maria",2017-04-01,Ceramics International,"Nanocomposites,Calcium phosphate,Chemical treatments,Biomimetic coating,Alumina-zirconia",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.069,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.069
Synthesis and characterization of hydroxyapatite/carboxylic acid functionalized MWCNTS composites and its triple layer coatings for biomedical applications,Introduction Achievement of bioactive coatings on metallic implant surface with higher adhesive strength and corrosive resistance was one of the main challenges for the current biomaterial researchers. Hydroxyapatite was one of the promising bioactive ceramic which can be applied as a coating on the metallic substrate due to its similarity with the human bone. Methods The work describes the in-situ preparation of HAP/f-MWCNTs composite by sol-gel method. MWCNTs were functionalized by acid treatment. HAP composites have been prepared by varying the molar percentage of f-MWCNTs from 1% to 5%. The prepared composites with various concentrations of f-MWCNTs were characterized by FT-IR and XRD for its functional group analysis and phase purity. The morphology of the prepared powder was analyzed using SEM and TEM. In-vitro corrosive behavior on SBF was studied for the coating prepared HAP composite sol on 316L SS. The triple layer composite coating was obtained at the spin speed of 3000 rpm/min and subjected to sintering at 500 °C/2 h. Results X-ray diffraction results confirmed the formation of pure HAP up to the addition of 3% of f-MWCNTs without any secondary phases. The average crystallite size of the prepared particles was decreased from 40 ± 2.1 to 17 ± 2.5 nm with the addition f-MWCNTs. The morphological studies confirm the incorporation of f-MWCNTs in HAP matrix. The prepared HAP/f-MWCNTs composite efficiently inhibits the growth of the pathogens such as S. Aureus and E.coli. Improved hardness was observed with reinforcement of f-MWCNTs into the hydroxyapatite matrix. Electrochemical studies confirm the HAP/f-MWCNTs composites having increased corrosive resistance properties.

Sintered and glazed glass-ceramics from natural and waste raw materials,"Monolithic sintered glass-ceramics and porous glass-ceramic components were produced from natural raw materials together with industrial waste. The waste, including fly ash from thermal power plants and metallurgical slags, either was mixed with natural raw materials (e.g., clay and silica sand) and vitrified or was directly sintered, after dry pressing at 40MPa. Fine powders of waste-derived glasses were also converted into sinter-crystallized glass-ceramics, after dry pressing at 40MPa and subjection of the pressed powders to controlled heating cycles, producing dense components with bending strength as high as ~80MPa. The two types of waste-derived materials, namely, ceramic tiles from direct sintering and sinter-crystallized glass-ceramics, were combined to obtain double-layered glass-ceramics. These featured a dense wear-resistant coating on a porous substrate and possessed mechanical properties that make them suitable, for example, as structural lightweight panels in building facades.","Binhussain, Mohammed A.;Marangoni, Mauro;Bernardo, Enrico;Colombo, Paolo",2014-03-31,Ceramics International,"D.

Improvement of thermal conductivity of carbonaceous matrix in monolithic Al2O3–C refractory composite by surface-modified graphites,"The thermal conductivity of the matrix part of alumina – carbon unshaped refractory has been estimated to accurately interpret its thermophysical and thermomechanical behavior. The properties of precalcined composite matrix containing either as-received or surface-modified graphite in equal quantity (20.0 wt%) have been investigated at three different temperatures (110,550,900 °C). The thermal compatibility or degradation of both kinds of carbonaceous matrices had been correlated with respective scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyses. The monolithic matrices were also subjected to X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies to distinguish between their phase evolution patterns. A synergestic study on an equivalent graphite-free formulation was also carried out. The thermal shock resistance profile of respective castables had been addressed to confirm the superiority of surface-treated graphites. Nanoengineering at graphite surface was conceived by Rietveld analysis of the (004) peak that substantiated the additional influence of calcium aluminate coating on selective clumping and partial exfoliation of graphite sheets.","Das, P.;Sinhamahapatra, S.;Dana, K.;Mukhopadhyay, S.",2020-12-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal conductivity,Al2O3,Carbon,Nanocoatings,Refractories,X-ray methods",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.090,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.090
Preparation and characterization of doped sol–gel zirconia films,"Highly oriented CeO2-, Y2O3- and MgO-doped ZrO2 thin films have been successfully prepared by a sol-gel process by dip-coating an ethanol solution of zirconium oxychloride octahydrate and the corresponding inorganic dopants. The doped ZrO2 films contain only the zirconia tetragonal phase and show nano-scale morphology. Under low load, doped ZrO2 films sliding against a AISI 52100 steel ball display a good wear and friction performance. Best results have been obtained with the 13 mol% CeO2- doped ZrO2 film, which exhibits a friction coefficient as low as 0.22 and a wear-life over 5000 sliding cycles under 1 N load.","Liu, Weimin;Chen, Yunxia;Ye, Chengfeng;Zhang, Pingyu",2002-12-31,Ceramics International,"Sol–gel,Doped zirconia thin films,Tribological performance",10.1016/S0272-8842(01)00101-8,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0272-8842(01)00101-8
Synthesis and characterization of NiO colloidal ink solution for printing components of solid oxide fuel cells anodes,"A synthesis of NiO colloidal ink solution for printing of the main anode component of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) by commercial printer was shown in the work. The ink was synthesized by a single step chemical reaction of the dissolved nickel nitrate hexahydrate and ammonium carbonate solution with the addition of Triton X-100 surfactant. Results revealed that the obtained ink was stable for at least 4 months contained almost the same NiO nanoparticles with the size at the range of 7–9 nm. These nanoparticles structural and morphology investigation was conducted by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), Raman spectroscopy and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) analytical methods. Detected rheological properties of the ink revealed that materials for anode in SOFC can be deposited using a commercial printer followed by calcination at 900 °C. Processes occurred during calcination were investigated by TGA and DSC analytical techniques. Finally, the printed coating was subjected to the investigation using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).","Sobolev, Alexander;Stein, Paz;Borodianskiy, Konstantin",2020-11-30,Ceramics International,"Powders: chemical preparation (A),Suspensions (A),Transition metal oxides (D),Fuel cells (E)",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.318,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.318
An integrative approach to coating/carbide substrate design of CVD and PVD coated cutting tools during the machining of austenitic stainless steel,"Machining of hard to cut materials such as austenitic stainless steel presents a challenge due the thermo-mechanical properties of this material, which contribute to intensive buildup edge formation and negatively affect tool life. CVD TiCN + Al2O3 and PVD AlTiN coatings deposited on cemented carbide substrates are generally recommended for machining austenitic stainless steel. These coatings were deposited by two different methods: (i) PVD AlTiN was deposited on the same substrate material at two different thicknesses (2.5 and 5 μm); (ii) CVD TiCN + Al2O3 was deposited with the same thickness (5 μm) on two different substrates. A new approach to applying various PVD and CVD (coating + substrate) integrated systems is introduced in this study for austenitic stainless steel machining. The relationship between the coating and substrate characteristics of these material systems and tool performance was assessed. The characteristics of the coating/carbide substrate design were evaluated in terms of chemical, phase composition, architecture, mechanical properties in relation to the tribological and wear performance. The obtained results demonstrate an improvement in tool wear performance and tool life brought about by the surface engineered layer/carbide material with an optimal combination of coating/substrate properties. Based on these findings, a guideline is proposed for further study of the cutting tool life and wear performance of CVD and PVD coated cemented carbide inserts.","He, Q.;Paiva, J.M.;Kohlscheen, J.;Beake, B.D.;Veldhuis, S.C.",2020-03-31,Ceramics International,"Integrative coating/carbide substrate,PVD and CVD coatings,Machining of SS304,Wear performance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.259,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.259
The adhesion and tribological properties of c-BN films deposited by high power impulse magnetron sputtering,"Nitride based films are very important for industrial applications due to their mechanical and tribological properties. Among the nitride based films, c-BN films have superior properties. But, the adhesion properties of c-BN films deposited using magnetron sputtering with different power sources are inadequate generally. Recently, High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS) power sources have been used to increase the adhesion of coatings and there is no open literature about c-BN deposited using HiPIMS. From this point, c-BN films were coated on 4140 steels using HiPIMS with closed-field unbalanced magnetron sputtering (CFUBMS). In the process, two B4C, two Ti targets and Ar+N2 gas mixture were used to synthesize c-BN films. The amount of N2 was altered as 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5sccm. The characteristic properties of c-BN films were analyzed using SEM, XRD and FT-IR. The mechanical properties were tested using a microhardness and scratch testers. The tribological properties were performed by a pin-on-disc tribotester under atmosphere, argon, and oil test conditions. The results showed that the properties of c-BN films deposited by HiPIMS are interesting. The hardness values were obtained above 36 GPa and the maximum critical load was reached to 80 N. Also, the minimum CoFs were observed as expected from the oil condition, in that case, the lowest CoF (μ ≅ 0.06) was noted from the hardest coating.","Efeoğlu, İhsan;Totık, Yaşar;Keleş, Ayşenur;Gülten, Gökhan;Ersoy, Kıvılcım;Durkaya, Göksel",2019-02-15,Ceramics International,"c-BN,HiPIMS,Adhesion,Friction",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.061,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.061
Influence of carbon sources on LiFePO4/C composites synthesized by the high-temperature high-energy ball milling method,"Carbon-coated LiFePO4 composites were synthesized by a new method of high-temperature high-energy ball milling (HTHEBM). Fe2O3 and LiH2PO4 were used as raw materials. Glucose, sucrose, citric acid and active carbon were used as reducing agents and carbon sources, respectively. In this method, high-energy ball milling and carbon coating worked together and, therefore, fine and homogeneous LiFePO4/C particles with excellent properties were obtained in a relatively short synthesis time of 9h. Moreover, the synthesis process could be completely finished at a relatively lower temperature of 600°C for high-energy ball milling transforming mechanical energy into thermal energy. The results of X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electrochemical performance tests indicated that carbon source had an important influence on the properties of LiFePO4/C composites synthesized by the HTHEBM method. It was proved that the LiFePO4 composites coated with glucose had the best properties with 1μm geometric mean diameter and 150.3mAhg−1 initial discharge capacity at a current rate of 0.1C. After the 20th cycle test, the reversible capacity was 148mAhg−1 at 0.1C, showing a retention ratio to the initial capacity of 98.5%.","Wang, Juan;Shao, Zhongbao;Ru, Hongqiang",2014-06-30,Ceramics International,"Lithium-ion batteries,Cathode material,LiFePO4,Carbon source,High-temperature high-energy ball milling method",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.12.025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.12.025
Preparation of a hydrophobic cerium oxide nanoparticle coating with polymer binder via a facile solution route,"In this work, cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized using a facile, low temperature solution process and coated using spin coating and spray coating approaches, for the fabrication of a hydrophobic surface coating. Silicon wafer (Si) substrates coated with CeO2 NPs exhibited excellent hydrophobic behavior, but poor adhesion of the NPs to the substrate was observed - likely due to the low surface polarity of CeO2 NPs. Polyacrylic acid (PAA) was introduced as an adhesion promoter to improve NP surface characteristics and obtain an adherent and cohesive coating. Slight polarity tuning and binder inclusion significantly enhanced the binding capability of the NPs as determined by peel-off measurements. The superior mechanical properties of NP coatings were attributed to the incorporation of PAA in the polymeric network. It improves inter-particle and particle-substrate secondary interactions, ultimately aiding NP cohesion and adhesion when deposited onto the Si substrate. The adhesive and hydrophobic properties of CeO2 NP coatings were maintained upon exposure to high temperatures, and the coatings are transparent as well, making them suitable for various applications, such as cookware, glass coating and technology components.","Yasmeen, Sumaira;Khan, Mohammad Rizwan;Park, Kiho;Cho, Yunshik;Choi, Jang Wook;Moon, Hyoung-Seok;Lee, Han-Bo-Ram",2020-06-01,Ceramics International,"CeO2 nanoparticles,Binder coating,Adhesion,Hydrophobicity,Spray coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.268,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.268
Microstructure and properties of 2D-Cf/SiC composite fabricated by combination of CVI and PIP process with SiC particle as inert fillers,"2D-Cf/SiC composite was manufactured by chemical vapor inflation (CVI) combined with polymer impregnation and pyrolysis (PIP) with SiC particle as inert fillers. The effects of CVI processes on SiC morphologies and the properties of composite were investigated. The composites were characterized by XRD, flexural strength test and SEM. The results revealed that uniform SiC coatings and nanowires were prepared when MTS/H2 ratio of 1:8 was employed, while gradient thick coatings were fabricated as MTS/H2 ratio of 1:1 was employed. The flexural strength of composites varied from 156MPa at MTS/H2 ratio of 1:1 to 233MPa at MTS/H2 ratio of 1:8. All of composites exhibited toughness due to significant debonding and pullout of fibers. The laminated structure of coatings on the fibers and nanowires were manufactured by combination of above different CVI process, and the obtained composites showed flexural strength of as high as 248MPa and impressive toughness.","Liang, Jianjun;Xiao, Hanning;Gao, Pengzhao;Guo, Wenming;Liu, Jingxiong",2017-02-01,Ceramics International,"Cf/SiC composite,CVI,PIP,SiC nanowires,Interfaces",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.134,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.134
Al2O3/FeAl interfacial behaviors by yttrium doping in high temperature oxidation,"FeAl coatings with yttrium (Y) doping were prepared at 600 °C on pure iron. The anti-flaking properties of Al2O3-oxide films at 1000 °C oxidation was improved significantly by Y doping in FeAl coatings. The spallation was 0.47 mg/cm2 for 200 h of oxidation and only ~1/6 of that without Y. The first principle calculation results demonstrate that the interfacial bond strength were enhanced with Y doping, that is because Y substituted primarily in the Al1 and Al2 position at the Al2O3/FeAl interfacial zone as the most negative interfacial cohesive energy of −13.94 eV and −12.72 eV. Remarkably, it is found that the maximum tensile strength of Y–FeAl/Al2O3 reaches to 20.48 GPa on uniaxial tensile strain, which is 1.33 times than that of FeAl/Al2O3 interface (15.36 GPa). Meanwhile, compared with a pure interface, Y doping would change ductile fracture on the Al2O3/FeAl interface as the strain was enhanced significantly by 49.12%. The bond length of the Al1–Y showed little change under external stress, which resulted in an increase in bonding strength of the Al2O3/FeAl interface and the inhibition of the generation and propagation of micro-cracks. The formation of a YAlO3 layer induced a release of thermal stress at the Al2O3/FeAl interface. Due to the improvement of interfacial strength, the enhancement of interfacial toughness and the formation of a YAlO3 stress-release layer between the Al2O3 film and FeAl coating, therefore, Y doping can significantly improve the anti-flaking performance of the Al2O3-oxide films in high temperature oxidation.","Rong, Ju;Wang, Xiao;Zhang, Yannan;Feng, Jing;Zhong, Yi;Yu, Xiaohua;Zhan, Zhaolin",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Al2O3-Oxide films,Y doping,High temperature oxidation,Al2O3/FeAl interfacial behavior,Stress release",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.253,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.253
Laser ablation behavior of flake graphite and SiO2 particle-filled hyperbranched polycarbosilane matrix composite coatings,"Composite coatings consisting of flake graphite and SiO2 fillers in a hyperbranched polycarbosilane (HBPCS) matrix were designed and prepared to meet the requirements of laser protection. The laser ablation behavior of the composite coatings were investigated. Control experiments were designed to study the performance of SiO2 during laser irradiation. The results show that the introduction of SiO2 changes the anti-laser protective mechanism and can improve the anti-laser property of the coating. High power laser irradiation results in pyrolysis of HBPCS and the formation of SiC particles. Chemical reactions between SiO2, graphite, and SiC play an important role in consuming energy, and provide an excellent cooling effect to the substrate, leading to decreased temperature. SiC particles formed on the surface of the laser ablation area act as a shield to prevent the laser from irradiating deeper layers of the coating. Due to the cooling effect and thermal stability of SiC, the proposed coating shows a good anti-laser property.","Ma, Chen;Ma, Zhuang;Gao, Lihong;Liu, Yanbo;Wu, Taotao;Zhu, Yongxiang;Wang, Fuchi",2018-12-01,Ceramics International,"Hyperbranched polycarbosilane,Composite coatings,Laser ablation behavior,Anti-laser property",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.192,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.192
Tribological and mechanical properties of Ti2AlC coating at room temperature and 800°C,"In order to study the characteristics of Ti2AlC coating using hypersonic flame spraying, Ti2AlC powder was synthesized and deposited on low carbon steel. The tribological and mechanical properties of Ti2AlC coating at room temperature and 800°C were investigated by frictional tests under different contact loads and sliding velocities. Stresses and crack generations of Ti2AlC coating were analyzed by finite element analysis. The phases at room temperature and 800°C were shown, and the reasons of low frictional coefficients were explained. Results show that Ti2AlC can be used as an excellent self-lubrication material at a wide range of temperature due to the special mix of metallic/covalent bonds and phase change performance. Contact loads and sliding velocities have significant effects on the frictional properties of Ti2AlC coating. As the buffer action of Ti2AlC coating, stress of substrate is decreased by 41.3%. The deformation of substrate is circular in nature and the crack is not easily generated due to the coating protection.","Cao, Jun;Yin, Zhongwei;Li, Hulin;Gao, Genyuan;Zhang, Xiuli",2018-01-31,Ceramics International,"Ti2AlC,Tribology,Coating,Phase change,Stress,Crack generation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.045,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.045
In-situ Cu-doped MnCo-spinel coatings for solid oxide cell interconnects processed by electrophoretic deposition,"The Cu doping of the Mn–Co spinel is obtained “in-situ” by electrophoretic co-deposition of CuO and Mn1.5Co1.5O4 powders and subsequent two-step reactive sintering. Cu-doped Mn1.5Co1.5O4 coatings on Crofer22APU processed by electrophoretic co-deposition method are tested in terms of long term oxidation resistance and area specific resistance tests up to 3600 h. The introduction of Cu in the spinel lead to higher level of densification of coatings for all the considered aging periods at 800 °C and stabilizes the cubic phase of the Mn1.5Co1.5O4 spinel. Corrosion rate of the Cu-doped Mn1.5Co1.5O4 coated Crofer22APU is ∼10x lower than for the uncoated Crofer22APU. The stabilization of the cubic phase due to Cu doping, which reduces the extent of the tetragonal-cubic phase transition and limits possible thermal stresses due to mismatch of coefficients of thermal expansion or volume changes, is reviewed and discussed by means of electrical conductivity measurements together with diffraction patterns and elemental analyses. These novel electrophoretic co-deposited Cu-doped MnCo spinel coatings represent an innovative approach to obtain coatings with higher density and have future applications in the view of reaching lower rates of Cr evaporation form the steel.","Sabato, A.G.;Molin, S.;Javed, H.;Zanchi, E.;Boccaccini, A.R.;Smeacetto, F.",2019-10-15,Ceramics International,"Coating,Spinel,EPD,Solid oxide cell",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.161,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.161
Effects of precursor concentration on the microstructure and properties of ZrC modified C/C composites prepared by precursor infiltration and pyrolysis,"To improve the ablation resistance of C/C composites, ZrC modified composites were fabricated by precursor infiltration and pyrolysis combined with gradient chemical vapor infiltration process. The effects of ZrC precursor concentration on the microstructure, mechanical and ablation properties of the composites were studied. Results showed that with the increase of ZrC precursor concentration, the ZrC content and macroscopic uniformity of the composites increased but with obvious ZrC particle aggregation and the flexural strength decreased gradually. As the concentration of ZrC precursor improved to 60%, the fracture mode of the composites transformed from toughness to brittleness which was mainly attributed to the improved graphitization degree and reaction damage of carbon fiber in the precursor pyrolysis process. However, the ablation resistance was enhanced with the increasing precursor concentration which was resulted from the formation of ZrO2 in center ablation region and continuous ZrO2 coating in brim region serving as a barrier to heat and oxygen transfer.","Xie, Jing;Li, Kezhi;Sun, Guodong;Li, Hui",2017-12-01,Ceramics International,"ZrC modified C/C composites,Microstructure,Mechanical property,Ablation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.177,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.177
Graphene nanosheet and carbon layer co-decorated Li4Ti5O12 as high-performance anode material for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries,"In this study, we report a facile strategy for anchoring Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) particles wrapped within carbon shells onto graphene nanosheet (GNS) using the freeze-drying assisted microwave irradiation method. In this designed structure, a conductive three-dimensional network can be formed by connecting the GNS and carbon layer which is benefit for the transport of electron and Li+-ion. When used as anode material for lithium-ion batteries, this hybrid composite exhibits an excellent high-rate performance with specific capacities of 171.5, 168.2, 160.1, 151.7 and 136.4mAhg−1 at various current rates of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20C, respectively. Furthermore, the specific capacity of the obtained anode still retains 99.6% of the initial value after 20 cycles at 20C. The enhanced battery performance can be attributed to the improved electronic conductivity of each LTO grain via uniform carbon coating and GNS wrapping. As a consequence, this novel strategy developed in this study may open a new way to fabricate other electrodes for advanced renewable energy conversion and storage applications.","Yang, Xujiao;Zheng, Anbo;Wang, Xianli;Niu, Boyu",2017-02-15,Ceramics International,"Anode material,Li4Ti5O12/C,Graphene,Electrochemical performance,Lithium-ion batteries",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.11.154,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.11.154
Comparative study on wear behavior of plasma sprayed Al2O3 coatings sliding against different counterparts,"Although the friction and wear behavior of plasma sprayed aluminum matrix ceramic coatings have been extensively discussed in the last decades, only few researches have been carried out the wear mechanisms sliding against different pairs. The tribological behaviors of plasma sprayed Al2O3 coating sliding against ZrO2, Si3N4, Al2O3 and stainless steel balls in air were comparatively investigated in this study. It was showed that Al2O3 coating sliding against different counterparts exhibited diverse tribological behaviors, which could be mainly ascribed to the different mechanical properties of counterparts. Meanwhile, the tribochemical reactions influenced the friction performances significantly. Moreover, the transform of γ-Al2O3 to α-Al2O3 occurred during the friction, which was closely related to the coefficient of friction and thermal conductivities of counterparts. The main wear of Al2O3 coating sliding against ceramic materials resulted from the brittle fracture and abrasive wear. While it was dominated by adhesive wear when sliding against stainless steel, and accompanied with abrasive wear.","Deng, Wen;Li, Shuangjian;Hou, Guoliang;Liu, Xia;Zhao, Xiaoqin;An, Yulong;Zhou, Huidi;Chen, Jianmin",2017-06-15,Ceramics International,"Al2O3 coating,Plasma spraying,Tribological performance,Different counterparts",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.02.122,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.02.122
Evaluation of Yttria Coated High Density Graphite with Silicon Carbide Interlayer for Uranium Melting Applications,"Yttrium Oxide (Y2O3) deposited over High Density Graphite (HDG) by Atmospheric Plasma Spray (APS) process is highly desirable as a chemical barrier coating for reusable Uranium (U) melting crucibles in the pyrochemical reprocessing of spent metallic fuels. In the present study, an oxidation protective Silicon Carbide (SiC) interlayer coating over HDG has been achieved by pack cementation process. The high-temperature oxidation resistance and resistance to thermal fatigue failure of Y2O3 coating with and without SiC interlayer were evaluated by performing repeated thermal cycling studies at 1450, 1500 and 1550 °C. The durability performance of Y2O3 coating with SiC interlayer in the actual working environment was simulated by performing U melting studies using miniature size HDG coated crucibles. The microstructural, chemical and phase characterization of coatings prior and post thermal cycle failure were carried out by SEM/EDS and XRD techniques. It is observed that the SiC interlayer developed by novel pack cementation technique for the Y2O3 top coat extended the thermal cycling and life of the coating with U melting in inert argon gas environment significantly. The occurrence of micro-cracking over Y2O3 top coat with SiC interlayer perceived after 33, 30 and 25 thermal cycles at 1450, 1500 and 1550 °C, respectively.","Madhura, B.;Vetrivendan, E.;Rao, Ch.

Effects of titanate coupling agent on the dielectric properties of NiZn ferrite powders–epoxy resin coatings,"During ferrite powder–polymer resin slurry preparation, the ferrite particles tend to hold together, forming agglomerates, which lead to the formation of micro-structural defects in the ferrite powder–polymer coatings. These defects affect the quality of magnetic devices. In this study, the titanate coupling agent effects on the NiZn ferrites powder dispersion in an epoxy resin and solvent system and the electromagnetic properties of NiZn ferrite powders–epoxy resin composite coatings are investigated. It was observed that the dispersion of NiZn ferrite powders and the affinity of NiZn ferrites and epoxy resin can be substantially enhanced by coating a titanate coupling agent onto the ferrite powder surfaces. This coating promotes mixing homogeneity and increases the dielectric constants at low frequencies (below 100Hz) due to the increase in phase boundary between the NiZn ferrite powders and epoxy resin.","Chen, Wei-Sheng;Chang, Yu-Lun;Hsiang, Hsing-I;Hsu, Fu-Chi;Yen, Fu-Su",2011-09-30,Ceramics International,"C.

Synthesis of (h-BN)/SiO2 core–shell powder for improved self-lubricating ceramic composites,"An easy and effective preparation method has been achieved for the fabrication of core-shell-structure (h-BN)/SiO2 composite powders. Ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) was used as a catalyst. Silica (SiO2, ~50–100nm) was coated on the surface of lamellar hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN, ~5–10μm) particles via hydrolysis and condensation reaction of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS). The resulting composite powders were characterized using XRD (X-ray diffraction), SEM (Scanning electron microscopy), EDS (Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) and TEM (Transmission electron microscopy). A completely compact and uniform SiO2 coating binds tightly to h-BN particles. In addition, the effects of the reaction temperature and molar ratio of H2O and NH4OH between TEOS on the coating results are studied. The coating processes of the composite powders reveal that SiO2 nucleates and grows first on the surface of h-BN particles. By adding (h-BN)/SiO2 instead of h-BN as a solid-lubricant to Al2O3/TiC, the resulting microstructure, fracture-toughness and flexural strength of the composite are noticeably improved.","Chen, Hui;Xu, Chonghai;Xiao, Guangchun;Chen, Zhaoqiang;Ma, Jun;Wu, Guangyong",2016-03-31,Ceramics International,"D.

Effect of substrate on the microstructure and thermoelectric performances of Sr-doped Ca3Co4O9 thick films,"Ca3Co4O9 thermoelectric materials in form of thick films are very promising in practical applications due to their low costs and relatively high performance. In this work, two different suspensions have been used to produce different coatings on Al2O3 polycrystalline substrates with theoretical green thickness of 360 and 2000 µm. Moreover, the effect of substrate has also been investigated using Al2O3 monocrystalline substrates and a 360 µm green thickness. Sintering procedure at 900 °C for 24 h has drastically decreased coating thickness. XRD performed on the coatings surface has shown the formation of small amounts of Ca3Co2O6 secondary phase on the polycrystalline substrates, while it was more abundant, and accompanied by Ca2Co2O5 on the monocrystalline substrates. In spite of the higher secondary phases content, monocrystalline substrates produced a slight grain orientation which led to the highest thermoelectric properties between the samples (0.38 mW/K2m at 800 °C), and very close to the best reported values in the literature.","Torres, M.A.;Mora, M.;Amaveda, H.;Madre, M.A.;Sotelo, A.",2019-04-01,Ceramics International,"Ceramics,Oxides,Thick films,Microstructure,Electrical properties,Thermoelectrics",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.245,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.245
"Influence of CrN, TiAlN monolayers and TiAlN/CrN multilayer ceramic films on structural, mechanical and tribological behavior of β-type Ti45Nb alloys","CrN, TiAlN single layers, and CrN/TiAlN multilayer ceramic films were deposited on Ti45Nb substrates by an industrial cathodic arc PVD process. The phase structures, the cross-sectional morphology, adhesion strength, surface hardness, and tribological behavior of the resulting uncoated and coated samples were evaluated in detail. The results showed that the preferred orientation was changed from (200) in CrN and TiAlN single layer films to (111) plane in the TiAlN/CrN multilayer films. The multilayered TiAlN/CrN films had smaller crystallite size than the single CrN and TiAlN films. The multilayer film coated samples exhibited the maximum surface hardness and the best adhesion strength among all samples. In addition, the results of wear tests present that all ceramic coatings showed better tribological properties than uncoated TiNb45 substrate materials and the best performance was observed from multilayer film-coated samples.","Çomakli, Onur",2020-04-15,Ceramics International,"Ti45Nb,Cathodic arc physical vapour deposition,TiAlN/CrN multilayer ceramic coating,Wear",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.046,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.046
Magnetically induced heating by iron oxide nanoparticles dispersed in liquids of different viscosities,"The AC magnetically induced heating characteristics of uncoated and silica-coated magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles dispersed in liquids of different viscosities were investigated. The aim was to synthesize and prepare uncoated and silica-coated nanoparticles of maghemite, and evaluate their ability to hyperthermically dissipate heat under an applied AC magnetic field when they are dispersed in liquids of different viscosities. A conceptual approach on the relative contributions of the Néel and the Brownian relaxation mechanisms to the hyperthermic heating of these suspensions is proposed. The microstructure, the physical and chemical properties of the uncoated and silica-coated nanoparticles were assessed by transmission electron microscopy; powder X-ray diffraction; 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; zeta potential measurements; and conventional chemical analysis. Results of the Rietveld refinement of the XRD patterns and analysis of the collected Mössbauer data are well consistent with maghemite as being the only iron oxide phase. The mean diameters of the uncoated nanoparticles increased from ~6 to 7 nm, to 35 and 78 nm, for added silica coating amounts varying from 1 to 6-fold, respectively. Zeta potential measurements confirmed the efficiency of the nanoparticles sol-gel coating method. When dispersed in low viscosity media (water, triethanolamine, ethylene glycol), uncoated nanoparticles efficiently release heat via both Néel and Brown relaxation mechanisms under an applied oscillating magnetic field, achieving a temperature raise of approximately 21 °C. The silica layers tend to inhibit the Brownian motion of coated particles, making heat dissipation to be preferentially governed by the Néel relaxation of the magnetization vector. This leads to modest rises in temperature of 9 °C when they are dispersed in water or in the PVC (polyvinyl chloride). SAR tests indicate that the maghemite-silica core-shell systems might be useful for advanced technologies in medical practices based on local hyperthermia, particularly in oncology.","Andrade, Ângela Leão;Cavalcante, Luis Carlos Duarte;Fabris, José Domingos;Pereira, Márcio César;Fernandez-Outon, Luis Eugenio;Pedersoli, Davyston Carvalho;Ardisson, José Domingos;Domingues, Rosana Zacarias;Ferreira, José M.F.",2020-09-30,Ceramics International,"Magnetic nanoparticles,Silica,Mössbauer spectroscopy,Néel and Brownian relaxations",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.249,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.249
"Influence of original powders on the microstructure and properties of thermal barrier coatings deposited by supersonic atmospheric plasma spraying, part II: Properties","In this paper, the thermal shock resistance, oxidation resistance and thermal insulation performance of “conventional” microsized and nanostructured coatings (named as MC and NC respectively) deposited by supersonic atmospheric plasma spraying (SAPS) were investigated. The results showed that due to the improvement of intersplat cohesion and bonding strength between the top coat and bond coat, the MC presented a higher thermal shock resistance, which was distinct from the previous reports about the property difference between the conventional and nanostructured coatings. In addition, the result from isothermal oxidation test indicated that the oxidation kinetics of both coatings followed a parabolic law. The weight gain of MC was slightly lower than that of NC before 600h at 1100°C. However, due to the formation of vertical cracks which penetrated the whole top coat, the weight gain for MC after 1000h was slightly higher than that of NC, indicating that the NC had a higher oxidation resistance after long time exposure. Meantime, because lots of fine cracks were formed between the unmelted particles and lamellar structures, the temperature drop (ΔT) of NC increased with the increase of testing times. The nanostructured SAPS-coating showed better oxidation resistance and thermal insulation properties, but the inter-splat cohesion and top coat/ bond coat interface adhesion are still needed to be improved in order to increase its thermal cycling life.","Bai, Y.;Zhao, L.;Tang, J.J.;Ma, S.Q.;Ding, C.H.;Yang, J.F.;Yu, L.;Han, Z.H.",2013-05-31,Ceramics International,"C.

"Stress states in plasma-sprayed thermal barrier coatings upon temperature cycling: Combined effects of creep, plastic deformation, and TGO growth","To ascertain material parameter effects on the stress states is beneficial to comprehend the crack growth behavior and delamination mechanism in thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). In this work, numerical models are established to explore the combined effects of material parameters including creep, plastic deformation, and thermally grown oxide (TGO) growth on the stress states upon temperature cycling. For all layers, thermal-physical properties reliant on temperature are incorporated into the model. The process of bond coat (BC) oxidation, namely TGO growth, is materialized by changing material properties with cycles. Based on the principle of a single variable, the residual stress states are explored using many different material combinations. The results indicate that the tensile stress in the ceramic top coat (TC) decreases with the increase in the TGO lateral strain distribution gradient. Increasing the BC yield strength or decreasing the TGO growth stress can reduce the tensile stress in TC if there is no creep in the model. When BC yield strength is relatively high (≥150 MPa), BC creep will strengthen the TC tensile stress. TGO creep can decrease the tensile stress in TC irrespective of TGO growth stress and BC creep. When TGO creep rate is higher than 10B tgo, an exceedingly small tensile stress can always be achieved. This work could provide significant theory direction for material selection and composition control towards advanced TBCs with prolonged lifetime.","Wei, Zhi-Yuan;Cai, Hong-Neng;Tahir, Adnan;Zhang, Wei-Wei;Li, Xue-Feng;Zhang, Yan;Huang, Ya-Ping;Liu, Yang",2019-11-30,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs),Bond coat oxidation,Creep behavior,Plastic deformation,Numerical simulation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.238,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.238

X-ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), impedance analyzer were utilized to measure the orientation and dielectric characteristics of films for comparison. The experimental results indicated that the poling voltage would not affect the orientation of crystallization, microstructure and grain size of PZT film surface. However, the higher applied poling voltage would result in better charge storage capacity and energy transfer efficiency of the film.","Cheng, Chin-Chi",2016-08-15,Ceramics International,"PZT film,Spin coating,Corona poling,Poling voltage,Dielectric constant",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.032,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.032
HfC-ZrC-SiC multiphase protective coating for SiC-coated C/C composites prepared by supersonic atmospheric plasma spraying,"HfC-ZrC-SiC (HZS) multiphase coating was deposited on the surface of SiC-coated carbon/carbon composites by supersonic atmospheric plasma spraying. The morphology and microstructure of HZS coating were characterized by XRD and SEM. The as-prepared coating was composed of different carbides and oxides. The structure was dense and crack free. Each element distributed uniformly in the coating. Ablation resistance test was carried out by oxyacetylene torch. During ablation, the outer coating underwent a process of solid state sintering and formed a dense Hf-Zr-Si-O layer on the surface of coating gradually, which could prevent the oxygen diffusing inward. The inner coating was oxidized gradually with the oxygen permeation and the structure was loose. In addition, the newly formed HfSiO4 and ZrSiO4 were generated after cooling, which could play a pinning effect and prevent crack extension.","Yang, Yang;Li, Kezhi;Zhao, Zhigang;Liu, Guanxi",2017-01-31,Ceramics International,"Carbon/carbon composites,Supersonic atmospheric plasma spraying,Multiphase coating,Ablation property",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.120,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.120
Microstructure and properties of rare earth CeO2-doped TiO2 nanostructured composite coatings through micro-arc oxidation,"Rare earth cerium oxide (CeO2) – doped TiO2 nanostructured composite coatings were obtained through micro-arc oxidation technique on titanium substrates. The surface hardness and corrosion resistance of the substrates were improved. The results of X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive spectrum, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy show that the composite coatings mainly consist of rutile-TiO2, anatase-TiO2, and CeO2. The CeO2 content was increased by increasing the current density and electrolyte concentration. CeO2 was observed on the surface as well as in the deep layers. The scanning electron microscopy results display that the number of micro-holes decreased. The holes became bigger, and a smooth area appeared around the micro-holes. The surface roughness of the composite coatings was initially reduced but subsequently increased with increasing CeO2 concentration, while the thickness of the composite coatings increased. The results demonstrated that the surface hardness of the coatings was enhanced to 609.17 Hv at the CeO2 concentration of 4g/L, and the corrosion current decreased to 1.584e-007 A at 6g/L.","Di, Shichun;Guo, Yupeng;Lv, Hongwei;Yu, Jie;Li, Zhenwei",2015-06-30,Ceramics International,"Micro arc oxidation,Pure titanium,Rare earth CeO2,Hardness,Corrosion property",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.12.134,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.12.134
Numerical study of residual stress and crack nucleation in thermal barrier coating system with plane model,"The residual stresses could cause extensive damage to thermal barrier coatings and even failure. A finite element model of thermal barrier coating system had been designed to simulate the residual stresses and then to analyze the crack nucleation behavior. The distribution of normal and tangential stress components along top coat (TC) / thermally grown oxide (TGO) and TGO / bond coat (BC) interfaces are shown in this work. It is found that the maximum tensile stress along TC/TGO interface occurs in the peak region during heating-up, and that along TGO/BC interface is also located in the peak region, but during the process of cooling-down. A parameter correlating the normal stress component with corresponding tangential one was used to evaluate the interfacial cracks, indicating that cracks will initiate at the peak-off region of TC/TGO interface in the heating-up phase, but for TGO/BC interface, cracks will initiate at the peak position in the cooling-down phase.","Yu, Q.M.;Cen, L.;Wang, Y.",2018-04-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating system,Finite element analysis,TGO thermal-growth,Evolution of residual stresses,Evaluation of interfacial cracks",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.112,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.112
Mechanical properties of thermally sprayed porous alumina coating by Vickers and Knoop indentation,"Depending on the thermal spraying conditions, coatings obtained can present different defects, like pores, cracks and/or unmelted particles, and different surface roughnesses, that can affect the determination of the hardness and elastic modulus. The present work investigates the mechanical properties, determined by means of Knoop and Vickers indentations, of a plasma as-sprayed alumina coating, obtained with a nano-agglomerated powder sprayed using a PTF4 torch, in order to highlight how the surface defects interfere into the indentation process. As a main result, Knoop indentation compared to Vickers one gives less dispersive results (15% and 33%, respectively), that are, in addition, more representative of the coating properties. The mean values obtained are 110 ± 40 GPa for the elastic modulus and 1.75 ± 0.42 GPa for the hardness. In addition, and for the two indenter types used, multicyclic indentation has been performed because it allows a more appropriate characterization of such heterogeneous coatings due to the representation of the mechanical properties as a function of the indentation load and/or the penetration depth, leading to more reliable results according to the depth-variability of the coating microstructure.","Ben Ghorbal, G.;Tricoteaux, A.;Thuault, A.;Ageorges, H.;Roudet, F.;Chicot, D.",2020-08-15,Ceramics International,"Instrumented indentation,Knoop and vickers hardness,Mechanical properties,Plasma spray,Alumina coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.039,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.039
"Preparation of nano - coating powder CaF2@Al(OH)3 and its application in Al2O3/Ti(C,N) self-lubricating ceramic tool materials","Nano CaF2 particles of different sizes were prepared by direct precipitation. The diameters of nano CaF2 particles prepared in mixed solvent can reach 5–7 nm, and can be effectively dispersed. The surface of nano CaF2 was modified and coated by heterogeneous nucleation method.

Synthesis of a novel nanostructured zinc oxide/baghdadite coating on Mg alloy for biomedical application: In-vitro degradation behavior and antibacterial activities,"In this research, zinc oxide (ZnO) and zinc oxide/baghdadite (ZnO/Ca3ZrSi2O9) were prepared on the surface of Mg alloy using physical vapor deposition (PVD) coupled with electrophoretic deposition (EPD). For this purpose, the nanostructured ZnO was prepared with a thickness of 900nm and crystallite sizes of 64nm as under layer while nanostructured baghdadite with a thickness of 10µm was deposited on the Mg alloy substrate as an over-layer. Electrochemical measurement exhibited that the ZnO/Ca3ZrSi2O9-coated specimen has a higher corrosion resistance and superior stability in simulated body fluid (SBF) solution in comparison with the ZnO-coated and bare Mg alloy samples. Antibacterial activities of the uncoated and coated specimens were evaluated against various pathogenic species (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Shigella dysenteriae) via disc diffusion method. The obtained results showed that ZnO and ZnO/Ca3ZrSi2O9 coatings have great zones of inhibition (ZOI) against E. coli, Klebsiella, and Shigella. However, less ZOI was found around the bare Mg alloy. Therefore, ZnO/Ca3ZrSi2O9 is a promising coating for orthopedic applications of biodegradable Mg alloys considering its excellent antibacterial activities and high corrosion resistance.","Bakhsheshi-Rad, H.R.;Hamzah, E.;Ismail, A.F.;Aziz, M.;Kasiri-Asgarani, M.;Akbari, E.;Jabbarzare, S.;Najafinezhad, A.;Hadisi, Z.",2017-12-01,Ceramics International,"Mg alloy,Baghdadite,Zinc oxide,Antibacterial activities,Corrosion behavior",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.233,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.233
Controllable coating of boron nitride on ceramic fibers by CVD at low temperature,"Boron nitride (BN) is a promising interface material for preparing continuous fiber reinforced ceramic matrix composites (CFCCs or CMCs). However, the controllable coating of BN on ceramic fibers remains a challenge. We developed a low-temperature chemical vapor deposition (CVD) approach for producing controllable coating BN on alumina fibers using ammonia borane (BH3NH3) as single source precursor at atmospheric pressure. The optimized sublimation temperature for BH3NH3 is 130°C and at this temperature the precursor could produce monomeric aminoborane (BH2NH2) and borazine (B3N3H6) for the subsequent CVD growth of BN. BN coatings obtained at the deposition temperature of 700°C was of high purity as confirmed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Scanning electron microscopy images of BN coated fibers indicated that the coatings produced under deposition temperature in the range of 700–900°C enwrapped on fibers continuously and tightly as the surface of the fiber was smooth and uniform. Annealing at a higher temperature of 1000 and 1300°C greatly improved the crystallinity of BN coatings deposited at 700°C as confirmed by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction and high resolution transmission electron microscopy characterization. Mechanism of this low-temperature CVD was investigated as well, and based on the understanding of deposition mechanism, the thickness and structure of the BN coatings could be controlled by turning the deposition temperature and duration. The tensile strength of alumina fibers before and after BN deposition at the temperature of 700, 800, and 900°C for 1.5h were investigated, and at the optimized deposition temperature of 700°C, the tensile strength retention was up to 94.9%, which demonstrates the great potential of this approach for fabricating high performance continues fiber reinforced ceramic matrix composites.","Sun, Nijuan;Wang, Chi;Jiao, Liying;Zhang, Juan;Zhang, Dahai",2017-01-31,Ceramics International,"Low-temperature CVD,Ammonia borane BN coating,Ceramic fibers",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.123,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.123
Electrochemical and structural characterisation of zirconia reinforced hydroxyapatite bioceramic sol–gel coatings on surgical grade 316L SS for biomedical applications,"Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)/hydroxyapatite (HAP) composite coatings on surgical grade 316L stainless steel was carried out using sol–gel dip coating and calcination process. Various molar ratios of HAP and YSZ was developed, each YSZ/HAP gel coating showed an average particle size of ∼30nm and the coatings were dried and calcined for crystallization. The functional group and crystallization characteristics of the coatings were analyzed using (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersion X-ray analysis (EDXA). The formation of β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) was controlled changing the Ca/P ratio in HAP phase and also YSZ content in the composite coatings. It was revealed that TCP content showed a very minimum value at Ca/P ratio of ∼1.67 and at YSZ content of 30vol.%, respectively. The mechanism of increased β-TCP content with Ca/P ratio lower than 1.67 and increased YSZ content was explained as Ca-deficiency due to the Ca-diffusion into t-ZrO2 crystals to form a solid solution. The resultant coatings were analysed for its corrosion resistance through polarisation, impedance and ICP-AES analysis in simulated body fluid. The viability of the reinforced coatings were analysed by in vitro cell culture studies.","Balamurugan, A.;Balossier, G.;Kannan, S.;Michel, J.;Faure, J.;Rajeswari, S.",2007-05-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Effect of the silica sol–Gel coatings on the properties of glass substrate,"Strengthening of the glass substrate with silica sol-gel coatings was investigated. Sol–gel silica coating microstructure (is related to the degree of substrate strengthening), as it is known depends on the silica sol structure. In order to produce different microstructures of the silica coating, a variety of silica sols were prepared starting from TEOS and changing the water and solvent content, catalyst type and concentration, at room temperature. Carefully prepared glass surfaces were coated with silica sol using a dipping technique, with constant withdrawing rate (all physical parameters of the deposition were constant, since they can additionally change the coating microstructure). After specific heat treatment of the samples, the modulus of rupture was calculated using the measured flexural strength data. The degree of the substrate strengthening depends on the quantity of water used for the sol preparation, coating sol pH, state of the substrate surface and the degree of the coating bonding to the substrate (all mentioned parameters are discussed as to how they effect the silica sol structure). Results showed that strengthening of the glass substrate is effected by the microstructure of the silica coating.","Nikolic, L.;Radonjic, L.",1998-09-30,Ceramics International, ,10.1016/S0272-8842(97)00055-2,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0272-8842(97)00055-2

Optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examinations revealed that there is a uniform coating layer with no spalling and delamination. However, there is a little amount of porosity. The results indicated that the application of bond coat layer in the plasma spraying of Al2O3 and Al2O3–13wt.% TiO2 on pure titanium substrate has increased the hardness and bonding strength of coatings. While the adhesive bonding is dominant without bond coat, the cohesive bonding is dominant with the application of the bond coating layer. It has been observed that percentage of cohesion strength was about three times higher than that of adhesion strength.","Yılmaz, Şenol",2009-07-31,Ceramics International,"B. Porosity,C.

Evaluation of hydroxyapatite and β-tri calcium phosphate microplasma spray coated pin intra-medullary for bone repair in a rabbit model,"Here we report a comparative study of the healing kinetics of surgically created artificial defects in the tibia of New Zealand white rabbits. Comparison of the healing kinetics was made for uncoated conventional SS316L intramedullary pins, and the same pins with microplasma sprayed (MIPS) pure hydroxyapatite (HAp) and beta-tri calcium phosphate (β-TCP) coatings. After thorough material characterizations including XRD, FTIR, SEM, etc., MIPS coated pins were implanted to such animals. Serum biochemistry, radiology and fluorochrome labelling were used to evaluate the comparative healing kinetics of these implants in vivo. In comparison to those of the uncoated pins, the pins coated with both MIPS HAp and β-TCP showed significant increment of alkaline phosphatase up to 15th postoperative day, insignificant changes in serum phosphorus and calcium with uneventful healing of bone defect. There was development of Havarsian canals and well-defined peripherally placed osteoblasts along with evidence of angiogenesis and comparatively more new bone formation in the defect site.

Preparation of TiC-Ti3AlC composite coated graphite flakes and their improved oxidation resistance,"The weak oxidation resistance has severely hindered graphite from various high temperature applications, therefore in this paper a molten salt technique was proposed to prepare titanium aluminium carbide based coatings on graphite flakes to overcome this problem. The resultant TiC-Ti3AlC coated graphite showed higher peak oxidation temperature (~ 900 °C) than the uncoated one (700 °C), suggesting that the coatings will afford graphite with superior oxidation resistance. Such improvements can be largely ascribed to not only the homogenous and crack-free TiC-Ti3AlC coatings and their resultant relicts of TiO2 and Al2O3, but also the molten salt technique for preparing the coatings. Especially the molten salts offer fast dissolution/melting/dispersion of Ti/Al powders, rapid reaction with graphite in the salt melts, and homogenous growth of the carbide coatings on the surface of graphite flakes at as low temperatures as 950–1150 °C.","Liu, Xiaoguang;Zhang, Shaowei;Li, Yan;Yang, Xiuyu;Zhang, Yue",2018-12-15,Ceramics International,"Coatings (B),TiC (D),Ti3AlC (D),Graphite (D),Oxidation resistance (C)",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.029,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.029
Silica-coated nanocrystalline TiO2 with improved thermal stability,"Deposition of a SiO2 coating on anatase TiO2 nanocrystals is shown to improve their thermal stability. As low as 0.5% Si was shown to preserve the small anatase crystallite size after calcination at 600 °C. Such treatment led to considerable sintering of TiO2 nanocrystals without the silica with the average particle size growth from 9 to 50 nm, surface area decrease from 135 to 22 m2/g and partial anatase conversion to rutile. The phase composition, crystallite size, and surface area of 5%Si-TiO2 samples were largely preserved till the temperatures as high as 800 °C whereas the anatase phase was mostly stably even after calcination at 1000 °C. The phase transformation from anatase to rutile in xerogel TiO2 and TiO2@SiO2 samples apparently did not occur until the crystallites grew larger than the critical size about 50 nm. Electron-acceptor sites capable of ionizing perylene to its radical cations were observed on all samples with anatase crystalline structure. So, the silica shell deposition improves the TiO2 thermal stability without limiting access to the surface active sites.","Bedilo, Alexander F.;Shuvarakova, Ekaterina I.;Volodin, Alexander M.",2019-02-15,Ceramics International,"A.

Effects of pH value and temperature on the corrosion behavior of a Ta2N nanoceramic coating in simulated polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell environment,"To improve the corrosion resistance and electrical conductivity of Ti-6Al-4V bipolar plates used in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), a novel electro-conductive Ta2N nanoceramic coating was developed by reactive sputter-deposition using a double cathode glow discharge plasma technique. The microstructure of the coating consisted of fine equiaxed Ta2N grains with an average grain size of ∼13nm, which exhibited a strong (101) preferred orientation. To explore the influence of both pH values and temperatures on the corrosion resistance of the coating, the electrochemical behaviors and electronic properties of passive films grown on the Ta2N coating were systematically investigated using different electrochemical techniques in simulated PEMFC operating environment. It was shown that either increasing the acidity or the temperatures of the solution, the corrosion potential (Ecorr) decreased and the corrosion current density (icorr) increased. At a given temperature or pH value, the Ta2N coating had a higher Ecorr and lower icorr as compared with uncoated Ti-6Al-4V. The results of EIS measurements showed that with increasing temperature or acidity of the solution, the resistance of the passive film (Rp) formed on the Ta2N coating decreased slightly, being of the order of magnitude of 107 Ωcm2, which was an order of magnitude higher than that of uncoated Ti-6Al-4V. The interfacial contact resistance (ICR) values were found to increase with increasing pH value or decreasing solution temperature, and the ICR values of the Ta2N coating were markedly lower than that of uncoated Ti-6Al-4V, due to the thinner thickness of passive films. Furthermore, the Ta2N-coated Ti-6Al-4V is more hydrophobic than bare Ti-6A1-4V, which was favorable for both the simplification of water management and improving corrosion resistance in PEMFC operating environment.","Ma, Jin jin;Xu, Jiang;Jiang, Shuyun;Munroe, Paul;Xie, Zong-Han",2016-11-15,Ceramics International,"Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC),Bipolar plate,Titanium alloy,Ta2N coating,Corrosion resistance,Conductivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.175,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.175
The structure and multifunctional behaviors of Mn–ZnO/Mn–ZnS nanocomposites,"Mn–ZnO/Mn–ZnS nanocomposites have been synthesized by using Mn–ZnO nanorods as templates through a simple sulfidation reaction. The incorporated Mn dopants are in 2+ valence state and substitute for Zn2+ ions in both ZnO and ZnS host lattice. The Mn–ZnO nanorods display robust ferromagnetism as well as weak ultraviolet and visible emissions at room temperature. The coating of Mn–ZnS layer results in the decrease of ferromagnetism and the significant enhancement of visible emission in orange region. Meanwhile, the band gap of the nanocomposites increases as the sulfidation time prolongs. By studying the variation of ferromagnetism with the sulfidation time, it is concluded that the observed strong ferromagnetism in Mn–ZnO nanorods mainly originates from the surface region where the ferromagnetism is much stronger relative to the core area of the nanorods.","Liu, Xiaofang;Chen, Xiaobo;Cui, Xinrui;Yu, Ronghai",2014-11-30,Ceramics International,"B.

Oxidation protective glass coating for magnesium silicide based thermoelectrics,"A Mg2Si–Mg2Sn based thermoelectric material (TE), with composition of Mg2Si0 . 487Sn0 . 5Sb0.013, produced by ball-milling combined with spark plasma sintering, is successfully coated with a new silica-based glass, which is specifically designed, characterised and tested as an oxidation protective coating for mid-temperature range (up to 500 °C) applications. Despite the relatively high coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of Mg2(Si,Sn) based materials, very good thermo-mechanical compatibility between the substrate and the coating material is obtained. Oxidation tests, performed at 500 °C for 120 h in air, demonstrate the effectiveness of the glass coating for the protection of Sb doped Mg2(Si,Sn) thermoelectric materials.","D'Isanto, Fabiana;Smeacetto, Federico;Reece, Michael John;Chen, Kan;Salvo, Milena",2020-10-15,Ceramics International,"Oxidation protective coatings,Thermoelectric materials,Glasses,Magnesium silicides",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.212,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.212
Hot corrosion behavior of YSZ/ZrW2O8 composites exposed to V2O5 at 700°C and 850°C in air,"The hot corrosion behavior of YSZ/ZrW2O8 composites as a promising thermal barrier coating system exposed to V2O5 at 700°C and 850°C was investigated in order to better understand the influence of the incorporated ZrW2O8 with isotropic negative thermal expansion performance on the corrosion resistance. Results indicate that the ZrW2O8 incorporation could retard the degradation of YSZ from V2O5 attack and the corrosion process is significantly related to the inclusion content and the temperature. The corrosion resistance could be determined by the incorporation content, while the reaction products are only temperature dependent. At 700°C, ZrV2O7, YVO4 and m-ZrO2 were the main corrosion products, while ZrW2O8 recrystallized under the acidic environment provided by V2O5. At 850°C, ZrW2O8 decomposed and only WO3, YVO4 and m-ZrO2 could be detected as final corrosion products. The corrosion mechanisms of YSZ/ZrW2O8 composites at 700°C and 850°C were discussed based on the phase diagrams and Lewis acid-base rule as well as the volume compensation of the positive and negative expansion ceramics.","Liao, Huiqi;Dong, Shujuan;Zeng, Jinyan;Zhang, Hao;Wang, Yihui;Wang, Dezheng;Mao, Chuanyong;Huang, Yan;Jiang, Jianing;Deng, Longhui;Zhou, Xin;Cao, Xueqiang",2020-10-31,Ceramics International,"TBCs,Hot corrosion,Composite,YSZ,ZrW2O8",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.201,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.201
Microstructure and ablation performance of SiC–ZrC coated C/C composites prepared by reactive melt infiltration,"To improve the ablation resistance of carbon/carbon (C/C) composites, SiC–ZrC coating was prepared by reactive melt infiltration (RMI) on C/C composites. The microstructure and morphology of the coating were characterized by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM–EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The TEM specimen was fabricated by focused ions beam (FIB). The results show that the SiC–ZrC coating prepared on the condition of optimum parameter exhibits outstanding anti-ablation performance. After ablation for 60 s in oxyacetylene torch environment at heat flux of 4186 kW/m2, the mass ablation rate (MAR) and linear ablation rate (LAR) of the coated composites were 1.18 × 10−3g/s and 2.47 × 10−3 mm/s, which were 83.6% and 54.5% reduction compared with uncoated composites. During the ablation, the formed molten eutectics SiO2–ZrO2 can fill the pores and act as a diffusion barrier for oxygen and heat.","Zhou, Zhe;Sun, Zexu;Ge, Yicheng;Peng, Ke;Ran, Liping;Yi, Maozhong",2018-05-31,Ceramics International,"Carbon/carbon composites,SiC–ZrC coating,RMI,Ablation performance,Microstructure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.018
Magnetic Fe3O4 nanocubes coated by SiO2 and TiO2 layers as nanocomposites for Cr (VI) up taking from wastewater,"Magnetic Fe3O4 (FO) nanocubes coated by SiO2 (FO–S) and TiO2 (FO-T) layers with perfect adsorption characteristics were successfully fabricated by a simple technique, and characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area. HR-TEM analysis confirms the susccess of Fe3O4 coating with TiO2 and SiO2 with a shell thickness ranged from 24 to 33 nm and 12–16 nm, respectively. Cr (VI) elimination from wastewater by the fabricated materials was carried out using a batch adsorption method at varying initial [Cr(VI)] (10–200 ppm), initial pH (1–8), shaking speed (200–400 rpm), temperature (293–333 K), contact time (0–180 min) and adsorbent dose (0.1–0.5 g). The point of zero charges (PZC) for adsorbents was estimated. The equilibrium findings of Cr (VI) ions removal were illustrated by Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models and their kinetic results of ions were followed the pseudo-second-order sorption. The maximum adsorption capacity of Cr (VI) onto FO, FO-T, and FO-S were estimated to be 25.3, 28.7 and 32.6 mg/g, respectively. Further, the utilized adsorbents can be readily renovated and the adsorption capacity was still excellent after six sorption-regeneration cycles.","Khalaf, Mai M.;Al-Amer, Kawther;Abd El-lateef, Hany M.",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Magnetic nanocubes,Adsorption,Chromium (VI),Kinetic studies,Nanocomposites",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.064,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.064
Calcium–magnesium aluminosilicate corrosion of barium–strontium aluminosilicates with different strontium content,"In this study, the hot corrosion of barium–strontium aluminosilicate (B1−x S x AS) attacked by calcium–magnesium aluminosilicate (CMAS) was investigated at temperatures in the 1200–1400°C range. Moreover, a corrosion mechanism based on the interdiffusion of Ba/Sr and Ca cations was also proposed. The proposed corrosion mechanism indicated the diffusion of Ba/Sr cations into the CMAS, and Ca cations into the B1−x S x AS during the hot corrosion process. At 1200°C, a thin corrosion zone was formed at the interface of B1−x S x AS and CMAS due to weak diffusion of Ba/Sr and Ca cations. Further increase in the temperature led to an enhancement in the interdiffusion of Ba/Sr and Ca cations, thus significantly widening the corrosion zone. Moreover, oriental dendrites, identified as monoclinic B1−x S x AS, were found to precipitate in the molten CMAS. Attributed to the faster diffusion rate of Sr cations compared to that of the Ba cations, B1−x S x AS with a higher Sr content was found to be more prone to CMAS-induced corrosion due to the rapid loss of Sr.","Jiang, Fengrui;Cheng, Laifei;Wang, Yiguang;Huang, Xuanxuan",2017-01-31,Ceramics International,"Barium–strontium aluminosilicates,Calcium–magnesium aluminosilicate,Hot corrosion,Environmental barrier coatings",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.09.138,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.09.138
Dielectric regulation of high-graphitized fine ash wrapped cube-like ZnSnO3 composites with boosted microwave absorption performance,"Intrinsic dielectric properties and tuning conductivity play important roles in microwave absorption. Novel multi-interfaced ZnSnO3@ fine ash (ZSFA) composite was successfully synthesized by coating cube-like ZnSnO3 particles with highly graphitized gasification fine ash. After hydrothermal reaction and Ostwald ripening process, fine ash was tightly wrapped around the assembly of ZnSnO3 particles. Related electromagnetic parameters and dielectric dissipation ability were discussed with different mass additions. Owing to the strong polarization relaxation, special conductive network, and multi-interface structural design, the as-synthesized ZSFA exhibited adjustable dielectric loss behaviors and efficient microwave absorption ability. When 50% mass added, the maximum reflection loss value of the obtained ZSFA-2 is −47.8 dB at 2.5 mm thickness, showing the enhanced dielectric loss ability. Meanwhile, the widest effective absorption bandwidth (RL ≤ −10 dB) can cover 7.0 GHz (11.0–18.0 GHz) at a thickness of only 2.2 mm, which included the entire Ku band. This unique pure dielectric composite exhibited high-performance electromagnetic wave attenuation property and broadband frequency response, thereby providing a new approach to the production of a superior microwave absorber.","Gao, Shengtao;Wu, Chengli;Zhang, Yuanchun;Li, Hanxu",2020-10-13,Ceramics International,"Fine ash,ZnSnO3,Microwave absorption,Multi-interfaces,Polarization,Broadband absorption",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.074,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.074

The effect of Gd3+ and Ti4+ co-doping on the thermal radiation performance of (Sm1-xGdx)2(Hf1-xTix)2O7 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) ceramic coatings,"In this study, the (Sm1-xGdx)2(Hf1-xTix)2O7 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) ceramic coatings were fabricated by atmospheric plasma spraying. The chemical compositions, morphologies and thermo-optical properties of the samples were systemically investigated. It can be found that the infrared emissivity of (Sm1-xGdx)2(Hf1-xTix)2O7 ceramic coatings at the wavelength range of 0.76–15 μm increased with the increasing content of Gd3+ and Ti4+. The (Sm0.8Gd0.2)2(Hf0.8Ti0.2)2O7 ceramic coating exhibited the highest infrared emissivity among the coatings, which was 0.773 and 0.816 at room temperature and 1400 °C, respectively. The mechanism of the increasing infrared emissivity was attributed to the Gd3+ and Ti4+ co-doping can improve the free carrier concentration and the frequency and mode of the lattice vibration. Moreover, the (Sm0.8Gd0.2)2(Hf0.8Ti0.2)2O7 ceramic coating possessed good thermal resistance, which did not show obvious change in the phase, surface morphology and infrared emissivity after 60 h calcination at 1400 °C.","Ma, Rongbin;Li, Zongchang;Liu, Fusheng",2019-09-30,Ceramics International,"Sm2Hf2O7,Infrared emissivity,Doping,Thermal barrier coatings",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.131,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.131
Gallium loading into a polydopamine-functionalised SrTiO3 nanotube with combined osteoinductive and antimicrobial activities,"Ti-based implant materials still face implant-related infections and poor osseointegration as two major clinical challenges; thus, high-quality implantation demands a strategy that can provide Ti-based implants with long-term antibacterial ability and high osteogenic activity. In this study, gallium was successfully loaded into polydopamine-functionalised SrTiO3 nanotubes (PDA-SrTiO3 NTs) on a titanium substrate through a facile immersion method. The release of strontium and gallium from gallium-doped SrTiO3 NTs was controllably constant and had negligible cytotoxicity. The antibacterial efficacy of the NT coating was demonstrated by the inhibition zones of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The optimum contents of gallium and strontium in the coating led to enhanced cytocompatibility, osteoblast spreading and osseointegration because of the synergistic effects of strontium as a bioactive element and the porous topography of the coating surface. As observed in vivo, bone formation in rabbit-bone-defect models was improved by the proposed coating four weeks after it was implanted. According to literature, the present results show for the first time that the gallium doping of PDA-SrTiO3 NTs can effectively stimulate osteointegration—thanks to its efficacy in enhancing implant osteoinductivity—and can prevent infections. Therefore, gallium-doped PDA-SrTiO3 NT coatings can potentially function as promising bone implants for clinical applications.","Qiao, Haixia;Zhang, Chao;Dang, Xianyang;Yang, Hao;Wang, Yirao;Chen, Yunlong;Ma, Lifei;Han, Shuguang;Lin, He;Zhang, Xuejiao;Lan, Jinping;Huang, Yong",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Gallium,Polydopamine,SrTiO3 nanotubes,Antibacterial,Osteoinductivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.240,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.240
Na2SO4 and V2O5 molten salts corrosion resistance of plasma-sprayed nanostructured ceria and yttria co-stabilized zirconia thermal barrier coatings,"The hot corrosion behavior of plasma-sprayed ceria–yttria co-stabilized zirconia (CYSZ) nanostructured coatings (with the chemical composition of ZrO2–2.5wt%Y2O3–25wt%CeO2) was studied in the presence of 45wt% Na2SO4+55wt%V2O5 as the corrosive molten salts, for 6, 12, 18, 30, 72, 156, and 300h at 1000°C. As the hot corrosion products, YVO4, CeVO4 and Ce0.75O2Zr0.25 crystals were formed by leaching Y2O3 and CeO2 from CYSZ due to the reaction between the corrosive salts and (Y2O3, CeO2) stabilizers of zirconia. The CYSZ nanostructured coating showed remarkable resistance to degradation throughout the hot corrosion test, irrespective of an additional reaction with the corrosive salts. A mechanism was suggested based on the prohibition of the further diffusion of molten salts into the deeper layers of the coating, via diffusional resistance in the nanoporous media.","Hajizadeh-Oghaz, Morteza;Razavi, Reza Shoja;Ghasemi, Ali;Valefi, Zia",2016-03-31,Ceramics International,"Ceria–yttria co-stabilized zirconia,Thermal barrier coatings,Hot corrosion,Nanostructure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.12.085,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.12.085
Boron modified multi-layer MoSi2–CrSi2–SiC–Si oxidation protective coating for carbon/carbon composites,"Boron modified multi-layer MoSi2–CrSi2–SiC–Si coatings were prepared on the surface of carbon/carbon (C/C) composites by three-step pack cementation in argon. The morphology and the element distribution were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy, respectively.

These results indicated that the coatings could protect the C/C composites from oxidation at 1173K for 200h or 1773K for 200h and endure the thermal cycling for 30 cycles between 1773K and room temperature.

Dielectric and microwave absorption properties of plasma sprayed Cr/Al2O3 composite coatings,"Cr/Al2O3 coatings were fabricated by plasma spraying technology from ball milled and spray dried feedstock powders, and their microstructure, complex permittivity and microwave absorption properties were investigated. The results show that Cr particles were uniformly distributed throughout the coating with the evidence of pores, cracks and a few light contrast stringers. The complex permittivity of Cr/Al2O3 coatings increased with increasing Cr volume fraction, and the coating with higher chrome content exhibited visible frequency-dependent dielectric response. The minimum reflection loss (RL min) shifted to a lower frequency region with the increase of chrome content and coating thickness. RL min of the coating with 15vol% Cr reached –33.3dB at 8.8GHz and the reflection loss values below –10dB could be obtained in the frequency range from 8.2 to 9.7GHz when the coating thickness was 1.7mm. These results imply that the microwave absorption properties can be manipulated by tuning the coating thickness and permittivity values.","Zhou, Liang;Cui, Shan;Zhai, Ying;Luo, Fa;Dong, Yangyang",2015-12-31,Ceramics International,"Plasma spraying,Cermet coatings,Dielectric properties,Microwave absorption properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.08.024,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.08.024
Influence of the intermixed interfacial layers on the thermal cycling behaviour of atmospheric plasma sprayed lanthanum zirconate based coatings,"In application as a thermal barrier coating (TBC), yttria stabilised zirconia (YSZ) approaches some limits of performance. To further enhance the efficiency of gas turbines, higher temperature capability and a longer lifetime of the coating are needed for the next generation of TBCs. Pyrochlore oxides of general composition, A2B2O7, where A is a 3+ cation (La to Lu) and B is a 4+ cation (Zr, Hf, Ti, etc.) have high melting point, fair coefficient of thermal expansion, and low thermal conductivity which make them suitable for applications as high temperature thermal barrier coatings. Among those oxide materials lanthanum zirconate (LZ/La2Zr2O7) offers very attractive properties. This work describes the fabrication, microstructure and high temperature (1280°C) thermal cycling behaviour of lanthanum zirconate coatings with five different coating architectures, deposited using atmospheric plasma spray process. The coating architecture which had five layers with two intermixed interlayers had much longer life time than other considered architectures.

Influence of anionic and non-ionic surfactants on the synthesis of core-shell Fe3O4@TiO2 nanocomposite synthesized by hydrothermal method,"Magnetite spinel nanoparticles (Fe3O4) coated titanium dioxide has been prepared by the solvo-hydrothermal method for application in dye degradation and wastewater remediation. The core-shell Fe3O4@TiO2 nanoparticles have been synthesized using titanium butoxide (TBT) and ferric chloride as precursors. In this method, firstly, magnetite nanoparticles have been prepared through a solvothermal process using ethylene glycol as a solvent. Then, titanium butoxide was used as a precursor to synthesize Fe3O4@TiO2 core-shell nanoparticles using the hydrothermal method. The surfactants that were added, in separate synthetic processes, were anionic oleic acid and Sodium Dodecyl sulfonate, and non-ionic Polyvinylpyrrolidone and Polyethylene glycol. The effects of the various surfactants on the fabrication of core-shell magnetic nanoparticles were studied. Various characterization methods have been established to examine the morphology and magnetization features of the nanostructured particles, such as XRD, FTIR, TEM, FESEM, UV-spectroscopy, and VSM, etc., which validated the formation of Titania coated magnetite nanoparticles. The TiO2 shell formation drastically reduces the saturation magnetization of the magnetic nanoparticles. The Oleic acid as a surfactant produces the smallest nanoparticles.

Morphological studies of randomized dispersion magnetite nanoclusters coated with silica,"In this study, we report a simple way to produce randomized dispersion magnetite nanoclusters coated with silica (RDMNS) via Stöber process with minor modifications. The morphology of silica coated magnetite nanoclusters was emphasized by studying various reaction parameters including alcohols with different polarities as co-solvents, concentration of alcohol–water, concentration of alkaline catalyst (ammonia), and concentration of TEOS monomer. The results of transmission electron microscope (TEM) showed that the sizes and morphological behaviour of the magnetite nanoclusters vary accordingly with the different reaction parameters investigated. The results showed that ethanol would be the best candidate as co-solvent in the preparation of randomized dispersion magnetite nanoclusters. Besides, the optimum alcohol–water ratio has been determined to be 70–30%v/v as this concentration range could render desired shape of randomized dispersion magnetite nanoclusters. The volume of ammonia (NH3) catalyst in the reaction media also strongly governs the formation of silica coated magnetite nanoclusters in a desired shape. Apart from that, the addition of TEOS monomer into the reaction media has to be well-controlled as the excess amount of monomer added might affect the thickness of the silica layer that is coated on the magnetite nanoparticles. Prior to silica coating, the bare magnetite nanoparticles were first treated with trisodium citrate (0.5M) to enhance the particles’ dispersibility. Improvement in the size distribution and dispersibility of the magnetite nanoparticles after the citrate treatment has been examined using TEM. The XRD results show that the magnetite samples retained good crystallinity although they have been surface-modified with citrate group and silica. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) prove that the magnetite nanoparticles have been successfully coated with citrate and silica. The superparamagnetic behaviour of the magnetite samples was confirmed by VSM. The produced silica coated magnetite nanoclusters possess great potential to be applied in bio-medical research and clinical diagnosis application.","Haw, C.Y.;Chia, C.H.;Zakaria, S.;Mohamed, F.;Radiman, S.;Teh, C.H.;Khiew, P.S.;Chiu, W.S.;Huang, N.M.",2011-03-31,Ceramics International,"B.

Microstructure and deposition mechanism of CVD amorphous boron carbide coatings deposited on SiC substrates at low temperature,"Amorphous boron carbide (α-B4C) coatings were prepared on SiC substrates by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) from CH4/BCl3/H2/Ar mixtures at low temperature (900–1050°C) and reduced pressure (10kPa). The deposited coatings were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), micro-Raman spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results showed that two kinds of α-B4C coatings were deposited with different microstructures and phase compositions, and the effect of deposition temperature was significant. When deposited at 1000°C and 1050°C, the coatings exhibited a nodular morphology and had a relatively low content of boron. The free carbon was distributed in them inhomogeneously; in contrast, when deposited at 900°C and 950°C, the coatings presented a comparatively flat morphology and had a uniform internal structure and high boron content. They did not contain free carbon.

Synergistic effect of CeO2 and Al2O3 nanoparticle dispersion on the oxidation behavior of MCrAlY coatings deposited by HVOF,"In this study, the as-received and nano-scaled oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) MCrAlY coatings were deposited using high-velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) spraying process. The high-energy planetary ball-milling process was utilized to prepare CeO2 and Al2O3 nanoparticles. ODS-NiCoCrAlY feedstock powders were also developed using the ball-milling process. The various formulations of Al2O3 and CeO2 nanoparticles (0.5 and 1.0 wt%) were chosen to apply different types of ODS-NiCoCrAlY coatings. The microstructure of the as-received and ODS coatings were evaluated by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) as well as the commercial and ODS powders. Furthermore, the microhardness of different compositions of ODS coatings was accordingly investigated and the obtained results were compared with as-received coating. On account of the measurement of oxidation kinetics, the freestanding as-received and ODS coatings were exposed to air at 1000 °C up to 500 h and the thickness growth rate of the α-Al2O3 oxide layer was simultaneously examined.

The optical band gap energy (Eg) of 1, 3, 5 and 7 layers films is 3.48, 3.34, 3.14 and 2.98 eV, respectively.The average sheet resistivity (Rs)measured by four point probe technique of 1, 3, 5 and 7 layered film is 5.68 x 105, 1.67 x 105, 3.99 x 104 and 6.34 x 102 ( Ω -cm), respectively. The efficiency of 7 layered based DSSC is 1.68% which is nearly 65% improved as compared with single layered based DSSC (i.e. 1.10%). This improvement in efficiency is due to increase in grain size and decrease in Eg.","Khan, M.I.;Farooq, W.A.;Saleem, Muhammad;Bhatti, K.A.;Atif, M.;Hanif, Atif",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Stacked thin films,Mg,TiO2,DSSCs",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.133,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.133
High temperature oxidation behaviour of CVD β-SiC seal coated SiCf/SiC composites in static dry air and combustion environment,"A composite with SiC matrix and 40vol% of SiC fibres with a β-SiC coating (SiCf/SiC) was prepared by the isothermal chemical vapour infiltration process. Oxidation of the SiCf/SiC composite was investigated at 1200°C, 1300°C and 1400°C, for up to 100h in static dry air, and for up to 24h in combustion environment. In static dry air, the composite showed mass gain with nearly parabolic oxidation kinetics. The uniform oxide scale developed cracks as oxidation progressed. Oxidation in combustion environment was performed using an oxy-acetylene flame containing CO2 and H2O gases. The chemical erosion by the reaction of H2O with oxide scale was the likely ablation mechanism. At 1200°C and 1300°C, the oxidation rate was higher than that of ablation and the composite showed a net mass gain. However, at 1400°C, significant ablation was observed. Localised attack by the combustion gases caused pitting of the β-SiC seal coating. The present study shows that β-SiC seal coating remains intact at relatively lower temperatures (below 1300°C) for a shorter period of time (~24h) and is lost it at higher temperatures (~1400°C) by ablation.","Mohan, Anu;Udayakumar, A.;Gandhi, Ashutosh S.",2017-08-15,Ceramics International,"B.

"Multiscale connections between morphology and chemistry in crystalline, zinc-substituted hydroxyapatite nanofilms designed for biomedical applications","Hydroxyapatite (HA), Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, is a key material used to manufacture thin, bioactive coatings on metal implants for hard tissue regeneration. Technical challenges in their fabrication include control of the coating structure and chemical composition, as well as managing surface activation via ionic substitution. In this study, 15 – 216 nm-thick zinc-doped HA (ZnHA) thin films were grown via magnetron sputtering at room temperature. The effect of substituting Zn2+ for Ca2+ on the ultrastructures of the HA films was analyzed during several stages of film growth. Infrared vibrational scattering scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) using the ultra-broad-band IR beam from synchrotron radiation was compared with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in attenuated total reflectance (FTIR/ATR) to reveal the close relationships between local topography and the chemical compositions of the film surface and the bulk of the film. The energy delivered via ionic bombardment induced the formation of complex structures: island-shaped nanoparticles of amorphous zinc-doped calcium phosphate, coalescent islands, disordered non-stoichiometric ZnHA nanoparticles, and long-range structures of nearly stoichiometric and crystalline ZnHA. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) from synchrotron radiation, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), focusing ion beam (FIB), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) confirmed Zn substitution into the HA lattice. Zinc was distributed homogeneously within the film structure (1.6 at%) but its concentration increased slightly on the film surface. The bulk of the film consisted of crystalline, columnar ZnHA domains oriented perpendicular to the substrate surface while the regions near the film/substrate interface were preferentially disordered and non-stoichiometric.","López, Elvis O.;Rossi, André L.;Bernardo, Pablo L.;Freitas, Raul O.;Mello, Alexandre;Rossi, Alexandre M.",2019-01-31,Ceramics International,"RF magnetron sputtering,Zinc-hydroxyapatite thin films,Nanochemistry,Nano-FTIR,Biomedical applications",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.246,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.246
Transparent sapphire substrates with tunable optical properties by decorating with nanometric oxide on porous anodic aluminum oxide patterns,"A method to achieve transparent sapphire substrates with tunable optical properties is proposed. After establishing a porous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membrane on sapphire, a thin Sn layer was deposited onto the AAO nano-patterned structure and then oxidized to tin monoxide (SnO). Typically, a thin SnO coating has two characteristic absorption peaks within the visible light region, but when deposited on the high-aspect-ratio AAO, more peaks were observed due to multiple interactions. This simple multilayered structure and its investigations exhibited a new potential application for sapphire in optical controls.","Hun, Chien-Wan;Chang, Chuan-Chan;Chen, Shih-Hsun;Chen, Chien Chon;Fang, Alex;Kuo, Yu-Lin",2018-06-15,Ceramics International,"Sapphire,Anodic aluminum oxide,Optical properties,Tin monoxide",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.145,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.145
High-quality c-axis oriented non-vacuum Er doped ZnO thin films,"Preparation, growth, structure and optical properties of high-quality c-axis oriented non-vacuum Er doped ZnO thin films were studied. Zn1−x Er x O (x=0.0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, and 0.05) precursor solutions were prepared by sol–gel synthesis using Zn, and Er based alkoxide which were dissolved into solvent and chelating agent. Zn1−x Er x O thin films with different Er doping concentration were grown on glass substrate using sol–gel dip coating. Thin films were annealed at 600°C for 30min, and tried to observe the effect of doping ratio on structural and optical properties. The particle size, crystal structure, surface morphologies and microstructure of all samples were characterized by X-Ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The UV–vis spectrometer measurements were carried out for the optical characterizations. The surface morphology of the Zn1−x Er x O films depend on substrate nature and sol–gel parameters such as withdrawal speed, drying, heat treatment, deep number (film thickness) and annealing condition. Surface morphologies of Er doped ZnO thin films were dense, without porosity, uniform, crack and pinhole free. XRD results showed that, all Er doped ZnO thin films have a hexagonal structure and (002) orientation. The optical transmittance of rare earth element (Er) doped ZnO thin films were increased. The Er doped ZnO thin films showed high transparency (>85) in the visible region (400–700nm).","Asikuzun, E.;Ozturk, O.;Arda, L.;Tasci, A.T.;Kartal, F.;Terzioglu, C.",2016-05-15,Ceramics International,"ZnO,Thin Film,Er-doping,Bandgap Energy,Orientation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.02.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.02.008
Refractory metal silicides reinforced by in-situ formed Nb2O5 fibers and mullite nanoclusters,"There is keen interest in the use of refractory metal silicides as structural materials or thermal barrier coatings for a high temperature environment. However, a long-standing problem for these materials is their poor thermal shock property. To address this challenge, Nb-Al-SiC elements were introduced into the MoSi2 matrix and consolidated by in-situ hot pressing. We find that this treatment leads to improved performance of MoSi2 composites in high temperature thermal shock resistance and bending strength. After in-situ HPing, the Nb, Al2O3 particles, and SiC nanoclusters were uniformly dispersed in the MoSi2 matrix and inhibited the movement of dislocation, resulting in a strengthening effect. During the thermal shock process, the fragmentized oxide layer present in the surface of the pure MoSi2 alloy disappeared completely, and a dense multi-component oxide layer was formed in-situ on the surface of the MoSi2 composites. The dense multi-component oxide layer was composed of SiO2 glass, fiber-structured Nb2O5, and nano-sized mullite phases. The fiber structured and nano-sized oxide phases play an important role in strengthening the oxide layer.","Fan, Jing-Lian;Lu, Qiong;Feng, Pei-Zhong;Li, Wei",2017-12-15,Ceramics International,"Refractory metal silicides,In-situ hot pressing,Thermal shock resistance,Bending strength",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.010
Thermo-mechanical characterization of carbon fiber reinforced silicon carbide composites having boron nitride as an interphase material,"The carbon fiber reinforced silicon carbide composites were prepared by an isothermal chemical vapour infiltration process. In order to achieve the required density, the carbon fiber preforms in the form of rectangular panels were infiltrated by silicon carbide (SiC) matrix. Prior to the matrix infiltration, a thin coating of boron nitride, as an interphase, was applied on the fiber preform. The test samples were subjected to seal coating of silicon carbide by chemical vapour deposition process. The effect of protective SiC seal coating was examined by testing (3-point bend test) the uncoated and the seal coated samples at different temperatures. Higher value of the flexural strength was observed for the seal coated samples as compared to the uncoated samples, when got tested at high temperature (up to 1400 °C). The detailed analysis of the fractured surfaces of the tested samples was carried out.","Singh, Sarabjit;Singh, Vajinder;Kumari, Sweety;Udayakumar, A.;Bhanu Prasad, V.V.",2018-12-01,Ceramics International,"Cf-SiC Composites,ICVI, Microstructure,Boron Nitride",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.074,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.074
The influence of interface morphology on the stress distribution in double-ceramic-layer thermal barrier coatings,"The influences of the interface morphologies upon the stress distribution in the double-ceramic-layer thermal barrier coating (DCL-TBC) have been mainly studied in our present article using the finite element method. The two important interfaces in the DCL-TBC, which are interface #1 (the interface between two ceramic layers) and interface #2 (the interface between the inside ceramic layer and the bond coat (BC)), are modeled as a sinusoidal wave with considering different values of the amplitude.Results show that the interface #1 has important influence upon the stress of the top ceramic layer. Especially, in the edge of the model, the rougher interface can relief the high stress level of the top ceramic layer caused by the edge stress concentration. Similarly, the influence of the interface #2 upon the stress of different parts of the thermal growth oxide layer has also been studied.","Han, Meng;Huang, Jihua;Chen, Shuhai",2015-04-30,Ceramics International,"Double-ceramic-layer thermal barrier coating,Interface morphology,Stress distribution,Finite element simulation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.11.120,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.11.120
Cross-sectional scanning force microscopy analysis of arc-discharge-deposited diamond-like carbon films,"The surface topography and defect structure have a fundamental effect on the tribological and corrosion properties of diamond-like carbon (DLC) films. In the arc discharge deposition of thin films the problem of particle ejection is always encountered. When diamond-like carbon films are deposited using a graphite cathode macroscopic particles and clusters are ejected along the carbon plasma plume. These particles can be filtered, e.g. by using a curved magnetic field, and the number of particles hitting the growing surface can successfully be reduced. However, due to elastic collisions to the chamber wall and other surfaces it is not possible to achieve complete filtering without also drastically reducing the deposition rate. In our previous work we studied the topography of the film using scanning force microscopy (SFM). In order to understand the observed topographical features better we used in this work cross-sectional scanning force microscopy (X-SFM) and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (X-TEM) to investigate the microstructure of the DLC films. In the cross-sectional micrographs nodular growth defects bisecting the film were observed. These nodular growth defects affect the surface topography of the film and thus affect the coating performance in tribological and corrosion applications. The connection between the carbon particles and the observed nodular defects is still under investigation.","Pischow, K.A.;Koskinen, J.;Adamik, M.;Barna, P.B.",1996-12-31,Ceramics International, ,10.1016/0272-8842(95)00053-4,https://doi.org/10.1016/0272-8842(95)00053-4
Fabrication and characterization of perovskite CaZrO3 oxide thin films,"Perovskite CaZrO3 oxide thin films were prepared by the sol–gel wet chemical technology to explore the possibility of CaZrO3 to be used as a gate material for MOSFET application. Calcium acetate, Ca(CH3COO)2 and zirconium acetylacetone, [CH3COCHC(O)CH3]4Zr were chosen as precursors, diluted in acetic acid CH3COOH, then mixed and stirred to get the clear and transparent solution with desired ratio of Ca:Zr = 1:1. The spin-coating technique was then used to deposit perovskite CaZrO3 oxide thin films on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates, the wet films were then pyrolyzed and annealed at different temperatures under O2 atmosphere. These thin films were systematically characterized using differential thermal analysis (DTA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), infrared spectra (IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and electrical and dielectric measurements. The high dielectric constant, low leakage current density, and high breakdown strength suggest that CaZrO3 thin films can be used in high-k applications.","Yu, T.;Chen, C.H.;Chen, X.F.;Zhu, W.;Krishnan, R.G.",2004-12-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Fabrication and characterization of 8YSZ ceramic based abradable seal coatings by atmospheric plasma spraying,"8 wt% yttria-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ) powders are fabricated as high-temperature based materials via a solid-state reaction method and ground into spheres in this paper. Following that, 4 wt% Nickle (Ni), 4 wt% Hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) and 4 wt% PHB (Polyphenyl ester) are added to 8YSZ for getting 8YSZ ceramic-based abradable seal powders (8YSZ CASp). Then, the 8YSZ CASp are sprayed on the stainless steel substrate with a NiCoCrAlY transition layer by an atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) technology. The phase structure, surface morphology and the cross-section topography of the fabricated are analyzed, the indentation hardness and nano-indentation test are conducted. The experiments of 8YSZ ceramic-based abradable seal coatings (8YSZ CASc) show that the deposition efficiency and porosity are respectively 78.5% and 21.8%, the bond strength is 4.6 MPa, the cycle number of thermal shock resistance is 37 times, those parameters prove that the fabricated 8YSZ CASc are promising abradable seal coatings.","Zhang, Xiqian;Yang, Qionglian;Chen, Lin;Song, Peng;Feng, Jing",2020-12-01,Ceramics International,"8YSZ ceramic based,APS,Abradable seal coatings,Nano-indentation,Thermal shock resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.119,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.119
Improved corrosion resistance of Al2O3 ceramic coatings on AZ31 magnesium alloy fabricated through cathode plasma electrolytic deposition combined with surface pore-sealing treatment,"In this study, we explored the phase compositions and morphologies of the ceramic coatings from different aluminum sources (aluminum isopropoxide, aluminum nitrate, or a mixture of the two) prepared using cathode plasma electrolytic deposition (CPED) onto AZ31 magnesium alloys. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analyses of these coatings indicate that the deposited ceramic made from aluminum isopropoxide was composed of γ-Al2O3 whereas the one made from aluminum nitrate was composed of MgA12O4, and that the former was more compact and uniform than the latter. A composite coating was prepared using epoxy resin as a protective layer that sealed the micropores on the CPED coating, thereby further improving its anticorrosion property. The elemental distribution of the cross-section of the composite coating was examined via energy dispersive spectroscopy. Corrosion resistance was investigated using potentiodynamic polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in a 3.5 wt% NaCl medium, and a salt spray test. The results indicate that the corrosion protection property of the Al2O3/epoxy resin coating of the magnesium alloy was better than that of the single Al2O3 coating. A cross-cut test revealed that the adhesion of the Al2O3/epoxy resin composite coating to the magnesium alloy surface was better than that of the single epoxy resin coating. The approach presented herein provides an attractive way to modify the surface of magnesium alloys to improve anticorrosion.","Ji, Ruonan;Ma, Minyu;He, Yuntao;Liu, Chenxu;Fang, Tao;Zhang, Zhan;Wang, Yi;He, Yedong;Wu, Junsheng",2018-09-30,Ceramics International,"AZ31 magnesium alloy,Al2O3,Aluminum isopropoxide,Corrosion resistance,Cathode plasma electrolytic deposition",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.159,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.159
The effects of electrodeposition parameters on the wetting behavior of ceria coatings,"Ceria coatings were electrodeposited on copper substrates; the effects of applied current density, bath concentration and bath temperature on the morphological, structural and wetting properties of the coatings were investigated. To do so, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry, Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy and static contact angle measurement techniques were used. The results showed that, increasing the applied current density, decreasing the bath concentration and temperature lead to the formation of thick coatings with small crystallite sizes and fine morphologies including many cracks. Moreover, it was observed that application of high applied current density or concentrated bath results in the formation of coating with more hydrophilic character while bath temperature does not influence the coating wetting behavior significantly. Although as-deposited coatings exhibited hydrophilic character, their behavior changed to hydrophobic one (especially in case of thick coatings) as a result of long exposure to room atmosphere and hydrocarbon adsorption. The rate of hydrocarbon adsorption was higher in the case of coatings with finer morphologies and more cracks.","Ahmadizadeh, N.;Najafisayar, P.",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"Electrodeposition,Coating,Ceria,Wetting",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.019
The fabrication of a CeO2 coating via cathode plasma electrolytic deposition for the corrosion resistance of AZ31 magnesium alloy,"In this study, cerium oxide (CeO2) coatings were fabricated using cathode plasma electrolytic deposition for the corrosion protection of AZ31 magnesium alloy. The effects of glycerol addition to the cerium nitrate electrolyte used in CEPD on the structure and corrosion resistance performance of the coatings were investigated. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analyses of the coatings indicate that a denser CeO2 coating was formed after adding glycerol to the cerium nitrate electrolyte. Electrochemical measurements and salt spray testing exhibit that the denser CeO2 coating had a higher corrosion resistance in comparison with the specimen treated without glycerol in the electrolyte and bare magnesium alloy. In addition, the impedance magnitude of the denser CeO2 coating was more than 1 GΩ cm2 after immersion for 96 h in 1 wt% NaCl solution. The adhesiveness of the CeO2-coated magnesium alloy was evaluated using a cross-cut test, the results of which indicate that the coatings had adhered excellently to the substrates. Therefore, the CeO2 coating is a promising anticorrosive measure for magnesium alloys due to its great corrosion resistance and durability.","Ji, Ruonan;Peng, Guangchun;Zhang, Shuguang;Li, Zhong;Li, Jun;Fang, Tao;Zhang, Zhan;Wang, Yi;He, Yedong;Wu, Junsheng",2018-11-30,Ceramics International,"Cathode plasma electrolytic deposition,Cerium oxide coating,Glycerol,Corrosion resistance,AZ31 magnesium alloy",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.250,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.250
Corrosion behavior of air plasma spraying zirconia-based thermal barrier coatings subject to Calcium–Magnesium–Aluminum-Silicate (CMAS) via burner rig test,"Three different kinds of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) — 8YSZ, 38YSZ and a dual-layered (DL) TBCs with pure Y2O3 on the top of 8YSZ were produced on nickel-based superalloy substrate by air plasma spraying (APS). The Calcium–Magnesium–Aluminum-Silicate (CMAS) corrosion resistance of these three kinds of coatings were researched via burner rig test at 1350 °C for different durations. The microstructures and phase compositions of the coatings were characterized by SEM, EDS and XRD. With the increase of Y content, TBCs exhibit better performance against CMAS corrosion. The corrosion resistance against CMAS of different TBCs in descending was 8YSZ + Y2O3, 38YSZ and 8YSZ, respectively. YSZ diffused from TBCs into the CMAS, and formed Y-lean ZrO2 in TBCs because of the higher diffusion rate and solubility of Y3+ in CMAS than Zr4+. At the same time, 38YSZ/8YSZ + Y2O3 reacts with CAMS to form Ca4Y6(SiO4)6O/Y4·67(SiO4)3O with dense structure, which can prevent further infiltration of CMAS. The failure of 8YSZ coatings occurred at the interface between the ceramic coating and the thermally grown oxide scale (TGO)/bond coating. During the burner rig test, the Y2O3 layer of the DL TBCs peeled off progressively and the 8YSZ layer exposed gradually. DL coatings keep roughly intact and did not meet the failure criteria after 3 h test. 38YSZ coating was partially ablated, the overall thickness of the coating is thinned simultaneously after 2 h. Therefore, 8YSZ + Y2O3 dual-layered coating is expected to be a CMAS corrosion-resistant TBC with practical properties.","Wang, Tongxin;Shao, Fang;Ni, Jinxing;Zhao, Huayu;Zhuang, Yin;Sheng, Jing;Zhong, Xinghua;Yang, Jiasheng;Tao, Shunyan",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs),CMAS corrosion,YSZ",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.184,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.184
Effect of polyethylene glycol on porous transparent TiO2 films prepared by sol–gel method,"Multilayered titania (TiO2) films have been prepared via sol–gel dip-coating method from a tetraethyl-orthotitanate solution that contains 2g of polyethylene glycol (PEG) with different molecular weight (6000, 20,000 and 35,000). The films were deposited on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass and annealed by a thermal treatment at 450°C for 30min. We demonstrated how the structure, the morphology and the optical properties of the films can be controlled by varying the PEG molecular weight and number of depositions. The correlation between these parameters and the film properties was investigated.

The structural, morphological and silica coating formation of the bare and silica coated particles were studied using Transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. Thermogravimetric analysis and Zeta potential measurements were performed to check the thermal and dispersion stability of the nanostructures. The optical limiting performance of these nanostructures was studied using open-aperture Z-scan technique in which nanosecond laser pulses at 532nm have been used for optical excitation. Both bare and silica coated ZrO2 nanoparticles exhibited good optical limiting behavior due to excited state absorption, arising from effective three photon absorption. It is observed that the optical nonlinearity is enhanced in core shell structures as compared with the bare particles.","Mani Rahulan, K.;Vinitha, G.;Devaraj Stephen, L.;Kanakam, Charles Christopher",2013-07-31,Ceramics International,"Core–shell nanoparticles,Stober method,X-ray diffraction,Optical limiting",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.12.029,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.12.029
Tribochemical behavior of alumina coatings deposited by high-velocity oxy fuel spraying,"Alumina is one of the most versatile coatings applied on tools whose working life is reduced due to high wear rate, high temperature, and highly corrosive environments. High-velocity oxy fuel (HVOF) methods are industrially used to deposit this type of coatings. In this study, the effect of the hydrochloric acid concentration on the wear behavior of an HVOF alumina coating was investigated through room-temperature and 60°C pin-on-disk wear experiments. The results showed that the corrosive environments up to 5% acid did not meaningfully affect the wear damage rate, as compared to the dry condition, due to a contest between friction coefficient and corrosion damage. Nevertheless, the wear rate significantly increased at higher acid concentrations and higher temperatures, since the corrosion effect prevailed over the friction coefficient effect. Also, the predominant wear mechanism was recognized to be adhesive.","Khosravifard, A.;Salahinejad, E.;Yaghtin, A.H.;Araghi, A.;Akhbarizadeh, A.",2015-05-31,Ceramics International,"Films,Wear resistance,Al2O3",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.002
Enhanced tribological properties of Y/MoS2 composite coatings prepared by chemical vapor deposition,"Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is an efficient approach to prepare coatings on complex cutting tools. However, MoS2 with self-lubrication ability and excellent tribological properties fabricated by CVD have been rarely reported in literature. The aim of this study was to deposit pure MoS2 coatings and yttrium (Y) doped MoS2 (Y/MoS2) composite coatings on cemented carbide blades coated with titanium nitride by CVD. The structural and mechanical properties of the coatings were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nanoindentation, respectively. The results demonstrated that the microstructure of Y/MoS2 composite coatings was denser than that of the pure MoS2 coating. The hardness and the adhesional properties were significantly enhanced for the Y/MoS2 composite coatings. The tribological performance of the as-deposited coatings were investigated under atmospheric environment. Y/MoS2 compostite coatings demonstrated an enhanced tribological performance with a stable and low coefficient of friction (COF) over the entire sliding time. In contrast, the COF of pure MoS2 coating dramatically increased to value above 0.3 after a sliding time of only 30 min. Additionally, the Y/MoS2 composite coatings showed a decreased wear rate (8.36 ± 0.29 × 10−7 mm3/Nm) compared to the pure MoS2 coatings (3.41 ± 0.48 × 10−5 mm3/Nm) thus reflecting an improvement by two order of magnitude.","Yi, J.;Li, M.L.;Zhou, H.X.;Rosenkranz, Andreas;Wang, B.;Song, H.;Jiang, N.",2020-10-15,Ceramics International,"CVD,MoS2,Composite coatings,Solid lubrication",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.157,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.157
Mechanical and thermal properties of chemical vapor infiltration engineered 2D-woven and 3D-braided carbon silicate composites,"SiCf/SiC composites reinforced with either two-dimensional woven or three-dimensional braided preforms were fabricated by the chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) process. The microstructure, mechanical and thermal properties of the composites were studied. In comparison, the 3D-braided out-performed 2D-woven composites based on the mechanical and thermal properties. The geometry and microstructure determinants of the properties of the composites were investigated. Additionally, we tested how resilient the SiCf/SiC composites were in contact with eutectic molten salt of LiF, NaF and KF to determine whether such materials could function in a molten salt reactor. The molten salt had minimal influence on mechanical properties of SiCf/SiC composites due to the SiC coating blocking the infiltration of molten salt. Our data demonstrated the feasibility of CVI produced SiCf/SiC composites with potential applications in molten salt reactor.","Gao, Yantao;Zhou, Haijun;Liu, Min;Ye, Linfeng;Xia, Huihao",2015-11-30,Ceramics International,"A.

Damage characterization model of ceramic coating systems based on energy analysis and bending tests,"A quantitative damage model of ceramic coating systems was developed based on their load-displacement curves obtained from three-point bending tests. According to the energy mechanism of damage, the normalized damage rate of such systems can be simply expressed using the load and the tangent slope of their load-displacement curves. The experimental results demonstrated the thickness dependence of fracture and damage. In thin coating systems, tensile failure was found to be predominant and multiple transverse cracks appeared in the coatings. In contrast, thick coating systems showed a predominance of interface shear failure and the occurrence of interface delamination. These observations are consistent with previous experimental results. The damage of the systems displayed catastrophic characteristics when the load tended to reach the failure point, i.e., the damage increased rapidly, and the damage rate displayed a power-law singularity at the failure point. These results are consistent with the damage characteristics predicted using the mathematic model. The damage evolution in the case of interface delamination in the thick coating systems was faster than that for transverse cracking in the thin coatings because of the difference in the degree of damage localization. The present model provides an effective method to elucidate the damage behavior of brittle ceramic coating systems, and hence, it is expected to greatly aid the coating design.","Liu, H.Y.;Wei, Y.G.;Liang, L.H.;Liu, X.H.;Wang, Y.B.;Ma, H.S.",2018-04-01,Ceramics International,"Ceramic coatings,Damage characterization,Fracture,Thickness effect",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.068,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.068
Microstructure and kinetics of formation of Si2N2O and Si3N4 into Si porous preforms by chemical vapor infiltration (CVI),"The kinetics of formation of Si2N2O and Si3N4 into Si porous preforms via chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) in N2 and N2–5% NH3, has been investigated. In addition, the effect of the following processing parameters on the phase, amount and product morphology was investigated: atmosphere, time, temperature, gas flow rate, particle size and porosity of Si porous preforms. A Taguchi experimental design allowed establishing that atmosphere is the parameter that most significantly influences the type of phase formed and that processing time and temperature are the parameters that most significantly affect the amount and morphology of the phases formed. In nitrogen Si2N2O is formed primarily with morphology of whiskers and fibers which grow with time and temperature. In N2–5% NH3, Si3N4 is formed predominantly in the form of coatings on the Si particles. Although thermodynamically, the reaction for formation of Si2N2O is more feasible than that for Si3N4, kinetically the reaction for formation of the latter occurs faster. The activation energy (E) for the reaction with pure N2 is 88.3kJ/mol while the corresponding value for the reaction with N2–5% NH3 is 48.3kJ/mol.","de la Peña, J.L.;Pech-Canul, M.I.",2007-09-30,Ceramics International,"A.

Thermodynamic analysis on the codeposition of ZrC–SiC by chemical vapor deposition using the ZrCl4–C3H6–MTS–H2–Ar system,"A thermodynamic calculation on co-deposition of ZrC–SiC from the ZrCl4–C3H6–MTS–H2–Ar system was performed using the FactSage thermochemical software and verification experiments were performed. The surface diagrams of condensed-phases in this system were expressed as functions of the deposition temperature, total pressure, reactant ratio of MTS/(MTS+C3H6) and ratio of H2/(ZrCl4+MTS+C3H6), and the composition of the products was determined by the diagram. The calculation results indicate that their yields strongly depend on the molar ratio of the injected reactants and temperature, and ZrC–SiC can be co-deposited under a proper condition. The experimental results show that ZrC–SiC coating was successfully co-deposited on graphite substrates and carbon fibers according to the thermodynamic calculation.","Zhu, Yan;Cheng, Laifei;Gao, Shuang;Li, Jianping;Deng, Juanli;Zhang, Litong",2014-06-30,Ceramics International,"Thermodynamic calculation,Chemical vapor deposition,Zirconium carbide,Silicon carbide",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.11.091,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.11.091
Improvement in thermal shock resistance of gadolinium zirconate coating by addition of nanostructured yttria partially-stabilized zirconia,"Gadolinium zirconate (Gd2Zr2O7, GZ) as one of the promising thermal barrier coating materials for high-temperature application in gas turbine was toughened by nanostructured 3mol% yttria partially-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) incorporation. The fracture toughness of the composite of 90mol% GZ-10mol% YSZ (GZ–YSZ) was increased by about 60% relative to the monolithic GZ. Both the GZ and GZ–YSZ composite coatings were deposited by atmospheric plasma spraying on Ni-base superalloys and then thermal-shock tested under the same conditions. The thermal-shock lifetime of GZ–YSZ composite coating was improved, which is believed to be mainly attributed to the enhancement of fracture toughness by the addition of YSZ. In addition, the failure mechanisms of the thermal-shock tested GZ–YSZ composite coatings were discussed.","Zhong, Xinghua;Zhao, Huayu;Liu, Chenguang;Wang, Liang;Shao, Fang;Zhou, Xiaming;Tao, Shunyan;Ding, Chuanxian",2015-07-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Laser cladding of CoWSi/WSi2 on Ni substrate and evaluation of its high temperature oxidation behavior,"A CoWSi/WSi2 coating was cladded on a nickel substrate using Nd:YAG pulsed laser. Microstructure and composition of the coating were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) as well as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS). The microstructure evaluations demonstrated that a uniform free cracks coating was formed, which metallurgically bonded to the substrate. XRD and EDS analysis results showed that some Ni dilution occurred at the coating/substrate interface and that the coating consisted of CoWSi, WSi2 and γ-Co. Cyclic oxidation behavior of the coating indicated that the CoWSi/WSi2 coating could effectively prevent the oxidation of nickel at 1100°C in air up to 40h.

Comparison of thermal shock resistances of plasma-sprayed nanostructured and conventional yttria stabilized zirconia thermal barrier coatings,"The main goal of the current study is evaluation and comparison of thermal shock behavior of plasma-sprayed nanostructured and conventional yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). To this end, the nanostructured and conventional YSZ coatings were deposited by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) on NiCoCrAlY-coated Inconel 738LC substrates. The thermal shock test was administered by quenching the samples in cold water of temperature 20–25°C from 950°C. In order to characterize elastic modulus of plasma-sprayed coatings, the Knoop indentation method was employed. Microstructural evaluation, elemental analysis, and phase analysis were performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray diffractometry (XRD) respectively. The results revealed that failures of both nanostructured and conventional TBCs were due to the spallation of ceramic top coat. Thermal stresses caused by mismatch of thermal expansion coefficients between the ceramic top coat and the underlying metallic components were recognized as the major factor of TBC failure. However, the nanostructured TBC, due to bimodal unique microstructure, presented an average thermal cycling lifetime that was approximately 1.5 times higher than that of the conventional TBC.","Jamali, Hossein;Mozafarinia, Reza;Shoja Razavi, Reza;Ahmadi-Pidani, Raheleh",2012-12-31,Ceramics International,"Nanostructured thermal barrier coating,Yttria stabilized zirconia,Thermal shock,Atmospheric plasma spraying",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.05.060,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.05.060
Hard machining performance of PVD AlCrN coated Al2O3/TiCN ceramic inserts as a function of thin film thickness,"In the present work, AlCrN coating was deposited on Al2O3/TiCN ceramic inserts with varying thin film thickness using physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique. The thickness, surface morphology, chemical composition, hardness and adhesion strength of the coating to the substrate were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), micro-indentations and scratch tests respectively. The machining performance of uncoated and coated tools was investigated in hard turning of AISI 52100 steel (62 HRC) under dry environment. The cutting behavior was analyzed in terms of machining forces, tool temperature, wear, friction and chip morphology. Further, a 3D finite element model with hybrid friction criterion has been adopted to support the experimental findings. The results revealed that coating/substrate adhesion and edge radius were the deciding criteria for the machining performance of coated tools with 3µm coating thickness tool exhibiting best turning performance on Al2O3/TiCN mixed ceramic insert.","Sateesh Kumar, Ch;Kumar Patel, Saroj",2017-11-30,Ceramics International,"Hard turning,Mixed ceramic inserts,AlCrN coating,FEM",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.030,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.030
ETS-synthesized Hi-Nicalon fiber–SiC matrix composite,"Tough ceramic matrix composites, such as SiC/SiC, require a compliant reinforcement/matrix interface coating. The deposition of desired interface coatings on small diameter fibers in SiC/SiC composites is a substantial challenge and costly. A new carbon-rich source gas, ethyltrichlorosilane (ETS), was used to fabric SiC/SiC composite with eight harness satin-woven Hi-Nicalon fabric cloth as reinforcement by the chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) process. A graphite fiber/matrix interlayer was spontaneously formed in the material from the ETS during the CVI matrix densification process, resulting in the composite having a sound interfacial shear stress of 86MPa. The composite showed a high proportional limit stress of 450±65MPa and an ultimate flexural strength of 567±75MPa, coupled with ductile fracture behavior. This study indicates that the costly interfacial coating process might be omitted when ETS is used as source gas for SiC/SiC composite.","Yang, Wen;Araki, Hiroshi;Kohyama, Akira;Suzuki, Hiroshi;Noda, Tetsuji",2005-12-31,Ceramics International,"B.

Thermal and thermomechanical characteristics of monolithic refractory composite matrix containing surface-modified graphite,"The thermomechanical analysis (TMA) and thermal characteristics of carbon-containing refractory castable matrix with 20.0wt% graphite have been compared with graphite-free high alumina based similar castable matrix. Graphite has been added both in uncoated and coated forms, the latter having a thin sol–gel calcium aluminate coating on as-received graphite flakes. The influence of systematic variation of microfine constituents e.g. reactive alumina, high alumina cement etc in the matrix has been investigated in terms of the heat flow studies obtained by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry analysis (TGA). The densification behavior of graphite-free and graphite-containing castable matrices has been critically estimated by the dimensional changes in dynamic heating regime up to 1500°C. The role of coated graphite on improved densification behavior of refractory was explored by microstructure and phase assemblage studies of the respective fired castable. It was further corroborated by the transmission electron microscope (TEM) studies of surface-modified graphites.","Mukhopadhyay, S.;Dana, K.;Moitra, S.;BasuMallick, S.;Mukhopadhyay, T.K.",2016-04-30,Ceramics International,"A.

Effects of electrophoretic deposition times and nanotubular oxide surfaces on properties of the nanohydroxyapatite/nanocopper coating on the Ti13Zr13Nb alloy,"Load-bearing implants are developed with a particular emphasis placed on an application of ceramic hydroxyapatite coatings in order, to enhance the bioactivity of titanium implants and to shorten the healing time. Therefore, thin, fully crystalline coatings that are, highly adhesive, hydrophilic and demonstrating antibacterial properties are ly looked for. The aim of this research was to develop and characterize the properties of (nano)hydroxyapatite coatings implemented with nanocopper particles and obtained by the electrophoretic method. The deposition was carried out on the Ti13Zr13Nb alloy, either on a bare surface or a nanotubular oxide layer. The deposition was made for 1 or 2 min. The chemical composition, phase composition, coating structure, homogeneity, thickness, nanoindentation and nanomechanical properties, adhesion determined by a nanoscratch test, and wettability measured by a contact angle were investigated. The presence of nanotubular oxide layers caused no significant change in nanoindentation and nanomechanical propertie and an increase in adhesion strength and a decrease in the contact angle. The increase in deposition time resulted in an increased thickness, a decreased hardness, an increased adhesion strength and wettabilty. The observed effects in the composite (nano)HAp/Cu – (nano)TiO2 coatings are attributed to the change in the structure of coatings following the increasing deposition time and coating thickness.","Bartmanski, Michal;Zielinski, Andrzej;Jazdzewska, Magdalena;Głodowska, Joanna;Kalka, Pamela",2019-11-30,Ceramics International,"Apatite D,TiO2 D,Biomedical applications E,Mechanical properties C",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.258,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.258
Development of MgAl2O4 spinel coating on graphite surface to improve its water-wettability and oxidation resistance,"Low water-wettability and oxidation resistance of graphite have limited its application in carbon containing refractory castables. The aims of this study are the improvement of water-wettability and the oxidation resistance of natural flaky graphite by applying an oxide coating on its surface. To develop the coating, magnesium aluminate spinel sol was formulated via a citrate–nitrate route and graphite powder was then added to the sol. The mixture was heat treated in appropriate temperature and atmosphere to get the polycrystalline MgAl2O4 coating on graphite particles surface. The microstructure of coating was studied by X-ray diffractometer, SEM and TEM. The water-wettability was evaluated by measuring the water drop contact angle and plotting the zeta potential vs. pH. The results showed the development of a stable nanocrystalline MgAl2O4 spinel coating which improved the water-wettability and oxidation resistance of graphite significantly. Also, characterization of the coating is explained with emphasis on its application importance.","Saberi, Ali;Golestani-Fard, Farhad;Sarpoolaky, Hosein;Willert-Porada, Monika;Gerdes, Thorsten;Simon, Reinhard;Liebscher, Christian",2009-01-31,Ceramics International,"B.

Promoting the performances of NaTi2(PO4)3 electrode for sodium ion battery by reasonable crystal design and surface modification,"Sodium-ion battery as an attractive energy storage system is acknowledged as alternative to lithium-ion battery on account of their extensive resources and low price. NaTi2(PO4)3 is considered as an excellent electrode material in sodium-ion battery due to open three-dimensional crystal channels for ion diffusion. In this work, reasonable crystal design of Zr doping and surface modification of carbon coating strategy was employed to promote the sodium storage performances of NaTi2(PO4)3 electrode. A series of NaTi2-xZrx(PO4)3/C (x = 0.05, 0.1, 0.15) composites with core@shell structure were synthesized through an easy sol-gel route, and were applied as electrode for sodium ion battery. The result shows that the crystal type of all samples is relatively pure. However, the dispersion of Zr doped samples are significantly improved compared to the blank sample. Among all the samples, NTP-Zr-0.1 (NaTi1.9Zr0.1(PO4)3/C) demonstrates the best charge/discharge performances. It delivers the discharge capacities of 206.3 mA h g-1 at 40 mA g-1 and 79.2 mA h g-1 at 2000 mA g-1, while those of NTP are 116.2 and 26.9 mA h g-1, severally. Superior electrochemical performance of NTP-Zr-0.1 is probably ascribed to the carbon coating structure, good dispersion, and lattice volume increase, further accelerating the transfer of electron and sodium ion. This study implies that carbon coating and Zr doping are facile and efficient strategy for promoting performances of NaTi2(PO4)3/C composite.","Liu, Na;Shi, Kun;Ma, Kaixuan;Wang, Yuan;Chen, Jiafu;Zhu, Jing;Li, Yuehua;He, Zhangxing;Meng, Wei;Dai, Lei;Wang, Ling",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"Sodium-ion battery,NaTi2(PO4)3,Crystal design,Carbon coating,Sodium storage performance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.290,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.290
High growth-rate atomic layer deposition process of cerium oxide thin film for solid oxide fuel cell,"Cerium oxide (CeO2) shows superior surface exchange, and therefore is widely used for the cathode interlayer coating material to reduce the activation loss in low temperature solid oxide fuel cell (LT-SOFC). Here, we report on the application of the high growth-rate atomic layer deposition (ALD) process of CeO2 thin films as cathodic interlayers for LT-SOFCs. We demonstrate that the maximum power density of the SOFC with pure CeO2 interlayer increases by 45% compared to the one without interlayer at 450 °C. More importantly, the performance degradation rate of the ALD CeO2 interlayered cell improves by 25 times compared to the cell without interlayer during 24 h operation at 450 °C.","Yu, Jin-Geun;Yang, Byung Chan;Shin, Jeong Woo;Lee, Sungje;Oh, Seongkook;Choi, Jae-Ho;Jeong, Jaehack;Noh, Wontae;An, Jihwan",2019-02-15,Ceramics International,"Atomic layer deposition,Cerium oxide,Solid oxide fuel cell,Interlayer,Thermal stability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.050,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.050
(Ba0.5Sr0.5)TiO3 modification on etched aluminum foil for electrolytic capacitor,"A new method was proposed to form (Ba0.5Sr0.5)TiO3–Al2O3 composite oxide film on etched aluminum foils. The specimens were covered with (Ba0.5Sr0.5)TiO3 (BST) layer by dip-coating in citrate solution and subsequent heat-treatment under 400–650°C, finally by anodizing in a hot boracic acid and borate solution. The BST powders heated under different temperatures were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the specific capacitance of the coated specimens heat-treated under different temperatures and times was measured. It is found that the specific capacitance increases initially with enhancing the temperature and reaches to maximum at 550°C, but slightly decreases with the heat-treatment time. The capacitance was increased by about 35% after BST coating.","Wang, Yin Hua;Yang, Jun;Wang, Jian Zhong",2008-07-31,Ceramics International,"Electrolytic capacitor,Aluminum foil,(Ba0.5Sr0.5)TiO3,Capacitance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2007.03.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2007.03.004
The influence of temperature gradient across YSZ on thermal cyclic lifetime of plasma-sprayed thermal barrier coatings,"The influence of the temperature gradient within plasma-sprayed yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) on the thermal cyclic lifetime of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) was investigated via gradient thermal cycling test and theoretical model. YSZ surface was heated to the peak temperature in 70s, then kept for a dwell time of 50s at the peak temperature and cooled down to 100°C in 120s. YSZ surface temperatures were set to be 1150°C, 1200°C and 1250°C, corresponding to temperature differences of 150°C, 200°C and 250°C across 250µm thick YSZ coating, respectively. A theoretical model is introduced to describe the correlation between thermal cyclic lifetime and temperature gradient. Experimental results show that the temperature gradient has a remarkable impact on the thermal cyclic lifetime of TBCs, which decreases with increasing temperature gradient. The theoretical model reveals that thermal cyclic lifetime of TBCs decreases with the increase of the temperature gradient following a power function, which reasonably agrees with the experimental results. Moreover, it was found that the temperature gradient has little effect on the cracking mode of the TBCs because the stress distribution characteristics in TBCs subjected to thermal cycling with different temperature gradients remain unchanged based on the numerical simulation results.","Dong, Hui;Yang, Guan-Jun;Cai, Hong-Neng;Ding, Hang;Li, Cheng-Xin;Li, Chang-Jiu",2015-11-30,Ceramics International,"C.

Microstructures and mechanical properties of duplex-treated composite ceramic coatings with and without compound layer,"Duplex-treated composite ceramic coatings with and without compound layer were produced by the combination of plasma nitrocarburizing and follow-up multi-arc ion plating. The microstructures and mechanical properties of the ceramic coatings were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, in association with property characterization. The results show that the composite ceramic coatings are composed of an inner nitrocarburized layer, a CrN interlayer and an outmost AlCrTiSiN layer. The AlCrTiSiN layer consists mainly of alternately nanoscaled (Cr,Al)N sublayer and amorphous sublayer with a few (Ti,Al)N phases embedded in a matrix of amorphous Si3N4 and Si. The compound layer has transformed to the γ′-phase sublayer, which enhances considerably the adhesion strength of the CrN interlayer to compound layer. The improved adhesion strength is attributed to the γ′-phase acting as nucleation sites of epitaxial growth for the CrN phase. The composite ceramic coating with compound layer reveals much higher hardness, bearing capacity and wear resistance when compared with the composite ceramic coating without compound layer. The improvement of mechanical and tribological properties is associated with presence of the γ′-phase sublayer, which provides a smooth transition, gradient in hardness and stress between the substrate and the CrN/AlCrTiSiN coating. In addition, the hard γ′-phase sublayer provides a strong supporting effect for CrN/AlCrTiSiN layer under loading.","Zheng, J.;Zhang, S.H.;Wu, P.;Kwon, S.C.;Li, M.X.;Liu, S.Y.;Chen, W.L.",2015-03-31,Ceramics International,"Multi-arc ion plating,Plasma nitrocarburizing,Composite ceramic coating,AlCrTiSiN superlattice coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.10.074,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.10.074
Effect of PbTiO3 seed layer on the orientation behavior and electrical properties of Bi(Mg1/2Ti1/2)O3–PbTiO3 ferroelectric thin films,High Curie-temperature 0.63Bi(Mg1/2Ti1/2)O3–0.37PbTiO3 (BMT–PT) films were fabricated on Pt(111)/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates by the sol–gel spin-coating method. The oriented growth behavior of thin films was controlled by introducing a PT seed layer onto the platinum electrode surface. The effect of the annealing method of the PT seed layer on the orientation behavior and electrical properties of BMT–PT films was investigated. It was found that BMT–PT thin film exhibits higher (100) orientation degree when the PT seed layer was treated by rapid thermal annealing.

Microstructure assessment of suspension plasma spraying coatings from multicomponent submicronic Y-TZP/Al2O3/SiC particles,"In this research, Suspension Plasma Spraying (SPS) technique was used for the thermal deposition of a multicomponent mixture made up of an Y-TZP/Al2O3 matrix with SiC particles. Two suspensions of Y-TZP and Al2O3 with different SiC particles content (6 wt% and 12 wt%) were tested as feedstocks in the SPS process. Three stand-off distances were varied in order to assess coating microstructure and evaluate the presence of SiC in the final coatings. Coatings were characterised in terms of porosity, microstructure and phase distribution. The estimate of the amount of SiC in the coating was carried out by XRD technique. Findings showed typical cauliflower-like SPS microstructure which intensifies with stand-off distance. Coatings porosity varied significantly between 8% and 25% whereas minimum porosity was found for the intermedium stand-off distance of 40 mm. Microstructure analysis also revealed the presence of SiC particles in the coatings which was confirmed by EDX analysis, overall XRD tests as well as TG analysis. Finally, evaluation of SiC content in the final coatings by means of XRD analysis showed that most of SiC particles (c.a 80%) of the feedstocks were preserved in the final coatings.","Carnicer, Víctor;Orts, M José;Moreno, Rodrigo;Sánchez, Enrique",2018-08-01,Ceramics International,"SPS process,SiC deposition,TBCs,Self-healing coatings",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.186,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.186
Plasma thermal spray of ceramic oxide coating on carbon steel with enhanced wear and corrosion resistance for oil and gas applications,"In this work, carbon steel surface was coated with Al2O3–40wt% TiO2 composite using thermal spraying method.

Microstructure and thermal properties of a promising thermal barrier coating: YTaO4,"High temperature gas turbine sealing can increase the thermal efficiency of a gas turbine. In this paper, monoclinic phase YTaO4 ceramics were fabricated via solid-state reaction. Phase composition and microstructures of the high-temperature-sintered YTaO4 ceramics were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Raman Spectroscopy. Specific heat capacity rose gradually as temperature increased, due to volumetric expansion and phonon excitations. The thermal diffusivities and conductivities decreased significantly due to the effects of the porosity and phonon scattering. However, the thermal conductivities of the specimens were lower than that of 7–8wt% yttria-stabilized zirconia (7-8YSZ), and YTaO4 ceramics have better thermal stability than current (TBCs) material. The Vickers hardnesses of YTaO4 ceramics as a function of sintering temperature were lower than that of 8YSZ, indicating YTaO4 has better fracture toughness and thermal tolerance. The results demonstrate that YTaO4 ceramics would be an excellent candidate for use as a thermal barrier coating material for high temperature gas turbines.","Wang, Jun;Zhou, Yu;Chong, XiaoYu;Zhou, Rong;Feng, Jing",2016-09-30,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,YTaO4 ceramic,Raman spectroscopy,Thermal conductivity,Vickers hardness",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.194,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.194
"Influence of Si contents on the microstructure, mechanical and tribological properties of Cr–Si–N coatings","Cr–Si–N coatings with different Si contents were deposited by a hybrid coating system, where the Cr target was used for the arc ion plating (AIP) and the Si target for the middle frequency (MF) magnetron sputtering. The XRD, cross-sectional SEM and XPS results indicated that the Cr–Si–N coating exhibited a nanocomposite structure containing CrN nanocrystallines and amorphous Si3N4 phase. Furthermore, the TEM results showed that all the CrN nano-crystals were embedded in an amorphous matrix of a-Si3N4. The thickness of the Cr–Si–N coatings was in the range of 2.1–2.4μm while the Si content was in the range of 2.2–11.1at%. The hardness of Cr–Si–N coatings first increased and then decreased with the increase of Si content and the highest value was approximately 2490Hv at 6.94at% Si content. For coatings with different Si content, the average friction coefficient was maintained around 0.35–0.45. The highest hardness of Cr–Si–N coatings with Si content of 6.94at% can be attributed to limited dislocation activity in nano-crystals and suppression of grain boundary sliding.","Huang, Lingling;Zou, Changwei;Xie, Wei;Peng, Feng;Shao, Lexi",2016-03-31,Ceramics International,"Cr–Si–N coatings,Si contents,Nanocomposite structure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.12.019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.12.019

In this study, a heater coating was developed using a combination of a thermally sprayed NiAl bonding layer, an MgAl2O4 insulating layer, and an MoSi2-based conductive layer; for comparison, an optional thin MgAl2O4 top layer was applied to provide corrosion and wear protection. The microstructures and characteristics, particularly the electrical-thermal performance, were systematically investigated. The MgAl2O4 layer was found to provide excellent high-temperature insulation performance. Thermo-cycling tests indicate the MoSi2-based coating can be heated to 320 °C with a relatively uniform temperature distribution at the roller surface. The addition of the top layer as a protective mask is beneficial to the heating stability, and NiCr added as a bonding phase in the conductive layer significantly improves the electrical-thermal performance.","Yang, Kun;Zhou, Yan-Zhe;Liu, Min;Song, Jin-Bing;Deng, Chun-Ming",2020-11-30,Ceramics International,"Heater coating,MoSi2,Plasma spray,Electrical-thermal performance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.013
Influence of heat treatment on alternant-layer structure and mechanical properties of Al2O3-TiO2-MgO coatings,"Al2O3-TiO2-MgO ceramic alternant layer coatings were prepared by atmospheric plasma spraying and heat treated at 600, 700, 800, 900, and 1000 °C. The influence of heat treatment on microhardness, fracture toughness, and the structural evolution of the coatings on steel were investigated. Heat treatment promoted alternant layer interdiffusion within ceramic coatings, which could result a transformation from a lamellar morphology to mutual pinning. The interfacial diffusion between the bond coating and substrate was clearly demonstrated after heat treatment at different temperatures. Heat treatment also significantly affected the evolution of the hardness and fracture toughness. Temperature strongly affected the microhardness of the specimens, and the hardness arrived to the highest value at 1000 °C. The formation of a new Mg2Al6Ti7O25 phase and alternant layer mutual pinning were beneficial to hardness improvement, and heat treatment also significantly improved fracture toughness.","Chen, Kunlun;Song, Peng;Li, Chao;Zhou, Ying;He, Xuan;Yu, Xiao;Lu, Jiansheng",2018-08-15,Ceramics International,"Al2O3-TiO2-MgO,Heat treatment,Coating,Diffusion,Mechanical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.214,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.214
Controlled synthesis of L-cysteine coated cobalt ferrite nanoparticles for drug delivery,"In the present work, we reported a facile synthesis of cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) nanoparticles in the presence of L-cysteine (Lys). The morphology and size of samples were characterized by SEM and TEM. The successful coating of Lys on the surface of CoFe2O4 was confirmed by XRD, XPS and TGA. The investigation of magnetic properties showed that both bare CoFe2O4 and Lys-coated CoFe2O4 nanoparticles exhibited room-temperature superparamagnetic behavior. The results of MTT experiments revealed insignificant cytotoxicity of Lys-coated CoFe2O4 nanoparticles even after 24 h incubation. More importantly, Lys-coated CoFe2O4 nanoparticles displayed an excellent drug loading capacity and a pH-sensitive drug release behavior. In summary, the prepared Lys-coated CoFe2O4 nanoparticles demonstrated a promising application potential in controlled drug delivery.","Wang, Guangshuo;Zhou, Fei;Li, Xiaoguang;Li, Jinlin;Ma, Yingying;Mu, Jingbo;Zhang, Zhixiao;Che, Hongwei;Zhang, Xiaoliang",2018-08-15,Ceramics International,"Cobalt ferrite,L-cysteine,Superparamagnetic,Biocompatible,Controlled drug delivery",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.193,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.193
Improvement of the conductivity of sol-gel derived Li-La-Zr-O thin films by the addition of surfactant,"Li–La–Zr–O thin films were successfully fabricated using the sol-gel spin coating method and the effects of the addition of surfactant in the solution were studied. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and Atomic Force Microscope were used to investigate the characteristics of these films and an amorphous structure and smooth surface on the films were revealed. The ionic conductivity of the film was investigated by impedance analysis. The results showed that the room-temperature ionic conductivity of the film increases with the content of surfactant, from 1.8 × 10−6 S/cm for 0.5wt% to 3.9 × 10−6 S/cm for 1.5wt%. However, further increasing the content of surfactant can deteriorate the property of the thin film on the contrary. The improvement of the property can be attributed to the improvement of the morphology of the film. We propose that this Li–La–Zr–O thin film is a promising solid electrolyte for thin-film lithium-ion batteries.","Chen, Ru-Jun;Zhang, Yi-Bo;Liu, Ting;Xu, Bing-Qing;Shen, Yang;Lin, Yuan-Hua;Nan, Ce-Wen",2017-08-31,Ceramics International,"Batteries,Sol-gel process,Films,Ionic conductivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.201,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.201
Improvement the electrochemical performance of Cr doped layered-spinel composite cathode material Li1.1Ni0.235Mn0.735Cr0.03O2.3 with Li4Ti5O12 coating,"The Cr doped layered-spinel composite cathode material Li1.1Ni0.235Mn0.735Cr0.03O2.3 was synthesized and coated with different content of Li4Ti5O12 by a sol–gel method. The materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The effect of Li4Ti5O12 coatings on the electrochemical performance of the pristine material was evaluated from charge/discharge cycles, rate performance, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The XRD results show that the lattice crystal and the content of spinel phase have been increased in the Li1.1Ni0.235Mn0.735Cr0.03O2.3 materials after Li4Ti5O12 coating. The results from TEM and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) indicate that the Li4Ti5O12 coating assumes a spinel structure on the Li1.1Ni0.235Mn0.735Cr0.03O2.3. The discharge capacities, cycling and rate performances of the Li1.1Ni0.235Mn0.735Cr0.03O2.3 materials in the first cycle are improved with the addition of Li4Ti5O12. Li1.1Ni0.235Mn0.735Cr0.03O2.3 coated with 3wt% Li4Ti5O12 shows the highest discharge capacity (271.7mAhg−1), highest capacity retention (99.4% for 100 cycles), and best rate capability (132mAhg−1 at 10C). EIS result indicates that the resistance of Li1.1Ni0.235Mn0.735Cr0.03O2.3 electrode decreases with the addition of Li4Ti5O12. The enhanced electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the increased spinel content, lower resistance and the enhanced lithium-ion diffusion kinetics.","Liu, Yunjian;Zheng, Shengquan;Wang, Qiliang;Fu, Yanbao;Wan, Huafeng;Dou, Aichun;Battaglia, Vincent S.;Su, Mingru",2017-08-15,Ceramics International,"Lithium cathode material,Layered-spinel composite,Cr doped,Surface coating,Electrochemical performance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.011
Kinetics and oxidation behavior of laser clad WC-Co and Ni/WC-Co coatings,"In this study, the oxidation behavior of WC-12Co and electroless Ni/WC-Co coatings is investigated by Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Time dependence of weight gain showed a linear behavior for WC-Co coating and a parabolic-like behavior for Ni/WC-Co coating. This behavior is related to the reaction-controlled and diffusion-controlled oxidation processes in the WC-Co and Ni/WC-Co coatings, respectively. Oxidation resistance of coatings was determined by phase composition and formation mechanism of the protective oxide layer. The results demonstrated that the use of Ni/WC-Co powder could reduce significantly the porosity and cracks and lead to a compact and protective (Ni, Co)WO4 layer. The apparent activation energy was measured to be about 98.3 and 229.4 kJ/mol for WC-Co and Ni/WC-Co coatings, respectively.","Erfanmanesh, Mohammad;Abdollah-Pour, Hassan;Mohammadian-Semnani, Hamidreza;Shoja-Razavi, Reza",2018-08-01,Ceramics International,"Ni/WC-Co,Electroless nickel plating,Oxidation,Kinetic,Laser cladding",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.087,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.087
Preparation and characterization of Fe2O3 coating on quartz fabric by electron beam evaporation,"Iron III oxide (Fe2O3) nanoparticles were coated on quartz fabric by electron beam evaporation (EBE) and then annealed in a muffle furnace under air atmosphere at 800°C for 5h. The Fe2O3 coated fabric is characterized by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The thickness and color performance of the Fe2O3 film on the quartz fabric were measured with a surface profiler and color spectrophotometer, respectively. It is found that an increase of electron beam currents from 20mA to 60mA results in an increase of color depth of the coated fabric. The color of the Fe2O3 coated quartz fabric is reddish yellow and changes to red after annealing. The thickness of the Fe2O3 film also increases with the rise of electron beam current.","Jiang, Shouxiang;Peng, Linghui;Guo, Ronghui;Miao, Dagang;Shang, Songmin;Xu, Jiangtao;Li, Aishu",2016-12-31,Ceramics International,"Quartz fabric,Electron beam evaporation,Fe2O3,Color performance,Annealing",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.09.111,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.09.111
Electrophoretic deposition of bioactive glass nanopowders on magnesium based alloy for biomedical applications,"To slow down the initial biodegradation rate of magnesium (Mg) alloy, crystalline nano-sized bioactive glass coating was used to deposit on micro-arc oxidized AZ91 samples via electrophoretic deposition (EPD). Zeta potential and conductivity of the bioactive glass suspension were characterized at various pH values to identify the most stable dispersion conditions. The bone-bonding properties of bioactive glass coated samples were evaluated in terms of apatite-forming ability during the immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF) solution. Results revealed that the ability to form a bioactive glass coating via EPD was influenced by the degree of its crystalline phase composition. Moreover, the potentiodynamic polarization tests recorded significant drops in corrosion current density and corrosion rate of the coated samples which implies a good level of corrosion protective behavior. These preliminary results show that this process will enable the development of Mg implants in the later stage of bone healing.","Rojaee, Ramin;Fathi, Mohammadhossein;Raeissi, Keyvan;Taherian, Mohamadhassan",2014-07-31,Ceramics International,"Magnesium,Biodegradable implants,Bioactive glass,Electrophoretic deposition",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.12.135,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.12.135
Enhanced electrochemical performance of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode materials via Li4P2O7 surface modification for Li-ion batteries,"The performance of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode materials has been significantly improved by Li4P2O7 surface modification. Some electrochemical tests are carried out to investigate the relevant performances of LiH2PO4-coated LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, such as inductively coupled plasma test (ICP), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results indicate that LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 is clad with a layer of average thickness about 30–40 nm. And the alkalinity on the surface of the modified materials has declined dramatically after titration measurement. The effect of surface modification can be credited to the two main factors: On the one hand, the weak acidity of LiH2PO4 neutralizes the lithium residues (LiOH/Li2CO3) on the surface of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode materials; on the other hand, LiH2PO4 continues to decompose and react with the unneutralized lithium residues to generate a coating layer of Li4P2O7 during the annealing process, which can prevent the active materials from contacting with the electrolyte directly and act as an outstanding Li+ conductor, thus inhibiting the interface reaction and improving the cycle performance as well as the rate properties of the host materials.","Hu, Kaihua;Qi, Xianyue;Lu, Caifeng;Du, Ke;Peng, Zhongdong;Cao, Yanbing;Hu, Guorong",2018-08-15,Ceramics International,"Li-ion batteries,LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2,Li4P2O7 surface modification,Cycle performance,Rate properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.024,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.024

The RL of a composite absorber with thickness of 3.5 mm reached a maximum value of − 25.6 dB. And the absorption bandwidth for RL < −10 dB was 7.24 GHz in the frequency range from 7.12 to 14.36 GHz.

Application of sonochemical processing to LSC(La0.6Sr0.4CoO3)/SDC(Sm2O3-doped CeO2) composite cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells involving CeO2-based electrolytes,Nanocrystalline Sm2O3-Doped CeO2 (SDC) powders were synthesized in a single- and two-phase material system by using sonochemical processing with high-frequency agitation. The synthesized SDC nanocrystalline powders were used to coat the mixed-conducting La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 (LSC) cathode materials. The combined synthesis processing allows the artificial coating of the LSC materials with the ionic-conducting SDC electrolyte. The electrochemical polarizations of the SDC/LSC composites are characterized using a geometrically constricted contact between the ionic probe and the SDC/LSC composites. The lowest cathode polarization was obtained for the LSC (85wt%)/SDC (15wt%). The lowest electrode polarization is believed to result from the high density of the triple-phase boundaries when the constituent phases are interconnected in a 3-dimensional manner.,"Ko, Myeong-Hee;Hwang, Jin-Ha",2016-08-01,Ceramics International,"Sonochemical processing,Composite cathodes,Solid oxide fuel cells,CeO2-based electrolytes,Impedance spectroscopy",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.005
Microstructures and tribological properties of vacuum plasma sprayed B4C–Ni composite coatings,"A promising wear resistant coating has been fabricated via vacuum plasma spray (VPS) technique by using electroless plating composite powders comprised of B4C and different amounts of Ni (10 and 20vol.%). Tribological evaluation from the ball-on-disk test showed that the wear resistance of the composite coatings was superior to that of the pure B4C coating, and the composite deposit containing 10vol.% Ni demonstrated the optimum tribological properties. This mainly attributed to the more uniform microstructures of the composite coatings, and the higher thermal conductivity of the composite coating also contributed to its distinguished wear behaviors. For the coatings investigated, the dominant wear mechanism was determined to be oxidation and the formation of a transfer layer on the worn surface.","Zhu, Huiying;Niu, Yaran;Lin, Chucheng;Huang, Liping;Ji, Heng;Zheng, Xuebin",2013-01-31,Ceramics International,"B4C–Ni composite coating,Sliding wear,Vacuum plasma spraying",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.05.101,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.05.101
A double layer nanostructure SiC coating for anti-oxidation protection of carbon/carbon composites prepared by chemical vapor reaction and chemical vapor deposition,"A double layer nanostructure SiC coating was prepared by chemical vapor reaction and chemical vapor deposition to protect carbon/carbon composites from oxidation. The obtained dense coating reveals a typical crystalline structure and combines well with the substrate. The outer layer of the coating consists of SiC nanocrystals and nanowires, whereas the inner layer is mainly composed of SiC microcrystals, nanocrystals and nanowires. The oxidation and cyclic thermal shock test performed at 1400°C in air demonstrates that the prepared dense nanostructure coating has excellent anti-oxidation behavior and thermal shock resistance at high temperature. After 400h oxidation and 34cycles of thermal shock from 1400°C to room temperature, the weight loss of the coated sample is only 1.67%. In the oxidation process, the amorphous silica formed at the beginning of the oxidation crystallizes to cristobalite as oxidation time increased. The formation of cristobalite resulted in micro-cracks formed along grain boundaries in the cyclic thermal shock test. As only cracks are formed on the coating surface, it can be concluded that the formation of the penetration cracks may be the reason for the weight loss of the SiC coated composite.","Yang, Xin;Huang, Qizhong;Su, Zhean;Chai, Liyuan;Wang, Xiufei;Zhou, Leping",2013-07-31,Ceramics International,"D.

Corrosion behavior of volcanic ash on sintered mullite for environmental barrier coatings,"The high-temperature corrosion behavior of volcanic ash(VA) in attacking sintered mullite was investigated, and the corrosion resistibility of mullite environmental barrier coatings (EBCs) to VA was predicted. Sintered mullite specimens were prepared by using the spark plasma sintering method. These specimens were subjected to a hot corrosive environment—molten Icelandic VA at 1400°C—for three different duration times (2, 12, and 48h). The microstructure and phase of the specimens were analyzed by using a scanning electron microscope equipped with an accessory system for energy dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. In addition, in-situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction was carried out to identify the dynamics of phase evaluation in the volcanic ash and mullite mixture powders. Results show that a reaction layer was generated and continuously dissolved into the melted volcanic ash. The primary incursive component is iron; however, a minimal amount of sodium plays a more important role in disintegrating sintered mullite.","Jang, Byung-Koog;Feng, Fan-Jie;Suzuta, Keiko;Tanaka, Hidehiko;Matsushita, Yoshitaka;Lee, Kee Sung;Kim, Seongwon;Oh, Yoon-Suk;Kim, Hyung-Tae",2017-02-01,Ceramics International,"Environmental barrier coatings,Spark plasma sintering,Mullite,Volcanic ash,Corrosion behavior",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.147,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.147
Self-lubricating TiN/MoN and TiAlN/MoN nano-multilayer coatings for drilling of austenitic stainless steel,"Self-lubricating TiN/MoN and TiAlN/MoN nano-multilayer coatings were fabricated on the HSS drills by a closed field unbalanced magnetron sputtering system. The as-deposited TiN/MoN and TiAlN/MoN nano-multilayer coatings exhibit a face-centered cubic structure with (200) and (111) preferred orientation, respectively. The TiN/MoN coating possessed higher hardness of 31 GPa than that of TiAlN/MoN coating (21GPa). Both of the TiN/MoN and TiAlN/MoN coating exhibit low coefficient of friction with values of about 0.32. The cutting force and temperature of cutting edge of TiN/MoN and TiAlN/MoN coated drills were remarkably decreased compared to uncoated drills during the dry drilling test in austenitic stainless steel. The numbers of drilling holes of TiN/MoN and TiAlN/MoN coated drills were 4.2 and 2.4 times larger than that of uncoated HSS drills. The build-up edge was avoided on TiN/MoN and TiAlN/MoN coated drills which resulted in better surface quality of drilled holes compared to uncoated HSS drills.","Wang, Tao;Zhang, Jia;Li, Yan;Gao, Feng;Zhang, Guojun",2019-12-15,Ceramics International,"TiN/MoN coatings,TiAlN/MoN coatings,Cutting performance,Self-lubricating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.136,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.136
Comparison of stress evolution under TGO growth simulated by two different methods in thermal barrier coatings,"The growth of thermally grown oxide (TGO) is a significant factor affecting the failure mechanism of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) during cyclic high temperature service. In this work, a complicated finite element model with two semicircles reflecting the undulation of TGO interfaces was proposed, and four representative shapes of TGO interfaces were selected. There are mainly two methods to simulate TGO growth under high temperature, and each method was achieved by implementation of user subroutines in finite element method. A total of 100 thermal cycle loads were applied to the TBCs continuously. The stress evolution in the layers of Top Ceramic Coating (TC) and Bond Coating (BC) at the end of each thermal cycle load was obtained, the influence of TGO growth on stress evolution was analyzed, the differences between two methods of TGO growth were discussed. The results show that under TGO growth simulated by the first method, the stress distribution in the y direction does not change in both TC and BC layer, and the maximum stress decreases a lot in TC layer but nearly remains the same in BC. When the growth of TGO was simulated by the second method, stress evolution is complex and undergoes up to five stages with a small undulation or convex of TGO interfaces. Stress evolution in BC layer remains as the same as in the first method. Moreover, the maximum stress increases continually in BC layer. The comparison of these two simulation method would help to study the failure of TBCs caused by TGO growth.","Chen, Zhi;Jia, Wenbin;Zhao, Kai;Fang, Lei",2020-02-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,TGO growth,Stress evolution",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.286,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.286
Hybrid SiO2–ZrO2 coatings for restoring and repairing glasses damaged by sandblasting,"The purpose of this work was to study the repairing of defect produced by sandstorms on the surface of car windshields and solar panels, by deposition of thin transparent sol-gel layers. Different silica-zirconia films (100-x SiO2 - x ZrO2, x = (10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 mol %) were prepared by the sol–gel process using TEOS and MTES as silica precursors and incorporating two different colloidal suspensions with silica or zirconia nanoparticles. The silica-zirconia sols were deposited by dip coating on soda-lime glass samples previously eroded by sandblasting. Film thickness and homogeneity were evaluated by ellipsometry and AFM, and the optical and mechanical properties were studied by UV–vis spectroscopy, the hardness by microhardness, and the roughness by tactile profilometer. The sol-gel coatings present a good quality and are able to restore the optical and mechanical properties of sandblasted samples thus increasing the service life. The incorporation of zirconia particles to SiO2 coatings increases the refractive index, from 1.42 to 1.57. Moreover, optical transmission of coated samples increases from 91.4 to 93% for 90SiO2–10ZrO2 coatings, and increases from 80% for eroded samples (Mp = 200 g) coated with SiO2–ZrO2 films up to 91% while micro-hardness is greatly improved from 10.17 GPa for the raw material to 17.62 GPa for 70SiO2–30ZrO2 coated sample.","Ayadi, A.;Bouaouadja, N.;Durán, A.;Castro, Y.",2020-06-01,Ceramics International,"Glass,SiO2–ZrO2 sol-gel coating,Sandblasting,Repairing",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.067,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.067
Effect of MoSi2 addition on ablation behavior of ZrC coating fabricated by vacuum plasma spray,"To improve the ablation resistance of ZrC coating, MoSi2 incorporated ZrC composite coatings were fabricated by vacuum plasma spray. The ablation resistance of the composite coatings was evaluated using a plasma jet with a heat flux of 1.94 MW/m2. The phase compositions and microstructures of the coatings before and after ablation were investigated, and the ablation mechanisms and effect of MoSi2 were analyzed based on thermal dynamics and microstructure changes. Results showed that MoSi2 addition could improve the ablation resistance of ZrC coating by means of decreasing the surface temperature and changing the microstructure of the oxidation layer. Si derived from the decomposition of MoSi2, which occurred within coating, was beneficial to maintain the thickness and integrity of the SiO2 layer and reduce the oxygen pressure beneath. The thickness of the SiO2 layer was related to the formation rate (Vf) and the consumption rate (Vc) of SiO2. The diffusion of Si was in favor of increasing the value of Vf. MoSi2 could be one choice to improve the ablation resistance of the ZrC coating.","Liu, Tao;Niu, Yaran;Li, Chong;Zhao, Jun;Zhang, Jimei;Zeng, Yi;Zheng, Xuebin;Ding, Chuanxian",2018-06-01,Ceramics International,"ZrC coating,MoSi2 addition,Ablation resistance,Oxidation layer,Vacuum plasma spray",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.093,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.093
Fabrication of SiC reticulated porous ceramics with multi-layered struts for porous media combustion,"Silicon carbide reticulated porous ceramics (SiC RPCs) with multi-layered struts were fabricated at 1450°C by polymer sponge replica technique, followed by vacuum infiltration. The effect of additives (polycarboxylate, ammonium lignosulfonate and sodium carboxymethyl-cellulose) on the rheological behavior of silicon carbide slurry was firstly investigated, and then the slurry was coated on polyurethane open-cell sponge template. Furthermore, alumina slurry was adopted to fill up the hollow struts in vacuum infiltration process after the coated sponge was pre-treated at 850°C. The results showed that the coating thickness on the struts and the microstructure in SiC RPCs were closely associated with the solid content of alumina slurry during vacuum infiltration. The typical multi-layered strut of SiC RPCs could be achieved after the infiltration of an alumina slurry containing 77wt% solid content. The compressive strength and thermal shock resistance of the infiltrated specimens were significantly improved in comparison with those of non-infiltrated ones. The improvement was attributed to the in-situ formation of reaction-bonded multilayer struts in SiC RPCs, which were characterized by the exterior coating of aluminosilicate-corundum, middle part of mullite bonded SiC and interior zone of corundum.","Liang, Xiong;Li, Yawei;Liu, Jun;Sang, Shaobai;Chen, Yuanyuan;Li, Benwen;Aneziris, Christos G.",2016-08-15,Ceramics International,"SiC reticulated porous ceramics,Rheological properties,Multi-layered struts,Mechanical properties,Thermal shock resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.093,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.093
Vertical MoS2 nanosheets arrays on carbon cloth as binder-free and flexible electrode for high-performance all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor,"Supercapacitors are considered to be a new promising green energy storage device owing to their excellent long cycle life. Compared with the conventional coating technique, the strategy of self-growing electrode materials on highly flexible collectors have become a new development trend. A binder-free and flexible electrode composed of vertical MoS2 nanosheets arrays on carbon cloth was obtained via a convenient hydrothermal method. Carbon cloth, as a supporting substrate, effectively avoids the agglomeration of MoS2 nanosheets and exposes more electrochemical active sites. The construction of binder-free electrode is an effective way to improve the electrochemical performance, which makes ions transfer faster. As a result, MoS2 nanosheets arrays decorated carbon cloth shows high areal capacitance (2236.6 mF cm−2 at 10 mA cm−2) with favorable cycle stability (86.1% after 2000 cycles). To further explore the practical application of supercapacitors, symmetric coin cell (SCC) and all-solid-state supercapacitors (ASC) were assembled using MoS2/CC as working electrode.

XRD, AES, SEM, DSC-TG-MS techniques were used to characterize the coated composite particles. It was found that a core-shell structure is constructed in the coated Cu/SiC composite particles with the core of SiC and the shell of Cu. A new layer of Cu2O is created on the surface of the coated particles due to the oxidation of nano Cu crystallites. The expected sintering temperature for the coated Cu/SiC composite particles is below 950 °C.","Zhang, Rui;Gao, Lian;Guo, Jingkun",2004-12-31,Ceramics International,"A. Sintering,B. Nanocomposites,D.

Surface modification of coked alumina refractories by the deposition of sol-gel derived silica coatings,"In this work Cu, Sn, and Ti nanoparticles were incorporated into solutions for the sol-gel deposition of silica coatings on coked alumina substrates. CuSnTi ternary alloys were used aiming to improve the chemical affinity between silica and water. After heat treatment in an argon atmosphere, the coating adherence on samples was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), scratch, and tape tests. The wettability behavior of the prepared materials was also investigated. It was observed that the presence of silica coatings on coked substrates increased their affinity for water. It is an important result since the hydrophobic behavior of coked linings inhibits the deposition of repair materials on their surface, which decreases their life sDpan and leads to financial losses in petrochemical applications. Evaluation of the samples by SEM indicated the presence of a nearly uniform silica film on the coated substrates. Moreover, tape and scratch tests indicated that there was good adhesion between the silica coatings and alumina substrate because no delamination or peeling was observed in these tests. The use of a CuSnTi alloy composed of 60 wt%Cu−35 wt%Sn−5 wt%Ti led to smoother materials when compared to a 40 wt%Cu−50 wt%Sn−10 wt%Ti alloy. Nonetheless, no difference in terms of roughness was noticed for specimens heat treated at 110, 750 or 1050 °C.","Campos, Karina S.;Lenz e Silva, Guilherme F.B.;Nunes, Eduardo H.M.;Silva, Alysson M.A.;Bestard, Guillermo A.;Vasconcelos, Wander Luiz",2019-05-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Preparation of ultra-fine Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 powder by a novel solid state reaction and fabrication of dense Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 electrolyte film,"A novel solid state reaction was adopted to prepare Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) powder. A mixed oxalate Sm0.2Ce0.8(C2O4)1.5·2H2O was synthesized by milling a mixture of cerium acetate hydrate, samarium acetate hydrate, and oxalic acid for 5h at room temperature. An ultra-fine SDC powder with the primary particle size of 5.5nm was obtained at 300°C. The ultra-low temperature for the formation of SDC phase was due to the atomic level mixture of the Sm3+ and Ce4+ ions. The crystal sizes of SDC powders at 300°C, 550°C, 800°C, and 1050°C were 5.5nm, 11.4nm, 24.1nm and 37.5nm, respectively. The sintering curves showed that the powder calcined at lower temperature was easier to be sintered owning to its smaller particle size. A solid oxide electrolytic cell (SOEC), comprising porous La0.8Sr0.2Cu0.1Fe0.9O3−δ (LSCF) for substrate, LSCF–SDC for active electrode, SDC for electrolyte, and LSCF–SDC for symmetric electrode, was fabricated by dip-coating and co-sintering techniques. An extremely dense SDC film with the thickness of 20μm was obtained at only 1200°C, which was about 100–300°C lower than the literatures׳ reports. The designed SOEC was proved to work effectively for decomposing NO (3500ppm, balanced in N2), 80% NO can be decomposed at 600°C.","Zhao, B.;Tong, Y.;Zhao, Y.;Yang, T.;Yang, F.;Hu, Q.;Zhao, C.",2015-09-30,Ceramics International,"Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 powder,Solid-state reaction,Solid oxide electrolytic cell,NO decomposition",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.04.037,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.04.037
Self-lubrication and wear-resistance mechanism of graphene-modified coatings,"To reduce the friction coefficient of WC-17Co wear-resistant coatings, Graphene oxide were used to mix with WC-17Co powder. The SEM, EDS and Raman results were used to analyze the morphology and phase composition of graphene oxide in the powder and coating obtained by plasma spraying processes. The mechanical properties of the coatings were studied by using a microhardness tester and a universal testing machine. The friction and wear properties of the coatings were studied by using a UMT-2 friction and wear tester. The results show that among the pulverization processes, the spray granulation process can achieve a stronger and more uniform adhesion of graphene oxide on the surface of WC-17Co particles, and the graphene oxide content in the coating is higher. Graphene is still embedded in the coating as transparent, thin sheets. The bonding strength is approximately 63 MPa, the hardness is approximately 931 HV0.1, and the friction coefficient of the graphene oxide coating is reduced by approximately 22% compared to that of the coating without graphene. The formation of lubrication films in the micro-area improves the self-lubrication and antiwear effects.","Shu ai, Zhang;Xiao feng, Gong;Ren ping, Yu;Qin, Xing;Ling ping, Xu;Zhong xun, Wang",2020-07-31,Ceramics International,"Powder making process,Plasma spraying,Graphene oxide,Self-lubrication,Wear resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.140,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.140
"Tailoring the magnetic hyperthermia performances of gram-bean-extract-mediated highly disperse MFe2O4 (M = Fe, Ni, Mn) nanoferrites","Magnetic hyperthermia requires a long duration of stable therapeutic temperature (43–46 °C). Because temperature kinetics mainly depends on the Brownian and Néel relaxation losses of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), a thorough control of these losses is essential. This can be achieved by controlling the size, shape, and surface passivation of MNPs. Although extensive studies have been conducted to develop such NPs, a bulk-yield synthesis of highly stable MNPs maintaining stable therapeutic temperatures for a long duration has not been reported. We used an efficient gram-bean-extract-(GBE)-mediated hydrothermal synthesis to obtain a uniform phase-stable bulk production of magnetic nanoferrites, Fe3O4, NiFe2O4, and MnFe2O4 that were smaller than 20 nm. The temperature kinetic plots (TKPs) of the as-hydrothermally (without GBE) synthesized NiFe2O4 and MnFe2O4 NPs (>20 nm) showed a non-adiabatic increasing trend, which exceeded the safe hyperthermia temperature zone (HTZ; 43–46 °C). On the contrary, the GBE-mediated MNPs, particularly MnFe2O4, had faster plateaus earlier in the TKPs, providing the necessary stable HTZ for more than half of the induction heating time. The pectin coatings (from the GBE) on the MNPs passivated the surfaces (preventing oxidation) and reduced the frictional losses (Brownian), which yielded the temperature plateau and stable HTZ at a longer duration. Therefore, the GBE-mediated hydrothermal route can tune the hyperthermia performances to achieve a highly stable HTZ.","Koli, Rohit R.;Deshpande, Nishad G.;Kim, Dong Su;Shelke, Abhijeet R.;Fulari, Akash V.;Fulari, Vijay J.;Cho, Hyung Koun",2020-10-15,Ceramics International,"Nanoferrite,Green synthesis,Magnetic properties,Hyperthermia",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.210,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.210
Bioglass®-based scaffolds incorporating polycaprolactone and chitosan coatings for controlled vancomycin delivery,"Highly porous scaffolds have been fabricated by the replication technique using 45S5 Bioglass® (BG) powder. For the purpose of imparting a local drug release capability, the scaffolds were coated with polycaprolactone and vancomycin-loaded chitosan by a two-step procedure. Bare BG scaffolds loaded with vancomycin via a direct immersion method were used as control. The chemical composition and microstructure of bare and coated scaffolds were characterized through Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. The mechanical properties of the coated scaffolds were significantly improved compared with uncoated scaffolds; the compressive strength values of the coated scaffolds were about 3 times and the area under the stress–strain curve was about 7 times higher than those of the uncoated scaffolds. The scaffolds degradation behavior and the drug release profiles were studied in a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution. There was a sharp release of the drug in the first few hours (8h) for both bare and coated scaffolds. For the bare scaffolds the drug was released completely in 24h. However, the coated scaffolds showed a sustained release in a period of 11 days, suggesting the potential of the present polymer coated BG scaffolds to be used as bone tissue scaffolds with drug carrier and delivery ability.","Yao, Qingqing;Nooeaid, Patcharakamon;Roether, Judith A.;Dong, Yanming;Zhang, Qiqing;Boccaccini, Aldo R.",2013-09-30,Ceramics International,"Bioactive glass,Scaffolds,Drug delivery,Tissue engineering",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.03.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.03.002
Microstructure and electromagnetic wave absorption property of reduced graphene oxide-SiCnw/SiBCN composite ceramics,"In this account, RGO-SiCnw/SiBCN composite ceramics were fabricated using polymer derived ceramic (PDC) combined with chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) technology. Dielectric property of as-obtained RGO-SiCnw/SiBCN composite ceramics was significantly enhanced thanks to established conductive pathway through overlapped nanoscale SiCnw and micro-sized RGO. The minimum RC of composite ceramics with 0.5 wt% GO and 2.29 wt% SiCnw at thickness of 3.6 mm reached -42.02 dB with corresponding effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 4.2 GHz. As temperature rose from 25 to 400 °C, permittivity increased with enhanced charge carrier density and then it decreased due to oxidation process of RGO from 400 to 600 °C. The minimum reflection coefficient (RC) was recorded as -39.13 dB and EAB covered the entire X-band at 600 °C. EMW absorption ability was evaluated after high-temperature oxidation experiment under protective effect of wave-transparent Si3N4 coating. RGO-SiCnw/SiBCN composite ceramics maintained outstanding EMW absorption ability with minimum RC of -10.41 dB after oxidation at 900 °C, indicating RGO-SiCnw/SiBCN composite ceramics with excellent EMW absorption characteristic even at high temperatures and harsh environments.","Song, Chaokun;Liu, Yongsheng;Ye, Fang;Wang, Jing;Cheng, Laifei",2020-04-15,Ceramics International,"RGO-SiCnw/SiBCN,PDC,CVI,Dielectric property,Electrimagnetic wave absorption characteristic",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.275,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.275
A comparative study of the mechanical and tribological properties of PECVD single layer and compositionally graded TiSiCN coatings,"In this study, TiSiCN coatings, with and without a Ti/TiN/TiCN interlayer, are deposited on tempered and plasma-nitrided H13 hot-working tool steel substrate by pulsed direct current plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The self-lubricant super hard TiSiCN coatings have a nanocomposite structure consisting of an amorphous SiCN matrix embedding TiCN nanocrystals. In the presence of the graded interlayer, coating adhesion improves significantly, as revealed by a 40% increase of the critical load for adhesion failure in scratch testing of the coated samples. The formation of shorter radial cracks around the indentation zone during Rockwell C indentation test reveals that the coating with the graded interlayer has a higher toughness compared to the single layer coating. The wear rate of the graded coating is found to be about three times lower than that of the single layer coating, which can be attributed to the higher hardness, better adhesion to the substrate and higher toughness of the graded coating.","Abedi, Mohammad;Abdollah-zadeh, Amir;Vicenzo, Antonello;Bestetti, Massimiliano;Movassagh-Alanagh, Farid;Damerchi, Elyad",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Nanocomposite coating,Superhard coating,Chemical vapor deposition,Graded structure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.100,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.100
Dual carbon-confined Na2MnPO4F nanoparticles as a superior cathode for rechargeable sodium-ion battery,"Na2MnPO4F has drawn worldwide attention as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries with great promise due to its high theoretical capacity (124 mAh g−1) and working voltage plateau (3.6 V). Unfortunately, its electrochemical performances are largely limited by the intrinsic low electron conductivity and sluggish diffusion of Na+. Herein, a reduced graphite oxide nanosheets and nano-carbon co-modified Na2MnPO4F nanocomposite is prepared via a simple hydrothermal method. And the composite possesses a three-dimensional “pellets-on-sheets” structure, in which core-shell structured nanoparticles (Na2MnPO4F nanoparticles coated by carbon coating layers) are uniformly anchored on the surface of well-dispersed reduced graphite oxide nanosheets. Such unique structure is favorable for fast Na+ and electron transports and supplies sufficient active sites for Na+ insertion. As the cathode of sodium-ion battery, the as-prepared dual carbon-modified Na2MnPO4F composite exhibits a super discharge capacity of 122 mAh g−1 at 0.05 C and high rate-performance (42 mAh g−1 at 2 C) as well as long cycle performance (77% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 0.1 C). Meanwhile, it presents two obvious potential platforms of about 3.7 V and 3.5 V during the charge and discharge process, respectively, revealing its potential applications in high energy density batteries.","Ling, Rui;Cai, Shu;Shen, Kaier;Sang, Zhiyuan;Xie, Dongli;Sun, Jiayue;Xiong, Kunzhou;Guo, Jinze;Sun, Xiaohong",2019-11-30,Ceramics International,"Na2MnPO4F/C-rGO,Sodium-ion battery,Pellets-on-sheets structure,High potential platforms",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.235,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.235
Dominant effects of 2D pores on mechanical behaviors of plasma sprayed ceramic coatings during thermal exposure,"Realizing engineering application of new candidate ceramic materials is highly required for the development of advanced thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). In addition to the optimization of intrinsic properties of ceramic materials, a feasible way is to tailor the structure of coatings based on the understanding of structure-properties evolution during thermal exposure. Herein, the unique sintering behavior and the consequent effect on spallation of plasma sprayed coatings made of a candidate material, i.e., La2Zr2O7 (LZO), were investigated by experiments and simulation. Experimental results showed that significant changes occurred for the porosity, 2D pore density and hardness during thermal exposure. The 2D pores are the essential microstructural characteristics and are dominantly responsible for the changes of mechanical property. Simulation results suggested that the healing of 2D pores increase the driving force for crack extension. This is the main cause for the spallation of ceramic top coat during thermal cyclic test. Finally, some structural designs towards long lifetime of TBCs were discussed. The dominant effects of 2D pores on mechanical properties and failure of TBCs provide fundamental understanding to the structural tailoring of advanced TBCs for future applications.","Wang, Li-Shuang;Tang, Chun-Hua;Dong, Hui;Li, Guang-Rong;Yang, Guan-Jun",2020-04-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,La2Zr2O7,2D pores,Mechanical properties,Structural design",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.168,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.168
The superlattice structure and self-adaptive performance of C–Ti/MoS2 composite coatings,"To improve the self-adaptability of MoS2 coating in different environments, the coatings were doped with functional C and Ti by unbalanced magnetron sputtering system. The clear superlattice structure with minimal modulation period was investigated by High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM). The co-doped coatings have better mechanical properties due to the special structure and the formation of C–Mo, Ti–S and Ti–O bonds, and better lubrication performance in both high humidity and vacuum than those of the single-doped ones. The doped Ti not only facilitates the formation of the MoS2 (002) basal plane, but also improves the oxidation resistance of the composite film. The degree of friction-induced graphitization on the wear tracks and the quality of transfer films on the wear scars are key factors affecting the lubrication performance of the composite film. In the high-humidity environment, the reasonable doping elements can promote the formation the high-quality transfer film by interacting with H2O water molecules, which will benefit the lubrication of the coating better. Our findings deepen the understanding of MoS2 composite coating and provide a new solution for improving the self-adaptability of the coating.","Li, Li;Lu, Zhaoxia;Pu, Jibin;Wang, Haixin;Li, Qiang;Chen, Shibo;Zhang, Zhifeng;Wang, Liping",2020-04-01,Ceramics International,"Self-adaptive,C–Ti/MoS2 composite coating,Superlattice structure,Friction-induced graphitization,Transfer film",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.022
Synthesis and characterization of GaNb11O29@C for high-performance lithium-ion battery,"The GaNb11O29 shows an open Wadsley-Roth shear structure, which is of great benefit to store ions in rechargeable batteries. In this work, we successfully synthesize GaNb11O29@C via a simple solid-state reaction method combined with carbon-coating modification. As anode for LIBs, the as-synthesized GaNb11O29@C sample exhibits wonderful electrochemical behaviors. It exhibits high reversible capacity (227.3 mA h g−1), outstanding rate capability (58.91% retention at 700 mA g−1) and excellent long cycle performance (0.036% capacity decay per cycle). The enhancement of diffusion kinetics and rate performance assigns to the increased surface reaction activity and electrical conductivity. The open and stable crystal framework structure guarantees rapid lithium-ion migration, excellent rate performance and long cycle performance. These results tell that GaNb11O29@C is promising anode material for the application in advanced LIBs.","Wang, Zhen;Zheng, Runtian;Li, Yuhang;Yu, Haoxiang;Zhang, Jundong;Zhang, Xikun;Bi, Wenchao;Shui, Miao;Shu, Jie",2020-04-01,Ceramics International,"Carbon-coating,Anode material,GaNb11O29@C,Lithium storage",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.044,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.044
Influence of SiC fiber on thermal cycling lifetime of SiC fibers /YSZ thermal barrier coatings by atmospheric plasma spraying,"The initiation and propagation of cracks under thermal stresses easily is one of the problems limiting the thermal cycling lifetime of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). In order to improve the thermal cycling lifetime, SiC fibers were introduced to yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) coating deposited on In738LC substrate by atmospheric plasma spray (APS). Phase composition, thermal cycling behaviors and fiber toughening mechanisms of coatings were systematically investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermal cycling test. Results showed that the thermal cycling lifetime and fracture toughness of SiC fibers/YSZ coatings could reach 442 ± 13 and 1.54 ± 0.19 MPa m respectively, which were 1.6 times and 1.3 times higher than that of conventional TBCs. There are two stages of fiber reinforced during thermal cycling, and the first is crack deflection and termination, the second is fiber debonding, pull-out, breakage and bridging. Meanwhile, SiC fibers could prevent the stress-activated ZrO2 martensitic transformation by reducing the stress in the lattice.","Fang, Yongchao;Cui, Xiufang;Jin, Guo;Lu, Bingwen;Wang, Fuyuan;Liu, Ming;Wen, Xin",2018-10-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Plasma spraying,Fiber reinforcement,Thermal cycling lifetime,Fracture toughness",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.040,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.040
Combined zirconia toughened alumina (ZTA) stacks obtained by electron beam physical vapour deposition,"Ion assisted electron beam physical vapour deposition (EB-PVD) technique was used for three zirconia toughened alumina (ZTA) batches containing 15, 25, 35, mole% ZrO2 and c-zirconia ceramic multilayer deposition on 617-Ni based alloy substrate.

Evaluation of the microstructure of the samples coated with c-zirconia on the top of different ZTA coats reveals three different regions. First region indicates c-ZrO2 coat, second region exhibits ZTA layers, while third is the metallic substrate. The top coat microstructure can be divided into two zones.

"Novel full-ceramic monoblock acetabular cup with a bioactive trabecular coating: design, fabrication and characterization","Over the last 25 years, the philosophy behind an optimal fixation of orthopaedic implants to hard tissues progressively evolved towards “bone-conservative” solutions in order to minimize bone resection/loss and maximize tissue-implant integration. Hence, the researchers׳ attention moved from “traditional” fixation of the prosthesis to host bone by using screws or acrylic cement to new strategies based on physico-chemical bonding and surface modification of the implant. This research work explores the feasibility of a novel bioceramic monoblock acetabular cup for hip joint prosthesis that can be fixed to the patient׳s bone by means of a bone-like trabecular coating able to promote implant osteointegration. Sponge replica method was properly adapted and optimized to produce hemispherical foam-like bioactive glass-ceramic coatings that were joined to Al2O3/ZrO2 composite cups by the interposition of a glass-ceramic interlayer. Morphological analyses by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and micro-computed tomography revealed the good quality of joining at the different interfaces. Preliminary investigation of the mechanical properties was carried out to evaluate the suitability of the device for biomedical use. In vitro bioactive behaviour was assessed by immersion studies in simulated body fluid and evaluating the apatite formation on the struts of the trabecular coating. The concepts and findings reported in the present work can have a significant impact in the field of implantable devices, suggesting a valuable alternative to currently-applied but often suboptimal techniques for bone-prosthesis fixation.","Baino, Francesco;Minguella, Joaquim;Kirk, Nicholas;Montealegre, Maria Angeles;Fiaschi, Cosima;Korkusuz, Feza;Orlygsson, Gissur;Chiara, Vitale-Brovarone",2016-05-01,Ceramics International,"D.

Slurry erosion resistance of thermally sprayed Nb2O5 and Nb2O5+WC12Co composite coatings deposited on AISI 1020 carbon steel,"Niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5) has excellent physicochemical properties regardless of the processing technology. The interest in its application in several fields has increased, especially in corrosive environments. However, when higher wear resistance is required, this material shows poorer results when compared to carbide base metals. In this work, the erosive wear resistance of thermally sprayed Nb2O5 coatings with and without carbide addition was evaluated. 500 μm thick coatings of Nb2O5 and Nb2O5 + 25% WC12Co were deposited onto AISI 1020 steel by flame spray. The coatings were characterized in the cross section by SEM/EDS techniques. Microhardness (HV0.05) and fracture toughness (KIC) measurements by the Vickers indentation toughness test (VIT) technique were performed on the cross section of the coatings. Erosive wear resistance was determined using a container tribometer with erosive mixing at a particle velocity of 9.33 m/s and 90° particle incidence angles. A nonparametric Mann-Whitney statistical analysis was performed on the results, considering a p significance level of 0.05. The addition of 25% WC12Co to the Nb2O5 increased the microhardness and fracture toughness of the coating. Nb2O5+ WC12Co composite coatings showed higher resistance to erosive wear, showing 81 ± 9 mg mass loss, 51% lower than the Nb2O5 coating (157 ± 6 mg).","Fals, Hipólito Carvajal;Lourençato, Luciano Augusto;Orozco, Mario Sánchez;Belém, Maria Julia Xavier;Lima, Carlos Roberto Camello",2020-12-01,Ceramics International,"Slurry wear erosion,Thermal spray,Nb2O5,WC12Co,Coatings",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.264,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.264
"Phase, compositional, structural, and chemical stability of La2Ce2O7 after high temperature heat treatment","High temperature stability of potential materials for thermal barrier coatings becomes increasingly important at elevated temperatures. Therefore, high temperature stability, including phase, compositional, structural, and chemical stability of lanthanum cerate (La2Ce2O7, LC) with yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) was investigated after heat treatment at 1300 °C. LC was found to possess excellent phase and compositional stability because of unique fluorite structure. In addition, the mole ration between Ce and La elements was close to 1:1 after prolonged high temperature treatment at 1300 °C. However, LC exhibited poor structural and chemical stability due to poor sintering resistance and severe reaction with YSZ. Rapid grain coarsening and pore-healing were observed. Moreover, interdiffusion reaction between LC and YSZ induced by the large difference in Gibbs free energy values led to the formation of pores with high sintering resistance. Two new materials with pyrochlore and fluorite crystal structures were also present in annealed composite samples.","Liu, X.Y.;Yi, H.;Che, J.W.;Liang, G.Y.",2019-03-31,Ceramics International,"La2Ce2O7,High temperature stability,Reaction,ZrO2-CeO2-La2O3",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.204,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.204
Substrate heating and post-annealing effect on tungsten/tungsten carbide bilayers grown by non-reactive DC magnetron sputtering,"Tungsten–tungsten carbide (W/WC) bilayers were produced by non-reactive DC magnetron sputtering at various substrate temperatures between room temperature and 300°C. The coatings were characterized in terms of morphology, structure and chemical composition using several techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman Spectroscopy, Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) and Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) in the Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) mode. Bragg peaks corresponding to the (110) diffraction plane of the W phase and (111), (200), (220) and (311) peaks corresponding to the cubic WC phase were identified. From the XRD analysis, a strong influence of the substrate temperature on the grain size and crystallographic texture was observed; nevertheless, a poor influence on the lattice parameter and microstrain was detected. Furthermore, different vibrational modes of the W3C structure and characteristic peaks corresponding to O3W3O bonds were observed. Depth profile analysis was also carried out using AES, which revealed the presence of C, W, O and Fe. Initially, carbon and tungsten were observed in the WC layers. After the films were totally etched, Fe from the substrate was detected. However, the morphology was not significantly affected by temperature. An important result was the improvement in the coatings' adherence when an interlayer of W was inserted. In this work, the bilayers' behavior during annealing was also studied. The films were observed to oxidize at approximately 600°C.","Agudelo-Morimitsu, L.C.;De La Roche, J.;Escobar, D.;Ospina, R.;Restrepo-Parra, E.",2013-09-30,Ceramics International,"XRD,Raman,AES,SEM,AFM",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.02.075,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.02.075

The effects of the copolymers coating on the structure, morphology, magnetic and electromagnetic performances of the prepared multiferroic nanocomposite surface were comprehensively investigated via XRD, FESEM, VSM and VNA analysis. Enhanced interfacial dielectric relaxation and also perfectly tuned in impedance matching characteristics were achieved by coating nanocomposite with co-polymers. Coating multiferroic nanocomposite with PEDOT/Polyaniline polymers were leading to decrease in matching thickness. Moreover, the significant improvement in microwave absorption properties were also investigated. It was noticed that the coated nanocomposite achieved maximum reflection loss of −60 dB at 11.8 GHz matching frequency with 3.9 GHz bandwidth.","Jiang, Shanshan;Wang, Entong;Akhtar, Majid Niaz",2020-12-15,Ceramics International,"Microwave absorption,La0.9Bi0.1Fe0.8Co0.2O3 /MWCNTs nanocomposite,Magnetic properties,Co-polymer",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.318,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.318
Iron boride-based thermal diffusion coatings for tribo-corrosion oil production applications,"Engineering components and tubing systems for the down-hole applications in the oil production should withstand severe friction, sliding abrasion and corrosion actions. To resolve wear and corrosion issues, the hard iron boride-based coatings on steels obtained through the thermal diffusion process can be applied on the entire working surfaces of large size and complex shape products. The behavior of these coatings obtained at Endurance Technologies Inc. has been studied in the friction–abrasion, friction–corrosion and friction–abrasion–corrosion conditions simulating oil production service conditions. Tribological studies have been conducted using the “rod-on-flat” reciprocating sliding method in the conditions simulating actual application conditions. The synergistic actions of harsh conditions results in a higher rate of materials destruction. The obtained iron boride coatings demonstrated significantly lower wear losses with no delamination and spalling than untreated steels and Ni- and Cr-based coatings. The encouraging tribo-corrosion test results for boride coatings are explained by their high hardness and chemical inertness, specific structure obtained through the thermal diffusion process with reduced micro-crack propagation and the thin “tribofilm” formed during a friction mode. Successful application of the products with the boride protective coatings is reported.","Medvedovski, Eugene;Jiang, Jiaren;Robertson, Mark",2016-02-01,Ceramics International,"C. Corrosion,C.

Hollow ZnSnO3 cubes@carbon/reduced graphene oxide ternary composite as anode of lithium ion batteries with enhanced electrochemical performance,"The ternary composite, carbon coated hollow ZnSnO3 (ZS@C) cubes encapsulated in reduced graphene oxide sheets (ZS@C/rGO), was synthesized via low-temperature coprecipitation and colloid electrostatic self-assembly. The uniform carbon-coating layer not only plays a role in buffering the volume change of ZnSnO3 cubes in the charging/discharging processes, but also forms three-dimensional network with the cooperation of graphene to maintain the structural integrity and improve the electrical conductivity. The results show that the reduced graphene oxide sheets encapsulated ZS@C microcubes with a typical core-shell structure of ~700nm in size exhibit an improved electrochemical performance compared with bare ZS@C microcubes. The ZS@C/rGO electrode delivered an initial discharge capacity of 1984mAhg−1 at a current density of 0.1Ag−1 and maintained a capacity of 1040mAhg−1 after 45 cycles. High specific capacity and superior cycle stability indicate that the ZS@C/rGO composite has a great potential for the application of lithium-ion anode material.","Jiang, Ranran;Wang, Yankun;Gao, Chengwei;Li, Ang;Liu, Yushan;Li, Dan;Zhang, Jianmin",2017-10-15,Ceramics International,"Zinc stannate,Reduced graphene oxide,Hollow,Microcubes,Lithium-ion batteries",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.031,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.031
Electrophoretic deposition and sintering of a nanostructured manganese–cobalt spinel coating for solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,"Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is one of the promising candidates for clean energy production. Due to the high operating temperature of SOFCs, a protective coating is commonly applied on the surface of interconnects to prevent oxidation. In this study, electrophoretic deposition was employed to prepare a manganese–cobalt spinel coating on ferritic stainless steel (AISISAE430) substrates. Nanostructured MnCo2O4 powder with an average crystallite size of 60nm was utilized and the sintering behavior of the coatings at different temperatures was studied. Non-isothermal and isothermal sintering behavior of the powder were examined by employing a sensitive dilatometer. Master sintering curve of the spinel powder was also established. The activation energy of sintering was determined to be 513±13kJmol−1. Finally, the oxidation behavior and electrical properties of the prepared specimens were studied.

Study of the high temperature oxidation performance of Thermal Barrier Coatings with HVOF sprayed bond coat and incorporating a PVD ceramic interlayer,The performance of an intermediate Cr3C2 ceramic layer applied by PVD between the bond coat and the ceramic top coat in a TBC system was evaluated. The thickness of the transitional layer was kept around 1–2μm. Two substrate materials and two distinct bond coats were combined in the tests. High Velocity Oxygen Fuel (HVOF) and Atmospheric Plasma Spraying (APS) were used respectively for bond coat and top coat deposition. Isothermal oxidation tests were performed at 1000°C in static air atmosphere. Thermal grown oxide (TGO) was measured and correlated to the exposition times. Results are discussed in terms of the TGO growth rate and changes in residual stresses.

Novel scaffolds based on hydroxyapatite/poly(vinyl alcohol) nanocomposite coated porous TiO2 ceramics for bone tissue engineering,"The work is focused on the preparation of novel tissue engineering scaffolds with suitable initial mechanical properties and favorable microstructure based on biodegradable polymer/inorganic nanocomposite and porous ceramic. Macroporous TiO2 scaffolds with pore sizes ranging from 100 to 500μm were obtained by the polyurethane foam replication method. Uniform, a few micrometers thin coating composed of hydroxyapatite synthesized in presence of poly(vinyl alcohol) were obtained on the porous TiO2 scaffolds through vacuum-assisted impregnation method while the original macroporosity and open pore structure of the TiO2 scaffolds were maintained. The mechanical strength as well as degradation and in vitro bioactivity of the scaffolds were characterized.

"Properties of (Cr,Al,Si)N-(DLC-Si) composite coatings deposited on a cutting ceramic substrate","The article discusses the specific features of the deposition of (Cr,Al,Si)N-(DLC-Si) composite coatings on the (Al2O3 + TiC) ceramic substrate and studies the performance properties of ceramic cutting tools with the above coatings. Three coating options were considered, including a (Cr,Al,Si)N transition layer and a DLC-Si wear-resistant layer with various options of Si content. The coating structure was investigated using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-resolution TEM. The crystalline structures of the coatings were studied using the selected-area diffraction pattern. The studies substantiated the need for the application of a (Cr,Al,Si)N transition layer between a ceramic substrate and the DLC-Si coating, and the influence of the Si content on the coating properties was also considered. The cutting properties of tools with the DLC-Si coatings of various structures were studied during the turning of AISI 52100 (HRC 56-58) hardened steel. The studies also focused on the wear pattern of uncoated tools and tools with the studied coatings. The application of the (Cr,Al,Si)N-(DLC-Si) coating changes the wear pattern and can prolong the life of a ceramic cutting tool.","Grigoriev, S.N.;Volosova, M.A.;Vereschaka, A.A.;Sitnikov, N.N.;Milovich, F.;Bublikov, J.I.;Fyodorov, S.V.;Seleznev, A.E.",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"Nanocomposite functional coating,DLC,Ceramic cutting tool,Tool wear",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.147,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.147
"Comparison of the anti-coking performance of CVD TiN, TiO2 and TiC coatings for hydrocarbon fuel pyrolysis","Previous work has shown that both TiN and TiO2 coatings can inhibit the metallic catalytic coking effectively, but both of them have their own shortage. In this work, TiC coating was prepared on the surface of SS304 tube using TiCl4-CH4-H2 by CVD method. Its morphology, elemental composition, thickness and oxidation resistance were characterized by SEM, EDX, metalloscopy and TPO tests, respectively. The results show that CVD TiC coating is gray, homogeneous, and dense without cracks or holes. The TiC coating presents a cuboid particle structure with the sizes of about 1.0µm for the cuboid crystals, and the Ti/C ratio close to 1:1, while the average thickness is about 11.62µm. TPO results show that the TiC coating begins to react with O2 and release CO2 at about 810°C. Compared with the TiN coating (The initial oxidation temperature of TiN is about 350°C), the oxidation resistance of TiC coating is improved substantially. As a conclusion, the high oxidation resistance order is TiO2 coating>TiC coating>TiN coating. Furthermore, the temperature programmed cracking of RP-3 Chinese jet fuel was employed to compare the anti-coking performance of TiN, TiO2 and TiC coatings. The results show that each of TiN, TiO2 and TiC coating has obvious anti-coking effect, and the anti-coking performance order is TiN coating=TiC coating>TiO2 coating.","Tang, Shiyun;Shi, Ning;Wang, Jianli;Tang, Anjiang",2017-03-31,Ceramics International,"Anti-coking performance,TiC coating,Oxidation resistance,Temperature programmed cracking",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.036,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.036
Effect of current density and deposition time on microstructure and corrosion resistance of Ni-W/TiN nanocomposite coating,"Ni-W/TiN nanocomposite coatings were successfully prepared via pulse electroplating from an electrolyte containing suspended TiN nanoparticles. The effects of applied current density and deposition time on microstructure, morphology, composition, hardness and electrochemical behaviors of the obtained coatings were investigated. Results showed that the current density and deposition time affect remarkably the electrochemical co-deposition process and then the structure and characteristics of the composites. It illustrated that the nanocomposites are uniform, compact and crack-free. The nanocomposites prepared at I a = 3 A dm−2 and t = 20 min had the finest structure, showing a fine and smooth surface. EDS mapping and XPS spectra illustrated that the TiN nanoparticles had been homogeneously dispersed throughout the coating. 2.34 wt% TiN nanoparticles were embedded in Ni–W (68.56 wt% Ni and 29.1 wt% W) alloy matrix at I a= 3.0 A dm−2. The inclusion of TiN nanoparticles in Ni–W could promote the nucleation and cause a distinct microstructural change. The crystallite size was in the range of 11–15 nm. The average roughness value (R a) is 65.7 nm and 73.8 nm for coating formed at 20 min and 40 min, respectively. The electrochemical measurements illustrated that I a = 3–5 A dm−2 and t = 40–60 min was the optimal operating parameters for the excellent anti-corrosion properties of Ni–W/TiN nanocomposites. The embedded TiN in Ni–W matrix could fill defects then improve its corrosion resistance. This electrodeposited Ni–W/TiN nanocomposites possess excellent hardness and superior corrosion resistance, and is expected to be applied in aggressive environment as a protective coating.","Li, Baosong;Li, Dandan;Chen, Wei;Liu, Yuying;Zhang, Jun;Wei, Yulei;Zhang, Weiwei;Jia, Wanchun",2019-03-31,Ceramics International,"Ni-W/TiN,Nanocomposite coating,Electrodeposition,Corrosion resistance,Microstructure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.184,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.184
Effect of pyrolytic carbon coating on the microstructure and fracture behavior of the Cf/ZrB2-SiC composite,"The high sintering temperature and interface interaction seriously degraded the toughening effects of continuous carbon fiber in ZrB2-SiC ceramic. The pyrolytic carbon coated carbon fiber reinforced ZrB2-SiC composite (Cf-PyC/ZrB2-SiC) with desirable properties was successfully achieved via brushing nano ZrB2-SiC slurry followed by spark plasma sintering at relatively low sintering temperature. The fabricated Cf-PyC/ZrB2-SiC composite presented a non-brittle fracture feature and a remarkable enhancement in comparison with the ZrB2-SiC composite reinforced by the as-received carbon fiber (Cf-AS/ZrB2-SiC). The fracture toughness and critical crack size were increased from 5.97 ± 0.18–7.66 ± 0.24 MPa m1/2 and from 91.6 to 164.5 µm, respectively. A high work of fracture of 1915 J/m2 for Cf-PyC/ZrB2-SiC composite was achieved, almost four times higher than that of the Cf-AS/ZrB2-SiC composite (463 J/m2). Multiple toughening mechanisms contributed to such enhancement, such as crack deflection, fiber bridging, fiber pull-out and crack branching. This work provides a feasible approach to fabricate high-performance fiber reinforced ceramic composites having a high work of fracture.","Zhang, Dongyang;Hu, Ping;Dong, Shun;Qu, Qiang;Zhang, Xinghong",2018-11-30,Ceramics International,"ZrB2,Pyrolytic carbon coating,Microstructures,Mechanical properties,Multiple toughening",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.210,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.210
Effects of alumina nanoparticles concentration on microstructure and corrosion behavior of coatings formed on titanium substrate via PEO process,"Plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) process was employed to create ceramic coatings on titanium substrate by using silicate-based electrolytes containing different concentrations of alumina nanoparticles (0, 3, 6, and 10g/lit). The effect of alumina nanoparticles concentration on the morphology, chemical and phase composition of the PEO coatings was investigated by scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive spectrometer, and X-ray diffractometer, respectively. The corrosion behavior of samples was studied by potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests. SEM, EDS, and XRD analyses illustrated that alumina nanoparticles incorporated into the coatings and reduced the density and size of the pores. Furthermore, according to the voltage-time responses, presence of alumina nanoparticles in the electrolyte increased the starting time of sparking due to hindrance effect of these particles on the barrier layer formation. It was found that the corrosion resistance rose by increasing the concentration of alumina nanoparticles. The coating which was formed in electrolyte containing 10g/l alumina nanoparticles possessed the lowest porosity (11.2%) which boosted the corrosion resistance of the substrate from 2.33×104 to 1.26×106 Ωcm2.","Sarbishei, Sahand;Faghihi Sani, Mohammad Ali;Mohammadi, Mohammad Reza",2016-05-15,Ceramics International,"Plasma electrolytic oxidation,Alumina nanoparticles suspension,Composite coating,Corrosion,Titanium",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.02.120,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.02.120
"Processing, structural characterization and performance of alumina supports used in ceramic membranes","Although there are various commercially available methods for the separation and capture of gas species such as CO2 and H2, they are energy expensive and in some cases environmentally unfriendly. The membrane separation process presents advantages such as its relative simplicity, ease of use, low energy consumption, and application in the separation of both liquid and gas mixtures. For these reasons, the membrane technology has achieved in the last years a great commercial and strategic importance. In this work we present a structural characterization of an alumina support, before and after the deposition of a titania film on its surface. The obtained asymmetric membranes are intended to be used in gas separation processes. The alumina supports and titania coatings were prepared by dry-pressing and sol–gel process, respectively. The processed samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen sorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray microtomography (μ-CT). In order to evaluate the membranes performance, single-gas permeation experiments were performed at room temperature with nitrogen, helium, and carbon dioxide. We observed that although the alumina supports obtained in this work have not been submitted to any surface finishing procedure, the obtained membranes have potential application in gas separation processes. We observed that increasing the pressure feed leads to improving their separation capacity.","Silva, Leonardo L.O.;Vasconcelos, Daniela C.L.;Nunes, Eduardo H.M.;Caldeira, Lecino;Costa, Vilma C.;Musse, Ana P.;Hatimondi, Sueli A.;Nascimento, Jaílton F.;Grava, Wilson;Vasconcelos, Wander L.",2012-04-30,Ceramics International,"Alumina,Titania,Support,Membrane,Sol–gel,X-ray microtomography",10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.10.025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.10.025
Effect of spraying parameter and injector angle on the properties of in-flight particles and alumina coatings on Al alloy with PA-HT,"Bonding strength is one of the most important properties of plasma sprayed coatings, especially ceramic coatings on complexly shaped light alloys, which is mainly determined by the properties of in-flight particles and their flattening behaviors on substrate surface. Consequently, the influence of current, voltage, primary gas flow rate and injector angle on temperature and velocity of in-flight alumina particles and morphology of splats on Al alloy with plasma arc-heat treatment (PA-HT) were investigated in detail by DPV Evolution, optical microscope and 3D non-contact surface mapping profile. The bonding strength, hardness and wear behavior of corresponding alumina coatings were measured by universal testing machine, nano-indentation test and wear test. Results showed that particle temperature and velocity increased with increase of input current and voltage, while their trends were reverse with increasing primary gas flow rate. The droplets could melt Al alloy surface and penetrate into its interior that greatly affected the morphology and corresponding shape factor (SF) of splats. Moreover, reducing injector angle caused droplets to glide on substrate surface and then to form “sole-like” splats. The morphology change of these splats obviously influenced the interfacial bonding strength, compactness, hardness and wear resistance of alumina coatings.","Hou, Guoliang;Zhao, Xiaoqin;An, Yulong;Zhou, Huidi;Chen, Jianmin",2018-02-15,Ceramics International,"Plasma spraying,Particle temperature and velocity,Injector angle,Bonding strength,Flattening behavior,Wear behavior",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.085,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.085
Microstructure and properties of in-situ composite coatings prepared by plasma spraying MoO3–Al composite powders,"MoO3–Al composite powders were used for preparing in situ composite coatings. Effects of the composition of MoO3–Al composite powder on the microstructure and properties of the as-prepared coatings were investigated. The results show that the main phases of the as-prepared coatings were γ-Al2O3 and Mo. An optimal composition (63 wt%) of MoO3 in MoO3–Al composite powder was demonstrated. The porosity of the as-prepared composite coatings decreased first and then increased with the increase of MoO3. This is attributed to the fact that the melting state of the powder during plasma spraying is closely involved in the content of MoO3. The coating prepared by composite powder with 63 wt% MoO3 had the most Al2O3 and the highest microhardness. The wear resistance of 63 wt% MoO3 composite coating was the best among four coatings with different content of MoO3, which is attributed to its high hardness and good toughness.","Wang, Yan-wei;Wang, Xing-yu;Wang, Xiao-long;Yang, Yong;Cui, Yu-hang;Ma, Yu-duo;Sun, Wen-wei",2020-08-25,Ceramics International,"Plasma spraying,MoO3–Al,Reaction synthesis,Wear resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.227,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.227

Also, the flexural strength of the bio-ceramic composite and the bonding state between the coatings and zirconia substrate have been characterized. A preliminary and limited in vitro cell test indicates that the new scaffold composite has no cytotoxicity to the fibroblasts which can attach, proliferate and grow on the coating surfaces.

Erosion of atmospheric plasma sprayed rare earth oxide coatings under air suspended corundum particles,"Atmospheric plasma sprayed (APS) zirconium oxide based coatings are used widely in aero engine components for providing thermal insulation, improving the corrosion and oxidation resistance. Despite its wide spread industrial use, little is known about the basic erosion behaviour and the mechanisms by which such coatings erode. In this paper, the erosive wear behaviours of Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) coatings; Lanthanum Zirconate (LZ) coatings and Inconel 738 base material (BM) were studied and compared under air jet erosion conditions with corundum particles as erodent material. The erosion behaviour was studied with respect to the different porosity volume percentages of the coatings and the changes in velocity of erodent, impact angle of erodent and erodent particle flux. It was found that in solid particle erosion, the wear resistances of YSZ and LZ coatings were the best at their lowest porosity volume and it decreased with the increase in the percentage volume of porosity. There was a linear increase in the wear resistance with the increase in hardness. Further, relationships among the erosion parameters with respect to erosive wear loss were derived by using the response surface methodology and the erosion mechanisms were discussed adequately.","Ramachandran, C.S.;Balasubramanian, V.;Ananthapadmanabhan, P.V.",2013-01-31,Ceramics International,"B: Porosity,C: Hardness,C: Wear resistance,E: Engine components",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.06.077,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.06.077
"Structural properties, electronic structures and optical properties of WB2 with different structures: A theoretical investigation","The structural, electronic and optical properties of six WB2 diborides with hP3, hP6, hP12, oP6, hR9 and hR18 structures were systematically investigated using the first-principles calculation based on density functional theory. The optimized atomic coordinates and lattice parameters agree well with the corresponding experimental and theoretical results. All WB2 are energetically stable, and hP6-WB2 has the best phase stability and hP3-WB2 shows the worst phase stability. The results of density of states and the charge density differences indicate that WB2 have the strong W–B and B–B covalent bonds. The hardness was obtained from the Mulliken population. The predicted values of absorption coefficient α(ω) and reflectivity R(ω) reveal that the laser with a longer wavelength is recommended during the synthesis of WB2 coatings on the substrate surface using the Nd-YAG laser. Finally, the anisotropy in optical properties for WB2 was discussed via the polycrystalline and directional static dielectric constants ε 1(0) and static refractive indexes n(0).","Liu, Dan;Duan, Yonghua;Bao, Weizong",2018-07-31,Ceramics International,"WB2,First-principles calculation,Band structure,Density of state,Optical property",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.203,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.203

As an anode material for the lithium-ion batteries, the composites exhibit a high reversible capacity (1315 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1) and long-term stability (584 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at 500 mA g−1). Such outstanding cycling stability is attributed to the small size of the SiOx particles with inner voids and the carbon layer coating can guarantee good structural integrity for long cycle stability. As a cathode material for Li–S batteries, the composite displays a high capacity and good stability (675 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.1C).

Bioactivity of strontium-monetite coatings for biomedical applications,"The bioactivity of calcium phosphate (CaP) coatings can be controlled by different CaP phase precipitation and/or addition of foreign ions to their crystal lattice. Cationic substitution of strontium (Sr) into CaP coatings has gained a great attention due to the unique potential of Sr ions on stimulating new bone formation while inhibiting bone resorption. In this study, a novel route was used for producing Sr-substituted calcium phosphate coating on metallic substrates, containing 5 mol%, 10 mol% and 15 mol% Sr concentration, by chemical deposition method. The obtained Sr-substituted calcium phosphate coatings were structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses. The presence of strontium ions into calcium phosphate phase fostered monetite precipitation, instead of brushite, and this cationic substitution was investigated by Rietveld refinement method. FEG-SEM analysis showed the bioactivity behavior by the precipitation of characteristic bone-like apatite on the 5% Sr-monetite and HA coatings after 14 days of incubation, using McCoy culture medium. The biological performance of the coated surfaces showed that hDPSCs viability was enhanced in the presence of Sr2+ ion concentration up to 10 mol% (p < 0.05) when compared to the uncoated titanium substrates and hydroxyapatite coatings. The results suggested the 5% Sr-monetite as a potential alternative for hydroxyapatite coatings, because of the improved biological responses in this study.","Navarro da Rocha, Daniel;Cruz, Leila Rosa de Oliveira;de Campos, José Brant;Santos, Jheison Lopes dos;Marçal, Rubens L.

Thermal properties and phase stability of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) coating deposited by Air Plasma Spray onto a Ni-base superalloy,"Thermal properties and microstructure characterization of Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBCs) deposited by Air Plasma Spray (APS) onto a Ni-base superalloy (Inconel 625) were studied. Two separate sets of tests were performed. The first one consisted in Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) performed over free-standing TC samples detached from TBCs. The second one included the analysis of the cross section of samples heat treated at 1100°C with holding times of 600, 1000, and 1700h. The TC porosity was analyzed for different heat treatment conditions so that inter-lamellar, intra-lamellar and globular pores, as well as cracks, were identified and quantified independently. An initial porosity reduction related to inter-lamellar and intra-lamellar pores, as well as cracks, was observed during the first 600h of heat treatment, due to sintering. However, porosity continually increased during heat treatment from 600 to 1700h driven by volumetric changes associated to phase transformations. During this period, yttrium diffused from the metastable tetragonal phase favoring the transformation to cubic phase while monoclinic phase transformed after cooling from the yttrium-depleted tetragonal phase. Energy absorption curves and the variation of heat capacity with temperature were also determined and correlated to microstructural changes.","Zambrano, D.F.;Barrios, A.;Tobón, L.E.;Serna, C.;Gómez, P.;Osorio, J.D.;Toro, A.",2018-03-31,Ceramics International,"Thermal analysis,X-Ray Diffraction,Thermal barrier coatings,Microstructural characterization",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.109,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.109
Facile synthesis of cobalt nanoparticles embedded in a rod-like porous carbon matrix with excellent electromagnetic wave absorption performance,"A rod-like porous Co/C composite was successfully fabricated by carbonizing a Co-based MOF-74 precursor. Due to significant synergy between the porous carbon framework (dielectric loss) and cobalt nanoparticles (magnetic loss) coupled with the multiple polarization loss (interfacial or dipole polarization loss) due to the porous nature of the structure, the Co/C composites showed extremely favorable microwave absorption performance. When the as-prepared cobalt-based MOF precursor was annealed at 700 °C (S700), the supreme EM wave reflection performance was −38.46 dB at 7.82 GHz with a coating thickness of 2.5 mm, whereas the broadest effective absorption bandwidth (3.3 GHz) was obtained with a coating thickness of 1.5 mm. Moreover, S600 samples exhibited an expansive absorption bandwidth range of 14.82 GHz (3.18–18 GHz) as the coating thickness was varied from 1.0 mm to 5.5 mm. The unique rod-like porous Co/C samples prepared in this study have significant potential for application in the field of the EM wave absorption.","Wang, Xiaokang;Guan, Yongkang;Zhang, Ruirong;Zhou, Panpan;Song, Zhi;Wang, Meng;Wang, Lixi;Zhang, Qitu",2020-08-20,Ceramics International,"Porous structure,Multiple loss mechanisms,Electromagnetic wave absorption,Impedance matching",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.172,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.172
Effect of plasma sprayed and laser re-melted Al2O3 coatings on hardness and wear properties of stainless steel,"Commercially available austenic stainless steel substrate was coated with commercially available, raw Al2O3 powder applied by means of plasma spraying method and then re-melted with CO2 laser beam of various parameters. Tribological and mechanical properties of the 120J/mm and 160J/mm laser re-melted coatings were compared with the tribological and mechanical properties of the “as-sprayed” coating. The influence of the laser beam of various parameters on the microstructure, phase constituents, and mechanical and tribological properties of the ceramic coating was investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy, light microscopy, computer tomography, X-ray diffraction technique and nanoindentation tests. The micro sliding wear performance of the coatings was tested using a nanoindenter. The study showed an improvement of the mechanical and tribological properties caused by the laser treatment. The best results were achieved for coating re-melted with 120J/mm laser beam.","Szkodo, Marek;Bień, Anna;Antoszkiewicz, Michał",2016-07-31,Ceramics International,"Laser treatment,Mechanical properties,Al2O3,Wear parts",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.044,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.044
Tribological behavior of SiC coating on C/C composites against SiC and WC under unlubricated sliding,"In this work, SiC coatings were prepared by chemical vapor deposition on carbon/carbon (C/C) composites. The microstructure and mechanical characteristics of the as-prepared SiC coatings were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and nano-indention. The tribological behavior of SiC coating was evaluated by a tribometer with a ball-on-disk configuration, applying SiC and WC balls as counterparts with normal contact loads of 2N, 10N and 20N under unlubricated condition. The results of tribological tests show that the friction coefficient of the SiC coating against the SiC ball (SiC/SiC coupling) is lower than that of the SiC coating against the WC ball (SiC/WC coupling) at all tested loads, and the wear volume of SiC coating for the SiC/SiC coupling is lower than that for the SiC/WC coupling by an order of magnitude. A silica film was formed between the contact surfaces for SiC/SiC coupling at 10 and 20N, which could act as lubrication layer. However, the dominant wear mechanisms of SiC/WC coupling were a mixture of abrasive and fatigue wear.","Zishan, Chen;Hejun, Li;Qiangang, Fu;Yanhui, Chu;Shaolong, Wang;Zibo, He",2013-03-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Characterization of Yb2Si2O7–Yb2SiO5 composite environmental barrier coatings resultant from in situ plasma spray processing,"Plasma spraying of multicomponent materials produces shifts in coating composition associated with differential vaporization of constituent elements within the strong thermal gradients of the process. This effect is quite noticeable in rare-earth silicates which are now widely being employed as Environmental Barrier Coatings (EBCs) for SiC based ceramic components of turbine engines. Of particular interest is the preferential volatilization of SiO2 during thermal plasma spraying Yb2Si2O7 (ytterbium disilicate) coatings which leads to the deviation from stoichiometry of the desired disilicate composition resulting in a mixed phase coating consisting of Yb2Si2O7 plus Yb2SiO5 (ytterbium monosilicate). Recent work has shown that presence of monosilicate can be beneficial as its evolution from amorphous, metastable to stable crystalline phase can lead to crack healing during high temperature exposure, however, careful control of the chemistry and architecture may be needed. In this work a 50/50 mol% Yb2Si2O7–Yb2SiO5 composite coating has been targeted through in situ decomposition during plasma spray from stoichiometric Yb2Si2O7 powder. The as sprayed amorphous coating reverts to crystalline upon thermal treatment passing through a metastable state identified by XRD and Raman spectroscopy. The transition to the final stable phases results in a mixed phase coating comprising of 46/54 mol% Yb2Si2O7–Yb2SiO5 composite that is thermo-mechanically stable with the underlying bond coated silicon coated SiC substrate.","Garcia, E.;Sotelo-Mazon, O.;Poblano-Salas, C.A.;Trapaga, G.;Sampath, S.",2020-09-30,Ceramics International,"A.

Effect of the coat layer thickness on the electrochemical activity and fine structure of TaOx/Ti electrodes,"TaOx/Ti electrodes with various coating layers were prepared through the thermal decomposition method and were characterized with electrochemical activity tests including cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Mott–Schottky analysis. CV test results revealed that the electrochemical activity of the TaOx/Ti electrode increased with the decreasing number of coating layers. A Mott–Schottky study revealed that the TaOx/Ti electrode was of p–n type, whereas the TaOx powder prepared using the same procedure was of n-type. The carrier density of the TaOx/Ti electrode also decreased with the increasing number of TaOx coat layers. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to interpret this phenomenon. XAFS results revealed that the Ta–O structure was seriously distorted close to the Ti substrate. The shift in the white-line peak position during the X-ray near-edge structure (XANES) analysis showed that oxygen vacancies and Ta(IV) were present in the TaOx/Ti electrode. Furthermore, results indicate that the oxygen vacancy concentration decreased with the increasing number of TaOx coating layers. A Tinear-edge x-ray absorption fine structure (NEAXFS) analysis of the Ti L-edge found that Ti existed on the surface of the TaOx/Ti electrode, and its concentration decreased with the increasing thickness of the TaOx coating. Density functional theory (DFT) results revealed that oxygen vacancies could be introduced into the TaOx coating and were present adjacent to the tantalum atoms around the doping Ti atoms.","Wang, Yuchao;Meng, Huimin;He, Mingtao;Yu, Hongying",2020-12-15,Ceramics International,"TaOx/Ti electrode,Different coating layers,Titanium doping,XAFS analysis,DFT calculation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.305,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.305
Ultrasound-assisted soldering of alumina using Ni-foam reinforced Sn-based composite solders,"Ultrasound-assisted dipping was performed to fabricate a Sn coating layer on the Al2O3 ceramic, then the as-coated Al2O3 ceramics were ultrasonically soldered with Ni-foam reinforced Sn and Sn-9Zn composite solders, respectively. Effects of ultrasonic soldering time on the microstructure and mechanical properties of joints were investigated. A pure Sn metallization layer which exhibited excellent metallurgic bonding with Al2O3 ceramic was fabricated by ultrasonic dipping for more than 40s. For Al2O3 joints soldered with composite solders for 4s, Ni skeletons distributed irregularly in the soldering seam and some pores existed in the base solders. A thin Ni3Sn4 intermetallic compound (IMC) layer was formed at the Sn/Ni interface while no reaction phase was found at the Sn-9Zn/Ni interface. Increasing the ultrasonic soldering time to 12s the Ni skeletons were compressed into a strip type. In the Al2O3/Ni-Sn/Al2O3 joint, the gaps among Ni skeletons were filled with Ni3Sn4 layers with some reaction cavities trapped in them. However, in the Al2O3/Ni-Sn9Zn/Al2O3 joint, the Ni skeletons gaps were mainly filled with (Ni,Zn)3Sn4 bulks with some (Ni,Zn)3Sn4 particles dispersed between them. The Al2O3/Ni-Sn9Zn/Al2O3 joint soldered for 12s exhibited the highest shear strength of 53.45MPa with the joint shear failed at the interface of filler metal layer and Al2O3 ceramic.","Xiao, Yong;Zhang, Yuanqi;Zhao, Kai;Li, Shan;Wang, Ling;Xiao, Jue;Liu, Li",2017-11-30,Ceramics International,"Alumina,Ultrasonic vibration,Ni-foam,Sn-based solder,Microstructure,Mechanical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.185,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.185
Response of 45S5 Bioglass® foams to tensile loading,"The tensile strength test of highly porous ceramic foams has been developed and first results have been obtained on bioactive glass foams. The tested material was a 45S5 Bioglass® derived foam-like scaffold intended for use in bone tissue engineering which was manufactured by Bioglass® slurry coating of polyurethane foam and subsequent sintering. The Bioglass® foam structure was investigated in two states: uncoated (as fabricated) and with a PDLLA polymer coating. The tensile testing procedure is based on fixation of the foam into aluminium pots by a suitable adhesive. Tensile test samples having cross-section of 10×10mm2 and a length of 30mm were used for the experiments. Basic fractographic analysis was applied to get relevant information about specimens' behaviour during tensile loading. In Bioglass® based scaffolds, the presence of PDLLA coating led to a significant increase of the fracture strength, which is attributed to the interaction of the polymer phase with propagating cracks, e.g. enabling a crack bridging mechanism to take place.","Řehořek, L.;Chlup, Z.;Meng, D.;Yunos, D.M.;Boccaccini, A.R.;Dlouhý, I.",2013-09-30,Ceramics International,"45S5 Bioglass®,Scaffolds,Foams,Open porosity,Tensile strength",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.03.070,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.03.070
Chemically-bonded phosphate ceramics obtained from aluminum anodizing waste for use as coatings,"Aluminum anodizing waste (AAW) was used to obtain coatings based on chemically-bonded phosphate ceramics (CBPCs) to replace primary sources of aluminum compounds. The AAW was washed to obtain aluminum hydroxide, which was used to prepare the monoaluminum phosphate (MAP) binder and calcined to obtain alumina. The coatings were applied onto ceramic substrates by spraying and cured at 350°C for 20h. After curing the coatings were characterized by SEM, XRD and the pin-on-disk abrasive wear test. The results obtained with the use of AAW in the form of MAP were equivalent to those obtained using a primary source of aluminum hydroxide. AAW calcined at 1300°C presented transition alumina phases and a surface area of around 8.25m2 g−1. The coating showed low wear resistance and microfissures. The AAW calcined at 1500°C provided wear resistance results equivalent to samples produced with commercial alumina. Only alpha alumina was identified. The surface area of around 1.54m2 g−1 was also similar to that observed for commercial alumina (1.1m2 g−1). The results indicate that AAW can be used as a raw material for the production of CBPCs, representing an alternative for adding value to an industrial waste.","Colonetti, Emerson;Hobold Kammer, Eduardo;De Noni Junior, Agenor",2014-11-30,Ceramics International,"A.

Vanadium oxide thin films on quartz and Al6061 with reduced phase transition temperature and low solar absorptance for advanced thermal control application in space,"Doped and co-doped vanadium oxide (VO) thin films were deposited on quartz substrates with varying concentrations of doping elements by sol-gel spin coating technique. The VO thin films were characterized by the X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), cross-sectional FESEM and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. The optical properties, e.g., the average solar absorptance (αs), the average solar reflectance (ρs) and the average solar transmittance (τs) of the films deposited on quartz were evaluated by using a solar spectrum reflectometer. Based on the optical characterizations, an optimized doping concentration was identified. Further, a process optimized condition was utilized to grow both doped and co-doped vanadium oxide films on metallic Al6061 substrates; which are generally used in spacecraft. The phase transitions of all as grown vanadium oxide films on Al6061 were characterized by the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique. The thin films showed reversible and repeatable phase transitions at sub-zero level of temperatures e.g., ∼ ( ̶ 23.3 °C). Thus, the VO thin films developed in the present work emerge out to be of paramount importance for the smart radiative device applications in spacecraft.","Mukherjee, Dipta;Dey, Arjun;Mukhopadhyay, Anoop Kumar",2019-12-15,Ceramics International,"Doped and co-doped vanadium oxide,Spin coated thin film,Reversible phase transition,DSC,Optical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.168,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.168
Achieving low thermal conductivity in Sr(Zr0.9Yb0.05Gd0.05)O2.95: A suitable material for high temperature applications,"Substitutional point defects alter the thermal conductivity of ABO3 type compound by influencing the phonon scattering. Coatings of Sr(Zr0.9Yb0.05Gd0.05)O2.95 are prepared with different processing parameters and then characterized using XRD, EDS, EBSD and SEM. XRD analysis confirmed that SrZrO3 is the major phase. Micro-sticks oriented in different directions are found from the SEM observations. The existence of Yb (1.79 wt %) and Gd (5.82 wt %) in the Sr(Zr0.9Yb0.05Gd0.05)O2.95 coating is confirmed from the EDS analysis.

Among the coatings prepared with different processing parameters, the Sr(Zr0.9Yb0.05Gd0.05)O2.95-2 coatings with the Ar (L/min) and H2 (L/min) flow of 35 and 7 provided minimum thermal conductivity. The lower thermal conductivity of the coating is attributed to the concentration of point defects and the optimal processing parameters.","Khan, Matiullah;Zeng, Yi",2020-12-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,Ceramic top layer,EBSD,Sr(Zr0.9Yb0.05Gd0.05)O2.95",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.040,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.040
Deposition mechanisms of columnar structured La2Ce2O7 coatings via plasma spray-PVD,"Recently, a columnar structured La2Ce2O7 (LC) coating was successfully produced via plasma spray-physical vapor deposition (PS-PVD) but in a relatively narrow processing window. In this paper, spray distances were adjusted in suitable regions of columnar structures based on our previous work attempting to precisely control coating microstructures. The columnar coatings were investigated to be regularly distributed along the axial (spraying) and radial directions of the plasma jet, and can be divided into three types including PVD-like, Closely-packed and Particle-concomitant, respectively. The PVD-like coatings deposited mainly from vapor phase distribute at relatively short spray and radial distances, while the Closely-packed ones distribute at long radial distances (periphery of the samples). In addition, the Particle-concomitant ones distribute at long spray distances. The related deposition mechanisms are discussed and a deposition model is built to provide an additional understanding of PS-PVD.","Zhao, Cong;He, Wenting;Shi, Jia;Guo, Qian;Li, Jimeng;Guo, Hongbo",2020-06-15,Ceramics International,"La2Ce2O7 (LC),Plasma spray-physical vapor deposition (PS-PVD),Columnar structure,Deposition mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.125,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.125
Potential and morphological transitions during bipolar plasma electrolytic oxidation of tantalum in silicate electrolyte,"Surges in the cell potential, due to an increased overpotential for hydrogen evolution, and transitions in ceramic oxide coating morphology during plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) of tantalum under a pulsed bipolar current regime at 1000 Hz in a silicate electrolyte are investigated using real-time imaging of gas evolution, analytical scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and supplementary potential-controlled electrochemical measurements. The coatings, which contained Ta2O5, TaO and incorporated silicon species, revealed a nodular morphology that transformed with treatment time to a “pancake” type and then a “coral reef” type. The first potential surge occurred only in the cathodic potential, coinciding with an increased spark intensity, more vigorous gas evolution, emergence of “pancake” structures and a reduction in the coating porosity. The later increases in both the anodic and cathodic potential, coincided with intensification of the sparking, the establishment of silicon-rich “coral reef” structures, and formation of a comparatively thick coating. The kinetics of coating growth differed significantly between the three morphological stages. Electrochemical measurements showed that anodic discharges increased the overpotential for hydrogen evolution in the subsequent cathodic pulse, which is proposed to be due to gas impeding the coating and at and near the coating surface increasing the resistance to ionic transport.","Cheng, Yingliang;Zhang, Qinghe;Zhu, Zhunda;Tu, Wenbin;Cheng, Yuling;Skeldon, Peter",2020-06-15,Ceramics International,"Plasma electrolytic oxidation,Tantalum,Cathodic process,Hydrogen evolution",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.120,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.120

Enhanced anti-wear property of VCN coating in seawater with the optimization of bias voltage,"Through multi-arc ion plating technology, the VCN coatings were successfully prepared under various bias voltages.

Besides, the toughness, corrosion resistance and anti-wear ability of VCN coatings were enhanced to varying degrees by changing the bias voltage. By contrast, the VCN coating at −100 V presented the smallest friction coefficient (COF) of 0.113 and wear rate of 5.25 × 10−7 mm3/Nm, implying an attractive protective effect for key friction parts in marine environment.","Ye, Yuwei;Jiang, Zilong;Zou, Yangjun;Guo, Shengda;Zeng, Xianhui;Yi, Zhou;Yu, Jiangwei;Gui, Jiabin;Liu, Tingguang;Chen, Hao",2020-04-15,Ceramics International,"VCN coating,Bias voltage,Toughness,Wear,Seawater",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.014

In order to maintain both the superior mechanical properties and oxidation resistance in severe working conditions, the nanostructured NiCrCoAlY-TiB2 coating was fabricated by the activated combustion high velocity air-fuel spraying (AC-HVAF) with the composite powders prepared by ball milling and plasma spheroidization.

LiFePO4/C nanocomposite synthesized by a novel carbothermal reduction method and its electrochemical performance,"LiFePO4/C cathode material was synthesized via a novel carbothermal reduction method, which combined the solution mixing of the raw materials with a two-step addition of carbon sources (sucrose and TWEEN 80). The sucrose was mainly used for reducing the Fe3+, and the TWEEN 80 was mainly used for carbon coating during the carbothermal reduction process, respectively. The structure, morphology, and composition of the as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscope (TEM). High resolution TEM analysis showed that a uniform carbon coating on the surfaces of the LiFePO4 particles was achieved, and the thickness of the carbon layer was about 3.5nm. As cathode material for the lithium ion battery, the as-prepared LiFePO4/C nanocomposite exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 159.4mAhg−1 at 0.1C, and excellent capacity retention of ~98% at the 50th cycle.

Mechanical properties of plasma sprayed nanostructured TiO2 coatings on mild steel,"This paper discusses the effects of plasma spray parameters on the mechanical properties of nanostructured TiO2 coatings deposited on mild steel substrates. The design of experiment method was applied to investigate the significant effects of each property and to optimize the operational spray parameters. Plasma power, powder feed rate, and stand-off distance were selected as independent variables. Agglomerated and sintered nano-TiO2 powder was deposited on A-36 commercial mild steel. The microstructural and mechanical properties of the coatings such as porosity, microhardness, surface roughness, and wear rate were evaluated. Both plasma power and powder feed rate were found to be the main factors affecting all four responses. It was also noted that the stand-off distance was a significant factor mainly in influencing the surface roughness of the coatings. All in all, the optimized properties can be achieved by applying a plasma power of 30KW (high level), a powder feed rate of 22g/min (high level), and a stand-off distance of 80mm (low level).","Forghani, S.M.;Ghazali, M.J.;Muchtar, A.;Daud, A.R.",2014-06-30,Ceramics International,"B.

Stress development in thermal barrier coatings with morphology-controlled thermally grown oxide,"Formation of thermally grown oxide (TGO) on the interface between top coat (TC) and bond coat (BC) is critical for thermal barrier coating system (TBCs) failure during long-term exposure. Because the oxidation is inevitable, alternative control of the TGO morphology may provide a new perspective in improving the anti-spalling behavior of TBCs. In this work, a TGO morphology with “root-like” oxides penetrating into the BC is studied, and effects of the “root-like” oxides on the stress development are thoroughly investigated through combining a diffusion-oxidation reaction model and a creep-plastic constitutive model. Results show that the maximum tensile stress now locates inside the BC rather than on the interface, implying that the morphology could alter propagation direction of cracks and thus enhance the interfacial delamination resistance of TBCs. Controlling of the TGO morphology offers some new insights in increasing the TBCs bond strength, and may have great potentials in the thermal-engineering industry.","Chai, Yijun;Yang, Xiongwei;Li, Yueming;Ogawa, Kazuhiro",2019-11-30,Ceramics International,"Morphology-controlled TGO,Thermal barrier coating system,Stress development",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.020,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.020
Effect of oxide growth on the stress development in double-ceramic-layer thermal barrier coatings,"A numerical study is conducted to investigate the effect of oxide growth on the stress development within the plasma sprayed double-ceramic-layer thermal barrier coatings. The roles of oxide morphology, growth rate, and oxidation duration are discussed. A two-dimensional periodical unit-cell model is developed, taking into account the different interfacial roughnesses among the coatings layers. Thermal gradient conditions are imposed during the high-temperature period to represent the non-uniform temperature distributions throughout the coatings thickness. It is found that stresses in the regions that close to the interface of the ceramic layers result from the thermal expansion mismatch and the non-uniform temperature field, in which the oxide growth reveals negligible influence on the development of the stresses. The gradually thickening thermally grown oxide (TGO) mainly contributes to the variations of stress and inelastic strain evolutions in its nearby regions. The residual stress fields in the coatings are almost unaffected by the oxide thickness after operating for a sufficiently long time. During long-term operation, the large inelastic deformation is found to be the intrinsic reason responsible for the cracking in the vicinity of TGO.","Li, Biao;Fan, Xueling;Zhou, Kun;Wang, T.J.",2017-12-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Double ceramic layer,Thermally grown oxide,Stress development",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.218,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.218

The humidity sensor was fabricated by coating NBT–BT6 nanofiber on a ceramic substrate with Ag–Pd interdigitated electrodes. At 100Hz, the impedance of the humidity sensor changed by more than five orders of magnitude with the relative humidity (RH) changing from 11% to 95%. The response time and recovery time were about 2s and 50s, respectively, and the maximum hysteresis was around 5% RH. The results indicate that NBT–BT6 nanofibers are of great potential for high-performance humidity sensor applications.","Li, Peiwen;Zheng, Xuejun;Zhang, Yong;Yuan, Mengjiao;Jiang, Bin;Deng, Shuifeng",2015-12-31,Ceramics International,"(Na0.5Bi0.5)0.94TiO3–Ba0.06TiO3 nanofibers,Electrospinning,Humidity sensor,Complex impedance plots",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.07.054,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.07.054
Microstructure of a sialon composite prepared by hot pressing and reactive sintering of β-Si3N4 coated with amorphous Al2O3,"A composite microstructure, consisting of β-sialon, O-sialon and X-sialon phases, was produced by coating β-Si3N4 particles with amorphous alumina followed by hot pressing and reactive sintering at 1923 K. The microstructure, chemistry of the phases and interphase interfaces of this ceramic were characterized by TEM and high resolution AEM. Both polyhedral and elongated β-sialon grains were observed. TEM examination showed the formation of a large number of β-sialon grains and PEELS and EDS X-ray microanalysts in AEM revealed they had varying amounts of aluminum and oxygen contents. HREM examination of several interphase interfaces and triple junctions suggests that the amount of glassy phase in the produced ceramic is substantially lower compared to those reported in the literature. This is of importance for high temperature properties. ©","Ghosh, G;Vaynman, S;Fine, M.E",1999-09-30,Ceramics International,"B. Microstructure,D.

Microstructure and ferroelectric properties of sol–gel graded PZT (40/52/60) and (60/52/40) thin films,"Graded Pb(Zr x ,Ti1−x )O3 films with Zr compositions varied across the thickness direction were deposited on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrate using a conventional spin-coating method. The up- and down-graded PZT films exhibited the perovskite polycrystalline structure. Microstructure investigations of the films showed a dense texture and successive layers of different compositions. The relative permittivities of the up- and down-graded PZT films measured at 1kHz and room temperature were 1846 and 1019, respectively. Good dielectric and ferroelectric properties as well as the low-temperature processing suggested that the compositionally graded PZT films were promising for memory device applications.","Khaenamkaew, P.;Bdikin, I.D.;Kholkin, A.L.;Muensit, S.",2008-05-31,Ceramics International,"Sol–gel method,Ferroelectric,Dielectric,PZT graded films",10.1016/j.ceramint.2007.09.082,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2007.09.082
Mg-doped TiO2 thin films deposited by low cost technique for CO gas monitoring,"This research work reports the preparation of Mg-doped TiO2 thin films by the sol–gel spin coating technique. The films deposited on silicon substrate were then used for detection of carbon monoxide (CO) gas at room temperature. The doping of magnesium was varied from 1% to 7% weight/volume. The films were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Ultra–visible spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy technique. The predominant anatase phase was observed by XRD patterns of Mg-doped TiO2 films. The indirect bandgap calculated by Tauc equation was found to be decrease with increase of Mg dopant into TiO2. The resistivity of doped TiO2 films was also observed to be decrease with increase of doping concentration of magnesium. The response for CO gas was measured by measuring the electrical resistance of the doped films in the concentration range of 120–920ppm.

"The effect of In2O3 conductive coating on the luminescence and zeta potential of ZnS:Cu, Al phosphors","Phosphors used in CRTs have been coated with In2O3 conductive layer derived from the hydrolysis of indium chloride. It was found that brightness of the phosphors rises initially with the amount of InCl3, reaches a maximum at 10wt.% InCl3 and then decreases when more InCl3 was added. With 10wt.% InCl3 coating, the brightness of ZnS:Cu, Al phosphor increases by 24% at 800V and 1μA while very little changes were observed in the luminescent emission peak and CIE color loci. The luminescence decay times increase with the increase of the conductive coating. However, they are shorter than 0.7μs for samples with the amount of coating ranging from 0 to 20wt.% InCl3 and are suitable for display applications. Conductive coating affects the surface chemistry of the phosphor particles, enhances the zeta potential of ZnS:Cu, Al in IPA solution, and, consequently, increases the electrophoretic deposition rate of the phosphors onto substrate. The zeta potential of 10wt.% InCl3 coated ZnS:Cu, Al in isopropyl alcohol solution is 32mV as compared to 1.2mV of that of the uncoated ZnS:Cu, Al. Besides, the electrophoretic deposition rate of the 10wt.% InCl3 coated ZnS:Cu, Al (0.23mg/s) is larger than that of the uncoated phosphor (0.17mg/s).","Chang, Chia-Hao;Chiou, Bi-Shiou;Chen, Kuen-Shian;Ho, Chia-Cheng;Ho, Jia-Chong",2005-12-31,Ceramics International,"Phosphors,Display,ZnS,Surface modification",10.1016/j.ceramint.2004.04.011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2004.04.011
Effect of suspension characteristics on the performance of thermal barrier coatings deposited by suspension plasma spray,"This paper investigates the influence of suspension characteristics on microstructure and performance of suspensions plasma sprayed (SPS) thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). Five suspensions were produced using various suspension characteristics, namely, type of solvent and solid load content, and the resultant suspensions were utilized to deposit five different TBCs under identical processing conditions. The produced TBCs were evaluated for their performance i.e. thermal conductivity, thermal cyclic fatigue (TCF) and thermal shock (TS) lifetime. This experimental study revealed that the differences in the microstructure of SPS TBCs produced using varied suspensions resulted in a wide-ranging overall TBC performance. All TBCs exhibited thermal conductivity lower than 1 W/(m. K) except water-ethanol mixed suspension produced TBC. The TS lifetime was also affected to a large extent where 10 wt % solid loaded ethanol and 25 wt % solid loaded water suspensions produced TBCs exhibited the highest and the lowest lifetime, respectively. On the contrary, TCF lifetime was not as significantly affected as thermal conductivity and TS lifetime, and all ethanol suspensions showed marginally better TCF lifetime than water and ethanol-water mixed suspensions deposited TBCs.","Ganvir, Ashish;Gupta, Mohit;Kumar, Nitish;Markocsan, Nicolaie",2020-08-15,Ceramics International,"Suspension plasma spraying,Thermal barrier coatings,Microstructure,Thermal conductivity,Thermal cyclic fatigue (TCF),Thermal shock testing",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.131,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.131
Vitroceramic coatings deposited by laser ablation on Ti-Zr substrates for implantable medical applications with improved biocompatibility,"The influence of vitroceramic coatings deposited onto Ti-Zr alloy plates on the biological properties of the final biomaterials was investigated. In this regard, two vitroceramic masses, different from compositional point of view, were synthesized by a sol-gel route, being subsequently converted into ceramic targets, suitable for ablation experiments. The film depositions were conducted in oxidative atmosphere, on substrates heated at 300 or 400°C. The coated samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy coupled with selected area diffraction and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, contact angle measurements and in vitro biological analyses (MTT cell proliferation assay, GSH oxidative stress assay, optical and fluorescence microscopy).

Preparation of alumina/polystyrene core-shell composite powder via phase inversion process for indirect selective laser sintering applications,"Indirect selective laser sintering (SLS) is one of the promising additive manufacturing (AM) methods that can process conventionally difficult or even impossible materials such as ceramics. In this work, an innovative phase inversion technique is used to fabricate spherical alumina particles coated with a thin layer of polystyrene (PS). Then, indirect SLS is used to fabricate green parts from the 6wt% PS coated alumina particles via a Nd:YAG laser. The assessed SLS process parameters were the scan speed, laser power, scan spacing, pulse frequency, and pulse width. The characterization of the AL2O3/PS core-shell composite particles was described using techniques including SEM (for morphology), FT-IR (for chemical bonding at the interfaces), TGA (for mass loss), and DSC (for glass transition temperature, Tg). 3D green parts were then fabricated using proper process parameters as a proof of the feasibility of using SLS technique for AL2O3/PS core-shell composite powder. The results showed that using a Nd:YAG laser with less absorption by alumina and PS provides greater penetration through a powder bed. In addition, the possibility of sound connections among particles in every direction was observed due to the uniformity of the coating process in spite of a minimal amount of binder. In addition, green part density measurements show high values compared to previously reported results.","Nazemosadat, Sayed Mahmoud;Foroozmehr, Ehsan;Badrossamay, Mohsen",2018-01-31,Ceramics International,"Indirect selective laser sintering,Spherical alumina powder,Core-shell composite powder,Phase inversion process,Thermoplastic",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.218,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.218
"Formation of sol–gel derived (Cu,Mn,Co)3O4 spinel and its electrical properties","An (Mn,Co)3O4 spinel layer effectively suppresses Cr outward diffusion, but the occurrence of spallation between coating and metal interfaces and the increasing oxidation rate over time significantly deteriorate cell performance. A transition metal cation, particularly Cu, is added into the (Mn,Co)3O4 to improve the long-term stability of the interconnect materials for low-to-intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). In this work, fine-crystalline (Cu,Mn,Co)3O4 spinel powders with an average crystallite size of 21nm were successfully synthesized via the citric acid–nitrate method. The potential for use as a coating material for low-to-intermediate-temperature SOFC interconnects was explored. According to the TG curves, IR spectra, and XRD patterns, 800°C is recommended as the minimum calcination temperature for (Cu,Mn,Co)3O4 spinel materials. Compared with (Mn,Co)3O4 spinel materials, the addition of Cu does not induce significant changes in the crystal structure but markedly improves the electrical conductivity (116 Scm−1) and the activation energy (0.394eV) of the (Cu,Mn,Co)3O4 spinel. Overall, the sol–gel derived (Cu,Mn,Co)3O4 spinel can be used as a coating material for low-to-intermediate-temperature SOFC interconnects and is superior to (Mn,Co)3O4 spinel because high electrical conductivity is preferred to minimize ohmic losses between the electrodes of adjacent cells.","Mah, Joelle C.W.;Muchtar, Andanastuti;Somalu, Mahendra R.;Ghazali, Mariyam J.;Raharjo, Jarot",2017-07-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Ultrasonic assisted pulse electrodeposited Ni-doped TiN coatings,"Ni-doped TiN coatings were deposited on 45 steel surfaces by ultrasound assisted pulse electrodeposition (UAPE) from reformative Watt nickel-based electrolytes. The effects of ultrasonic intensities on microstructure, chemical composition, nanomechanical and corrosion properties of the obtained coatings were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), nanoindenter, and electrochemistry. Ni-doped TiN coatings deposited at 20 W/cm2 showed fine and compact morphologies, with large amounts of TiN particles evenly embedded in the coatings. The average atomic percents of Ti and N elements in the coatings were estimated to approximately 17.3 at% and 24.8 at%, respectively. In addition, the Ni-doped TiN coating produced at 20 W/cm2 revealed fine, uniform, and exiguous structures in the micro areas. The average diameters of TiN nanoparticles and Ni grains were estimated to around 32.3 nm and 71.8 nm, respectively. The maximum Young's modulus and microhardness values of Ni-doped TiN coatings produced at 20 W/cm2 were measured as 167.8 and 34.3 GPa, respectively.

Structural and electrochemical characterization of NH4F-pretreated lithium-rich layered Li[Li0.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54]O2 cathodes for lithium-ion batteries,"Even though Li-rich layered oxide is considered to be a promising cathode material for Li-ion batteries because of the high discharge capacity, it still suffers from many fundamental challenges such as low initial coulombic efficiency, the voltage fading upon cycling and poor rate performance. In this work, lithium-rich layered Li[Li0.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54]O2 cathode materials are pretreated by NH4F through a facile solid state method to overcome these problems. After pretreating, the spinel phase LiM2O4 coating layer is formed accompanying with the formation of oxygen vacancies caused by NH3 decomposed from NH4F. Compared with the pristine material, materials pretreated by appropriate amount of NH4F present significantly improved electrochemical performances such as high initial coulombic efficiency and improved stability in successive electrochemical cycling, excellent rate capability and suppressed voltage decay. The pretreated material delivers the highest initial coulombic efficiency of 102.2% (NF10) compared to 74.5% of NF0 and the highest voltage retention of 90.6% compared to 86.2% of NF0. The NF0 delivers the best comprehensive performance, with higher initial coulombic efficiency and voltage retention, improved rate performance and capacity stability.","Hu, Xia;Guo, Huajun;Wang, Jiexi;Wang, Zhixing;Li, Xinhai;Hu, Qiyang;Peng, Wenjie",2018-08-15,Ceramics International,"Mn-based Li-rich layered oxide,NH4F-pretreated,Spinel phase,High initial coulombic efficiency",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.046,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.046
Colloidal processing of aluminum oxide powder for membrane applications,"The properties of dip-coating slips were varied by adjusting pH, by using nonionic or ionic additive polymers and by using different electrolytes and concentrations. Electrostatic stabilization of the slip with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) addition led to the smallest particle size resulting in the highest density and the lowest permeability of the dip coated layer. Only small amounts of nonionic PVA adsorbed on the particles, which decreased the zeta potential slightly by charge shielding. The measured particle size decreased when the PVA concentration increased. The PVA addition did not affect the isoelectric point (i.e.p.) of the alumina particles. Strongly adsorbed sodium poly(metacrylic acid) (Na-PMAA) changed the pHiep from ∼9 to ∼4. The smallest particle size was measured at pH values 7–9. The zeta potential of particles with Na-PMAA addition decreased when the ionic strength was increased. Low zeta potential values resulted in flocculation of the slip and larger flock size. The flocculated slips led to fast growth, high porosity and high permeability of the layer.","Mikkola, Pasi;Levänen, Erkki;Rosenholm, Jarl B.;Mäntylä, Tapio",2003-12-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Preparation of binary washcoat deposited on cordierite substrate for catalytic applications,"The deposition of binary M–ZrO2 (M=Al2O3, SiO2 or TiO2) as secondary support on cordierite substrate by dip-coating was investigated and the as-prepared M–ZrO2/cordierite was characterized by means of XRD and SEM techniques. After two successive dip-coating processes, the highest washcoat loading of 25.1% was achieved in Al2O3–ZrO2/cordierite, followed by 18.7% in TiO2–ZrO2/cordierite and then 17.4% in SiO2–ZrO2/cordierite.

Synthesis and characterization of CuO-hybrid silica nanocomposite coatings on SS 304,"Pure and CuO-dispersed hybrid silica nanocomposite coatings were generated using sols synthesized from acid catalyzed hydrolysis and condensation of n-propyl trimethoxysilane and tetraethoxysilane in combination with copper nitrate. Coatings were initially deposited on soda lime glass substrates by dip coating followed by heat treatment at 150, 250 and 350°C for 2h in air and characterized. Coatings were subsequently deposited by dip coating on stainless steel 304 substrates. An optimized heat treatment temperature of 250°C was chosen based on the contact angles of coatings on soda lime glass substrates and results of thermogravimetric/differential thermal analysis on the dried gels obtained from the sol synthesized from the combination of n-propyl trimethoxysilane and tetraethoxysilane. Gels heat-treated at 250°C were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy for crystallinity. Characterization of the coatings was carried out with respect to thickness, water contact angle and adhesion. Corrosion testing of coatings on SS 304 was studied by potentiodynamic polarization measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy after 1h and 24h exposure to 3.5% NaCl. The corrosion resistances of CuO-dispersed hybrid silica coatings after 1h and 24h exposure to 3.5% NaCl solution were higher than that of pure hybrid silica coatings, both of which had thicknesses ranging from 140nm–200nm.","Subasri, R.;Malathi, R.;Jyothirmayi, A.;Hebalkar, N.Y.",2012-09-30,Ceramics International,"A.

Comparative investigation of antibacterial yet biocompatible Ag-doped multicomponent coatings obtained by pulsed electrospark deposition and its combination with ion implantation,"The aim of this work is to obtain antibacterial yet biocompatible coatings using pulsed electrospark deposition (PED). For this purpose new composite electrodes were fabricated from reaction mixtures Ti–C–20%Fe-10%Ca3(PO4)2–3.4%Mg–X%Ag with different amount of antibacterial component (X = 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 at% of Ag) using self-propagating high-temperature synthesis method. The electrodes consisted of TiC grains surrounded by TiFe2 and TiFeP intermetallic matrix, CaO and MgO inclusions, and Ag-based phase. The influence of Ag content on the electrode mass transfer kinetics was studied by comparing the total substrate weight gain and electrode mass loss during PED. The structure, elemental composition, and surface roughness of coatings were studied by means of X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and optical profilometry. The coatings were characterized in terms of Ag+ ion release, mechanical and electrochemical properties, as well as biocompatibility. The antibacterial characteristics of Ag-doped PED coatings were compared with those obtained by PED using Ag-free electrode and then implanted with Ag+ ions. The results indicated that an increase in the Ag content in electrode leads to a decrease in electrode erosion and substrate weight gain, but the efficiency of the PED process increases. Doping with a small amount of Ag (≤ 1at%) resulted in 100% antibacterial effect against both gram-positive S. aureus and gram-negative E. сoli bacteria. In addition, the dynamics of МС3Т3-Е1 cell proliferation on the surface of PED coatings with 0.6–0.7at% of Ag was similar to that in control samples, hereby indicating their biocompatibility.

Ultra-high-temperature ceramic TaB2-SiC-Si coating by impregnation and in-situ reaction method to prevent graphite materials from oxidation and ablation,"A monolayer TaB2-SiC-Si protective coating was fabricated by impregnation and in-situ reaction method on the surface of graphite to prevent graphite materials from oxidation and ablation, and the microstructure, oxidative and ablative protection properties of the coating were investigated. Experimental results revealed that the coating could protect graphite from oxidation at 1020 °C and 1550 °C for more than 321 h and 168 h, respectively, and from ablation for 120 s with a heat flux of 2.38 MW/m2. The good oxidative protection performance was ascribed to the low oxygen diffusivity of the coating and oxide film formed on the coating surface, which effectively inhibited oxygen diffusion to the graphite substrate. Under oxyacetylene flame, a Ta2O5 layer was gradually formed on the coating surface and acted as a protective layer, which weakened the erosion of flame to the inner coating. The increase of ablative time promoted the fierce evaporation of gaseous Si and oxide phases, such as B2O3(g), SiO2(g), CO(g) and CO2(g), which resulted in the damage to the TaB2-SiC-Si coating, leading to the reduction of anti-ablation property of the coating.","Jiang, Yan;Liu, Tianyu;Ru, Hongqiang;Wang, Wei;Zhang, Cuiping;Yue, Xinyan",2019-04-01,Ceramics International,"Graphite,TaB2-SiC-Si coating,In-situ reaction,Oxidation protection,Ablation protection,Ta2O5 layer",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.148,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.148
Tribological performance of SiC coating for carbon/carbon composites at elevated temperatures,"SiC coating was deposited on carbon/carbon (C/C) composites by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The effects of elevated temperatures on tribological performance of SiC coating were investigated. The related microstructure and wear mechanism were analyzed. The results show that the as-deposited SiC coating consists of uniformity of β-SiC phase. The mild abrasive and slight adhesive wear were the main wear mechanisms at room temperature, and the SiC coating presented the maximum friction coefficient and the minimum wear rate. Slight oxidation of debris was occurred when the temperature rose to 300 °C. As the temperature was above 600 °C, dense oxide film formed on the worn surface. The silica tribo-film replaced the mechanical fracture and dominated the frication process. However, the aggravation of oxidation at elevated temperatures was responsible for the decrease of friction coefficient and the deterioration of wear rate. The SiC coating presented the minimum friction coefficient and the maximum wear rate when the temperature was 800 °C.","Chen, Zishan;Chen, Yu;Dong, Dachao;Yang, Qing;Hu, Miao",2018-07-31,Ceramics International,"Carbon/carbon composites,SiC coating,CVD,Tribological performance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.164,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.164
Slurry spray coating of carbon steel for use in oxidizing and humid environments,"Barrier coatings can be used to prevent corrosion of steel in high-temperature applications with oxidizing and humid environments. This study describes the development of a high-performance environmental barrier coating for steel using a slurry spraying process. In this process, a solution or suspension is deposited onto a substrate using air spraying. Parameters such as the pre-treatment of the steel substrates, filler systems, filler volume, and coating thickness were varied to optimize the coatings. The resulting coatings were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy with X-ray micro analysis, and X-ray diffraction to clarify the possible protective and bonding mechanisms. Finally, oxidation, thermal shock resistance, and humidity resistance tests were performed to evaluate the performance of the developed coating under harsh environments simulating real applications.

Hot corrosion phenomena of Nb-Ti-Si based alloy and its silicide coating induced by different corrosive environments at 900°C,"This study aims to elucidate the hot corrosion behavior of Nb-Ti-Si based alloy and its silicide coating in different molten salts at 900 °C. The results show that both K2SO4 and Na2SO4 had detrimental effect on the corrosion performance of the alloy, but almost no effect on the coating.

Effect of iron content on the wear behavior and adhesion strength of TiC–Fe nanocomposite coatings on low carbon steel produced by air plasma spray,"In this study, the effect of Fe content on the abrasion behavior of TiC–Fe nanocomposite coatings applied on the CK45 steel substrate by air plasma spray method was investigated. For this purpose, milled TiC powder was prepared at 1, 2, 3 and 4 h milled TiC powder for 4 h was selected as the suitable sample. In the next step, a suitable sample mixture with different iron powder concentrations of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25% was prepared by mechanical milling. The granulated mixture was applied to the substrate using air plasma spray technique. Microstructural and phase analyzes were performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). According to the results of Williamson-Hall calculations, the TiC crystallites' size decreased by 49 nm–29 nm, and network strain reached 0.16% by increasing milling time from 1 h to 4 h. Studies have shown that the coatings contain titanium carbide, iron oxide, and titanium oxide, with the number of phases formed depending on the amount of iron in the chemical composition. Investigation of the tribological properties of the coating layer showed that with increased iron content in the coating, the wear resistance of the samples is reduced. Hardness tests on coatings indicate that adding iron to nanocomposite from 5 to 25% reduces hardness from 1025 to 699 Hv. It can be argued that a slight increase in the adhesion strength of the coating to the substrate is due to increased wettability because of the formation of molten iron in the coating.","Ghahabi, E.;Shajari, Y.;Razavi, M.;Mobasherpour, I.;Tayebi fard, S.A.",2020-02-15,Ceramics International,"Air plasma spray,TiC–Fe nanocomposite,Wear resistance,Hardness,Adhesion strength",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.255,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.255
"Phase formation, growth kinetics and optical properties of 0.5ZnO-0.5CdO thin films synthesized by sol-gel spin coating processes","The phase formation, growth kinetics and optical properties of 0.5ZnO-0.5CdO thin films have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UV–vis spectrophotometry. The XRD results show that all 0.5ZnO-0.5CdO thin films are composed of CdO as the major phase and ZnO as the secondary phase. Moreover, after annealing of the 0.5ZnO-0.5CdO thin films at 723K for 45min and 773K for 30min, the minor phase of CdSiO3 also appeared. The average activation energy of CdO grain growth in 0.5ZnO-0.5CdO thin films by the isothermal method is 10.51±1.17kJ/mol. The average optical transparency was nearly 80% for the wavelength range from 500nm to 900nm. The grain size of CdO on the band gap energy for 0.5ZnO-0.5CdO thin films after annealing has a critical value, namely 15.9nm. When the grain size of CdO is smaller than 15.9nm, the band gap energy decreases, showing a redshift effect. Conversely, the band gap energy increases when the grain size of CdO is greater than 15.9nm, showing a blueshift effect.","Huang, Bo;Chu, Hsueh-Liang;Wang, Moo-Chin;Liu, Chao;Hwang, Weng-Sing;Zhao, Xiujian",2016-11-15,Ceramics International,"0.5ZnO-0.5CdO thin films,Grain growth,Activation energy,Optical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.08.118,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.08.118
Tailoring UV emission from a regular array of ZnO nanotubes by the geometrical parameters of the array and Al2O3 coating,"Self-aligned and equal-spaced zinc oxide (ZnO) nanotube arrays were fabricated with anodic aluminum oxide (AAO)-assisted growth and the ALD technique. The near band-edge (NBE) emission was strongly affected by the nanotube's geometrical parameters, such as a packing density and thickness of the nanotube walls. The NBE emission was further enhanced with Al2O3 coating. The effect was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ascribed to the surface defect passivation and a ZnAl2O4 spinel formation. The NBE emission enhancement was greater in ZnO nanotubes with thicker walls. A smaller UV enhancement factor was explained by less uniform and integral Al2O3 coverage of the ZnO nanotubes with thinner walls; this, possibly induced a variation of the Al2O3 refractive index along the nanotubes. As a result, the optical conditions at the ZnO/Al2O3/air interfaces was changed and the light extraction efficiency was reduced in the latter samples.","Norek, Małgorzata;Zaleszczyk, Wojciech;Łuka, Grzegorz;Budner, Bogusław;Zasada, Dariusz",2017-05-31,Ceramics International,"ZnO nanotubes,Anodic alumina,Surface passivation,Al2O3,Luminescence properties,Atomic layer deposition",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.01.108,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.01.108
Development of T-ZnOw@Al2O3-incorporated low-temperature curing aluminium phosphate coating on Ti–6Al–4V alloy,"In this study, a low-temperature curing aluminium phosphate coating was developed on a Ti–6Al–4V alloy by prolonged curing. The coating was composed of a phosphate binder, a T-ZnOw@Al2O3 core-shell curing agent, and an Al filler. The phosphate binder was produced by the reaction between phosphoric acid and aluminium hydroxide (P/Al = 3:1.4) and was mainly composed of Al(H2PO4)3. The T-ZnOw@Al2O3 curing agent was produced by sol-gel routes and its core-shell microstructure was verified by transmission electron microscopy. The curing mechanism of the coating in the presence of T-ZnOw@Al2O3 was investigated by obtaining its thermogravimetric differential thermal analysis curves and measuring its weight loss. The results showed that zinc oxide was released during curing. Complete curing was achieved at a relatively low temperature of 70 °C after prolonged curing for 120 min (P:Zn = 10:1). This rendered the phosphate coating suitable for practical applications. Though the peculiar tetrapod-like shape of T-ZnOw disappeared after being surrounded by Al2O3, the refining of the T-ZnOw@Al2O3 core-shell particles resulted in a decrease in the curing time and an increase in the hardness of the coating (higher than that of the ZnO@Al2O3 curing agent). The Al filler improved the surface roughness and oxidation resistance of the coating at 800 °C. A crack-free aluminium phosphate coating was achieved at the P:Zn:Al mass ratio of 10:1:0.05.","Liu, Fujiao;Yang, Mei;Han, Bing;Long, Jianping",2019-10-15,Ceramics International,"Aluminium phosphate coating,T-ZnOw@Al2O3,Curing,Titanium alloys,Oxidation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.056,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.056
Manufacturing of zinc oxide structures by thermal oxidation processes as scalable methods towards inexpensive electric generators,"Micro and nanostructured zinc oxide coatings were prepared from anticorrosive or cold galvanized spray paint with 93% of metallic zinc, which has been applied over glass and steel substrates as a thin film. Then, the substrate-films were processed with different methods including direct flame and a regular furnace open to air, for producing the piezoelectric materials via oxidation at high temperature. Different characterization was conducted in this research, not only materials but also the piezo-electric response. The materials characterization included scanning electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction techniques. The piezoelectric response of the fabricated materials was tested in an experimental cantilever setup with a voltage amplification circuit, which data was recorded through an oscilloscope. Results of microscopies confirmed the generation of ZnO nanowires and other micro and nano materials features for some of the samples in which the furnace was used.

"Deposition, nanostructure and phase composition of suspension plasma-sprayed hydroxyapatite coatings","Nanostructured hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings were successfully deposited on stainless steel substrates by suspension plasma spray (SPS) method. The suspension was prepared by a wet chemical method using Ca(NO3)2 and (NH4)2HPO4 as source materials. The TEM morphologies show that these HA particles are needle-like nanowires. The effect of hydrogen flow rate of plasma forming gas on the coating properties has been intensively studied. FE-SEM images confirm that coatings are nanostructured. X-ray diffraction pattern shows that as-sprayed coatings are HA phases and the crystal size is estimated to be less than twenty nanometers when low hydrogen flow rate is used. When high hydrogen flow rate is utilized, secondary phases appear in the as-sprayed HA coatings and the crystal size increases to dozens of nanometers. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and MicroRaman spectroscopy indicate the significant presence of OH− and CO 3 2 - ions in the coatings.","Xu, Haifeng;Geng, Xin;Liu, Guanxiong;Xiao, Jinkun;Li, Dayu;Zhang, Yanjun;Zhu, Peizhi;Zhang, Chao",2016-05-15,Ceramics International,"Suspension plasma spray,Hydroxyapatite,Coating,Nanostructure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.02.102,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.02.102
Crystallization kinetics of plasma sprayed basalt coatings,"Crystallization kinetics concerning the conversion of a glass coating layer made from natural basalt volcanic rock to glass-ceramic have been investigated.

Glass coatings were heat treated at 800, 900 and 1000°C for 1–4h in order to obtain glass-ceramic coating layer. DSC and XRD analysis revealed the crystallization of augite [(CaFeMg)SiO3]. Heat treatment is effective for the amorphous phase to convert into crystalline in atmospheric plasma sprayed basalt coating depending on heat treatment time and temperature. Optical microscopy was used for metallographic examinations. The kinetics of the augite was studied by applying DSC measurements carried out different heating rates and the activation energies of crystallization and viscous flow were measured as 324 and 364kJmol−1, respectively. Avrami exponents for crystallization were 1.85–2.74 which indicates that internal crystallization dominates the overall crystallization.","Bayrak, Gunhan;Yilmaz, Senol",2006-12-31,Ceramics International,"D.

A facile and cost-effective approach for the fabrication Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 thick films on flexible substrate for energy storage capacitor applications,"The current research reports a facile and cost-effective technique for the deposition of functional ceramics Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 thick films on flexible, low cost, electrically integrateable Ni substrate by using electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique. EPD is a well-known, eco-friendly process for depositing coatings on a conductive substrate from a colloidal suspension. A reliable approach was adopted for stable colloidal suspension of BNT particles during conventional solid-state synthesis process by using high energy ball milling in acetone medium without the complications of surfactants and expensive platinum substrate. BNT films with thickness ranging from ~55 to 165 μm were successfully obtained by exploring EPD parameters i.e. voltage from 100 to 125 V and coating time from 30 to 240 s. Thick coatings with comparatively better adhesiveness were deposited at 100 and 125 V with coating time up to 90 s. Thick films were densified by sintering at 1150 °C for 30 min. Phase analysis were conducted by using X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. XRD analysis revealed the formation of single (111) peak indicating the pure perovskite structure of BNT thick film. Scanning electron microscope studies indicated that dense and uniform microstructure was obtained by EPD coating with the film thickness of ~93 μm.

"Effects of gas pressure on microstructure and performance of (Ti, Al, Zr)N coatings produced by physical vapor deposition","In this study, a novel quaternary (Ti, Al, Zr)N coating was successfully fabricated via multi-arc ion plating technique on the Si3N4 ceramic substrate. A series of (Ti, Al, Zr)N coatings were produced on the silicon nitride (Si3N4) cutting tools by multi-arc ion plating technique using a combination of AlTi, pure Ti, and pure Zr targets. The effects of gas pressure on microstructure, deposition rate, coating thickness, phase constitution, mechanical properties, cutting performance, and wear mechanism of (Ti, Al, Zr)N coatings were systematically investigated by using four gas pressure values: 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0Pa during the coating preparation process. It was observed from the flank worn surface that the main wear mechanism of the (Ti, Al, Zr)N coated Si3N4 cutting tools produced at different gas pressures was adhesion wear. At 1.5 and 3.0Pa, coating spalling occurred. When the gas pressure was 2.5Pa, the wear transition zone at the flank surface was obvious, which was confirmed to be positive toward the cutting performance of the cutting tools.","Liu, Wei;Li, Anqiong;Wu, Haidong;Long, Ying;Huang, Jiawei;Deng, Xin;Wang, Chengyong;Wang, Qimin;Wu, Shanghua",2016-11-15,Ceramics International,"C.

Synthesis and characterization of Si-substituted hydroxyapatite bioactive coating for SiC-coated carbon/carbon composites,"A silicon-substituted hydroxyapatite (Si-HA) coating for SiC-coated carbon/carbon composites has been prepared by pack cementation and electrochemical deposition. The morphology, microstructure and in-vitro bioactivity of the Si-HA/SiC double-layer coatings were investigated. Results showed that the SiC inner-layer exhibited high crystallinity. The Si-HA outer-layer had a smaller crystal size than pure hydroxyapatite (HA). Simulated body fluid (SBF) immersion tests showed that the Si-HA coating was uniformly covered by a layer of apatite after 7 days of immersion, while the apatite layer formed on the HA coating was inhomogeneous. This work demonstrates that the Si-HA coating may have better bioactivity than a HA coating and shows promise for the potential application as bioactive coating.","Kezhi, Li;Qian, Guo;Leilei, Zhang;Yulei, Zhang;Shoujie, Liu;Kebing, Guo;Shaoxian, Li",2017-01-31,Ceramics International,"Silicon-substituted hydroxyapatite,Electrodeposition,Coating,Carbon/carbon composites",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.102,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.102
Calcium–magnesium aluminosilicate (CMAS) interactions with ytterbium silicate environmental barrier coating material at elevated temperatures,"Thermochemical interactions between a calcium-magnesium aluminosilicate (CMAS) glass and ytterbium disilicate (Yb2Si2O7), a candidate environmental barrier coating (EBC) material, have been investigated. Pellets of Yb2Si2O7 and CMAS glass powder were heat treated at 1200, 1300, 1400 and 1500 °C for 1, 10 and 50 h in air. Powder X-ray diffraction was employed to identify the resulting phases. In a second series of experiments, Yb2Si2O7 substrates were prepared by hot pressing, and cylindrical wells were drilled into the material surface. CMAS glass powder was added to the wells to achieve a loading of ~35 mg/cm2 and subsequently heat treated at 1200, 1300, 1400 and 1500 °C for durations of 1, 10 and 50 h in air. Sample cross-sections were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, electron microprobe analysis and transmission electron microscopy to evaluate the resulting microstructure, phases and compositions at the CMAS/Yb2Si2O7 interface. Dissolution of ytterbium silicate into molten CMAS followed by precipitation of Yb2Si2O7 coupled with CMAS grain boundary penetration at elevated temperatures were the dominant mechanisms by which CMAS effectively infiltrated and altered the Yb2Si2O7 substrate microstructure.","Wiesner, Valerie L.;Scales, David;Johnson, Nathan S.;Harder, Bryan J.;Garg, Anita;Bansal, Narottam P.",2020-07-31,Ceramics International,"CMAS,Ytterbium disilicate,Environmental barrier coating,Glass",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.249,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.249
The phase formation process of Bi0.5(Na0.8K0.2)0.5TiO3 thin films prepared using the sol-gel method,"Lead-free Bi0.5(Na0.8K0.2)0.5TiO3 (abbreviated as BNKT) thin films were grown on Pt(111)/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates using a sol-gel/spin coating technique and were then annealed at different temperatures (350°C, 550°C, 750°C and 850°C). Analysis of the XRD patterns and FT-IR spectra were used to determine the main reactions and the phase formation process of BNKT thin films during the sol-gel process. The results show that the dielectric constant of the thin films attains a maximum at a set temperature and then decreases at higher annealing temperatures, which can be attributed to phase formation and transformation. Moreover, the morphologies of the BNKT thin films improve with the increase in grain size and the formation of distinct grain boundaries. Furthermore, through increasing the pH of the precursor solutions, the size of the sol-gel colloidal particles increases slightly and the grains formed from the corresponding solutions tend to be small and uniform.","Chen, Pan;Wu, Shuanghao;Li, Peng;Zhai, Jiwei;Shen, Bo",2018-04-15,Ceramics International,"Sol-gel,pH values,Phase formation process,BNKT thin films",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.034,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.034
The effect of temperature on the growth and properties of chemical vapor deposited ZrC films on SiC-coated graphite substrates,"SiC and ZrC are critical and essential materials in TRISO coated fuel particles since they act as protective layers against the diffusion of metallic and gaseous fission products and provide mechanical strength for the fuel particles. However, SiC and ZrC have critical disadvantages in that SiC loses its chemical integrity by thermal dissociation at high temperature and the mechanical properties of ZrC are weaker than those of SiC. In order to address these problems, we made new combinations of ZrC coating layers and deposited them on SiC using a chemical vapor deposition process. We varied the growth temperature to optimize the growth conditions and analyzed the changes of the microstructure, chemical composition, and mechanical properties of the ZrC films. The deposition temperature was varied from 1200 to 1500°C and ZrC changed from a whisker structure to a film at a temperature of 1400°C. The preferred orientation was changed from the (111) plane to (220) and the chemical composition became stoichiometric. Also, the hardness and elastic modulus of ZrC increased when it was deposited at a higher temperature.","Kim, Jun Gyu;Park, Si Jung;Park, Ji Yeon;Choi, Doo Jin",2015-01-31,Ceramics International,"B.

Structural and electrochemical characteristics of Al2O3-modified LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries,"The high-voltage spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) is a potential cathode material for lithium-ion batteries with outstanding energy density and power density. Here, we document a facile approach to prepare Al2O3-modified LNMO cathode materials. The Al2O3-modified LNMO materials were synthesized via a one-step solid-state reaction and then modified with Al2O3 via a wet chemical technique. The impacts of Al2O3 modification on the structure and electrochemical properties of LNMO materials were examined by X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, charge-discharge tests, cyclic voltammetry measurements, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and aging tests. Throughout the modification process, several Al3+ were noted to substitute for Ni2+, resulting in a decrease of Mn4+ to Mn3+; this increased the electronic conductivity and lowered the electrochemical polarization of the LNMO material. An amorphous Al2O3 coating layer developed on the surface of the LNMO particles in the modification, and this could alleviate the strike of HF caused by electrolyte decomposition as well as the development of a solid electrolyte interphase. Thus, the 0.5 wt% Al2O3-modified LNMO material had decreased R sf and R ct and greater D Li values with a rate capability and cycling stability better than LNMO. The rate capability was 105.6 and 83.3 mAh g–1 at high C rates of 5 C and 7 C, as opposed to 83.3 and 54.9 mAh g–1, respectively; the room temperature (25 °C) capacity retention was 92.6% at 1 C after 200 cycles, as opposed to 87.0%. The high-temperature (55 °C) capacity retention was 90.9% at 1 C rate after 200 cycles as opposed to 86.5%. Thus, this is an easy and feasible method to improve the electrochemical performance of LNMO cathode materials for industrialization.","Chang, Qian;Wei, Aijia;Li, Wen;Bai, Xue;Zhang, Lihui;He, Rui;Liu, Zhenfa",2019-03-31,Ceramics International,"Lithium-ion batteries,Cathode material,LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4,Al2O3 modification,Electrochemical performance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.213,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.213
Dynamic crack growth mechanism and lifetime assessment in plasma sprayed thermal barrier system upon temperature cycling,"Failure of plasma-sprayed thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) is very complicated upon temperature cycling, therefore, to ascertain the crack propagation behavior is beneficial to understand the failure mechanism and life prediction of TBCs. In this paper, a finite element model is developed by coupling the dynamic growth of thermally grown oxide and dynamic crack propagation to explore the failure of TBCs induced by the instability of the interface between top coat (TC) and bond coat (BC). The thermal cyclic lifetime is deduced by obtaining the thermal cycles corresponding to the occurrence of complete delamination. The influence of the non-uniformity of the interface on thermal cyclic lifetime is quantitatively evaluated. Sensitivity studies including the effects of constituent properties and crack distance to the interface on the thermal cyclic lifetime are further examined. The results show that the incipient cracks usually nucleate above the valley due to the large tensile stress, and the shear stress near the peak plays a very crucial role. The crack growth involves three stages with different fracture dominated-mode. The crack propagation behavior obtained by simulation is in line with that observed by experiments. The TBCs system with a uniform interface exhibits a longer thermal cyclic lifetime compared to the non-uniform interface. Coating optimization methods proposed in this work may provide an alternative option for developing a TBCs system with longer service lifetime.","Wei, Zhi-Yuan;Cai, Hong-Neng;Feng, Rui-Xue;Su, Jing-Yu",2019-08-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs),Thermally grown oxide (TGO) growth,Crack propagation,Non-uniform interface morphology,Thermal cyclic lifetime",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.223,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.223
Phase stabilization in plasma sprayed BaTiO3,"This paper presents a comparison of properties of BaTiO3 ceramics prepared by two different production methods: gas-stabilized plasma spraying (GSP) and spark plasma sintering (SPS). Samples of both materials were evaluated by various techniques, the goal being to detect the Curie temperature of the ferroelectric transformation between the tetragonal and the cubic phase. All tests, resonant ultrasound spectroscopy, dielectric measurements, differential scanning calorimetry and temperature-resolved X-ray diffraction (XRD), used in combination, proved the absence of this transformation in the case of GSP coating up to 500°C. Similarly, the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic transition temperature is shifted downwards, this transition probably taking place in a small fraction of the volume of coating. The SPS samples exhibit several anomalies, such as a strong anisotropy of relative permittivity, but their phase transformations were detected in the usual temperature ranges.","Ctibor, P.;Seiner, H.;Sedlacek, J.;Pala, Z.;Vanek, P.",2013-07-31,Ceramics International,"B.

The graphene nanosheets and the PPy coating can facilitate the electrons transfer rate, while the ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets can enhance the utilization efficiency of the active materials. The obtained MoS2/rGO-10 composite exhibits high reversible specific capacity (970 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1) and rate capability (capacity retention of 64% at 3.2 A g−1). Moreover, the PPy@MoS2/rGO hybrids reveal lower specific capacity but better rate capability, and a “trade-off” effect between electrons and ions transfer resistance was observed.

Fabrication of microwave absorbing CoFe2O4 coatings with robust superhydrophobicity on natural wood surfaces,"A superhydrophobic wood surface with microwave absorption property was prepared based on the formation of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles and subsequent hydrophobization using fluorinated alkylsilane (FAS).

The as-prepared superhydrophobic coatings on wood maintain stable superhydrophobicity after suffering a significant abrasion. Moreover, the complex permeability and permittivity of the coated wood composites were measured in the frequency range of 2–18GHz by vector network analysis.

The transmission electron micrograph (TEM) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images showed that ZnO quantum dots (QDs) and ZnO nanoflowers (NFs) had been assembled on the surfaces of ZnO nanorods (NRs) or in the upper parts of the gaps between the rods. The morphology of ZnO nanoflowers was formed through a general route of zero-dimensional (0D)→2D→3D, controlling by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) during the experiment. The blue-shifts of Raman and PL spectra were observed for the hybrid nanostructures at room temperature, which were explained by the quantum confinement effects. Compared with the photocatalytic activities of the samples, ZnO NRs@NFs showed enhanced photocatalytic performance for the degradation of RhB under UV radiation, which could be attributed to the special structural feature with an open and porous nanostructured surface layer and the surface defects. ZnO NRs@NFs would show a wider application for its particular porous morphology.","Liu, Xiaoyan;Cao, Jian;Yang, Lili;Wei, Maobin;Li, Xiuyan;Lang, Jihui;Li, Xuefei;Liu, Yang;Yang, Jinghai;Liu, Yaohui",2015-11-30,Ceramics International,"Hybrid nanostructures,Self-assembly,Optical property,Photocatalytic property",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.06.049,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.06.049
Comparison of microstructure and oxidation behavior of La-Mo-Si coatings deposited by two approaches,"To investigate the effect of preparation methods on the La-Mo-Si (LMS) coatings, we developed a new LMS coating system using pack cementation (PC) and supersonic atmospheric plasma spraying (SAPS). Microstructure analysis showed that the SAPS-LMS coating possessed a higher porosity than that of the PC-LMS coating. Higher porosity can provide more channels to the oxidative and corrosive gasses to permeate the SAPS-LMS ceramic top-coat. After static oxidation for 150h under 1773K, the mass loss of SAPS-LMS coating (3.12wt%) was much higher than that of the PC-LMS coating (0.05wt%), and the parabolic rate constants presented faster oxidation kinetic in SAPS-LMS coating with respect to the PC-LMS coating. These results revealed that the protection effectiveness of SAPS-LMS coating was inferior to PC-LMS coating. Compared with SAPS-LMS coating, microscopic pores and cracks appeared in the PC-LMS coating with a thicker oxide film, which benefits from the formed La-Si-O-Al glass oxide with an excellent ability for crack healing. The reasons for poor antioxidant performance of SAPS-LMS coating are the higher volatility of La-Si-O glass containing Mo5Si3 and a weak interfacial interaction between coatings and substrate.","Wang, Changcong;Li, Kezhi;Shi, Xiaohong;Huo, Caixia;He, Qinchuan",2017-10-01,Ceramics International,"La-Mo-Si coating,Pack cementation,Plasma spraying,Porosity,Oxidation behavior",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.114,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.114
Oxyacetylene torch ablation resistance of Co-modified WC coating deposited on C/C composites by supersonic atmosphere plasma spraying,"Cobalt (Co) was chosen as an additive to improve the ablation resistance of WC coating for SiC coated C/C composites, SiC modified WC coating and pure WC coating which were prepared and tested for comparative purposes. Results showed that the thermal shock resistance of WCC (WC-10%Co) coating was better than pure WC coating and WCS (WC-10%SiC) coating. Furthermore, the produced oxide layer on WCC coating was found to be more stable due to the reaction of CoO and WO3. As a result, during oxyacetylene torch ablation test, compared with pure WC coating and WCS coating, WCC coating keeps excellent dimensional stability with the linear ablation rate decreased by 67% and 62%, respectively, showing a significant improvement of the ablation resistance.","Guo, Ling-jun;Peng, Jian;Kou, Gang;Shi, Guo-ge;Dong, Kai-yuan",2017-08-15,Ceramics International,"Tungsten carbide,Cobalt,Silicon carbide,Carbon/carbon composites,Supersonic atmosphere plasma spraying",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.040,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.040
Microstructure evolution and high temperature corrosion behavior of FeCrBSi coatings prepared by laser cladding,"In this study, an FeCrBSi coating was deposited on a stainless steel substrate by laser cladding with a 6 kW CO2 laser to improve the hardness and corrosion resistance. The phase composition, microstructure evolution and chemical composition of the coating were investigated via X-ray diffraction (XRD), confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). Microhardness and high temperature corrosion tests in molten aluminum were also conducted for evaluating the properties of the coating. The XRD pattern suggested that the coating was particularly composed of martensite, (Fe, Cr)7C3 and CrFeB hard phases. The microstructure results exhibited that equiaxed dendrites, dendrite networks, columnar dendrites, cellular and planar grains were distributed from the surface to the bottom of the coating. The hardness of the substrate increased from 217 HV0.2 to 762 HV0.2. Moreover, the laser cladding FeCrBSi coating exhibited good corrosion resistance in molten aluminum, thereby making it a promising candidate in the surface modification and protection of hot dip aluminum equipment.","Wang, Qian;Chen, Fa Qiang;Zhang, Liang;Li, Ji Dong;Zhang, Jun Wei",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"Laser cladding,FeCrBSi coating,Microstructure evolution,Corrosion behavior,Molten aluminum",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.010
"Al2O3/Si3N4 nanocomposite coating on aluminum alloy by the anodizing route: Fabrication, characterization, mechanical properties and electrochemical behavior","An Al2O3/Si3N4 nanocomposite coating was successfully fabricated on commercial aluminum alloy. Hardness measurements, polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were employed to study the mechanical and corrosion behaviors of the coatings. Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) equipped with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were utilized to characterize the surface morphology and phase composition of the coatings. Also, coatings abrasive wear properties were evaluated with a modified ASTM G105 standard. FE-SEM image, EDS and XRD analysis revealed the presence of Si3N4 in the coating. Furthermore, the results showed hardness of the coatings to increase from 380±50HV for the anodized layer to 712±36HV for the composite coatings that were formed in an electrolyte containing 6gr/lit Si3N4 nanoparticles. Electrochemical measurements indicated that corrosion resistance of the nanocomposite coating significantly increased compared to the anodized coating. In addition, the effect of Si3N4 nanoparticles into the nanocomposite coatings on abrasive wear mechanism and mass loss rate of the coatings was investigated.","Mohammadi, Iman;Afshar, Abdollah;Ahmadi, Shahab",2016-08-01,Ceramics International,"Anodizing,Si3N4 nanoparticles,Nanocomposite coating,Hardness,Wear resistance,Electrochemical behavior",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.142,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.142
Microstructure and oxidation resistance of a multiphase Mo-Si-B ceramic coating on Mo substrates deposited by a plasma transferred arc process,"To improve the oxidation resistance of a Mo substrate, a multiphase Mo-Si-B ceramic coating was deposited using a plasma transferred arc (PTA) process. The phase constituents, microstructure, and oxidation resistance of the coating were investigated. The results show that the microstructure of the Mo-Si-B coating is characterised by rod-like Mo5SiB2 dendrites, a lamellar structure of Mo3Si/Mo5SiB2 binary eutectics, and cellular Mo5Si3 dendrites. Compared with the Mo substrate, the Mo-Si-B coating exhibits a significant improvement in the oxidation resistance at 1300 °C in an air atmosphere. This is mainly owing to a dense and continuous borosilicate layer formed on the surface of the Mo-Si-B coating, which acts as an oxygen diffusion barrier. Moreover, it is observed that the Mo5SiB2 dendrites exhibit a higher oxidation resistance compared to Mo3Si/Mo5SiB2 eutectics during high-temperature oxidation exposure. The oxidation behaviour is discussed based on the oxidation kinetics and a cross-sectional microstructure analysis of the oxidised Mo-Si-B specimen.","Deng, Xinke;Zhang, Guojun;Wang, Tao;Ren, Shuai;Shi, Yao;Bai, Zhonglian;Cao, Qian",2019-01-31,Ceramics International,"PTA process,Mo-Si-B coating,Microstructure,Oxidation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.182,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.182
Improving room-temperature electrochemical performance of solid-state lithium battery by using electrospun La2Zr2O7 fibers-filled composite solid electrolyte,"Low ionic conductivity at room temperature and poor interfacial compatibility are the main obstacles to restrain the practical application of polymer solid electrolytes. In this work, lanthanum zirconate (LZO) fibers were prepared by electrospinning method and used for the first time as fillers in sandwich polypropylene carbonate (PPC)-based solid electrolyte. Meanwhile, a graphite coating was applied on one surface of the composite solid electrolyte (CSE) membrane. The results show that the LZO fibers significantly increases the room-temperature electrochemical performance of the CSE, and the graphite coating enhances the interfacial compatibility between electrolyte and lithium anode. Furthermore, an ultra-thin PPC-LZO CSE with a total thickness of 22 μm was prepared and used in NCM622/CSE/Li solid-state cell, which shows an initial discharge capacity of 165.6 mAh/g at the current density of 0.5C and a remaining capacity of 113.0 mAh/g after 250 cycles at room temperature. Rise to 1C, the cell shows an initial discharge capacity of 154.2 mAh/g with a remaining capacity of 95.6 mAh/g after 250 cycles. This ultra-thin CSE is expected to be widely applied in high energy-density solid-state battery with excellent room-temperature electrochemical performances.","Jing, Mao-xiang;Yang, Hua;Han, Chong;Chen, Fei;Yuan, Wei-yong;Ju, Bo-wei;Tu, Fei-yue;Shen, Xiang-qian;Qin, Shi-biao",2019-10-15,Ceramics International,"Solid-state battery,Composite solid electrolyte,Lanthanum zirconate fiber,Sandwich structure,Interface,Room-temperature performance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.085,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.085
Plasma spray deposition of fly ash onto mild steel substrates using a fractional factorial design approach,"In this study, fly ash was used as a feedstock material for atmospheric plasma spray deposition onto commercial marine-grade mild steel substrates. The experiments were conducted according to a fractional factorial design with four process parameter variables: the primary and carrier gas pressures, the powder feed rate and the plasma power. The results obtained indicate that the primary gas pressure was the most significant factor affecting the thickness and surface roughness of the deposited coatings, whereas the microhardness was affected by the primary gas pressure, the plasma power and the interaction between the primary gas pressure and the powder feed rate.","Muhammad, M.M.;Isa, M.C.;Shamsudin, R.;Jalar, A.",2014-09-30,Ceramics International,"Fly ash,Atmospheric plasma spray,Fractional factorial design,Deposited coatings",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.05.090,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.05.090
Design and development of CaO–SiO2–CaF2 and CaO–SiO2–Al2O3 based electrode coatings to weld low alloy ferritic steels for power plant applications,"Dissimilar welding of low alloy ferritic steel to martensitic or stainless steels is an essential requirement in modern thermal and nuclear power plants. Shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) is most commonly used to weld dissimilar metals using the flux coated electrodes. Suitable filler wire selection and electrode coating composition play an important role along with the welding parameters on the quality of welded joints. These parameters also affect the mechanical properties of the welded joints. This article deals with design and development of electrode coatings for joining low alloy steels. Electrode coatings were developed using CaO–SiO2–CaF2 and CaO–SiO2–Al2O3 flux systems with the help of mixture design and extreme vertices approach. Twenty one multipass weld beads were made using developed shielded metal arc welding electrodes. Weld chemistry was obtained using spectrometer for all the twenty-one welds. Microstructural and microhardness analysis was performed on all the welded specimens to observe the metallurgical and mechanical behavior of the welds. Multi-response optimization was carried out to obtain optimum flux composition. The effect of individual constituents and their interactions on the weld chemistry, grain size, and microhardness has been investigated.","Mahajan, Sumit;Chhibber, Rahul",2019-12-15,Ceramics International,"Dissimilar weld,Shielded metal arc welding (SMAW),Electrode coating composition,Extreme vertices design,Multi-objective optimization",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.124,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.124
Enhanced electrochemical performance of core-shell Li4Ti5O12/PTh as advanced anode for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries,"A nanocomposite of Li4Ti5O12 particles coated with polythiophene (PTh) was fabricated as advanced anode for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. The conducting PTh layer was successfully coated on the surface of Li4Ti5O12 through the in-situ oxidative polymerization method. Benefiting from the core-shell structure, specific capacities as high as 171.5, 168.2 and 151.1mAhg−1 at 0.2, 1 and 10 C are obtained in the Li4Ti5O12/PTh composite. The electrochemical results also show that the Li4Ti5O12/PTh exhibits remarkably improved cycling performance as compared with the Li4Ti5O12 anode. Moreover, the charge-transfer resistance of Li4Ti5O12/PTh electrode is much lower than that of the bare Li4Ti5O12, revealing that the PTh coating can significantly increase the electron conductivity between the Li4Ti5O12 particles. The excellent electrochemical performance of the as-fabricated Li4Ti5O12/PTh composite can be ascribed to the PTh layer which can suppress the dissolution of active material into the LiPF6 electrolyte and enhance the electron conductivity of Li4Ti5O12 nanocrystals. Thus, the Li4Ti5O12/PTh composite is an advanced anode for use in high performance lithium-ion batteries application.","Xu, Dong;Wang, Peifeng;Yang, Rui",2017-07-31,Ceramics International,"Lithium-ion batteries,Li4Ti5O12 anode,PTh layer,Nanocomposite,Electrochemical performance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.053,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.053
"Effect of heat treatment condition on magnetic, electrical transport and magnetoresistance properties of La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 manganite coatings","Effects of three different heat treatment conditions (air, vacuum and nitrogen) on the structure, magnetic, electrical transport and low-field magnetoresistance behaviors of La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 manganite coatings synthesized by sol-gel and screen printing methods have been systematically investigated. The detailed crystallographic analyses revealed that the diffraction peak positions of the samples subjected to annealing in vacuum and nitrogen ambients shifted to lower-angle regions, and lattice parameters and structure distortion increased as compared with those of the sample annealed in air, which were due to the introduction of oxygen deficiency under the annealing conditions of vacuum and nitrogen. The content of oxygen deficiency of the samples could be determined by the change of lattice parameters. Furthermore, the vacuum and nitrogen annealed samples exhibited a dramatic increase in the resistivity, accompanied by the reduction in ferromagnetism, the resistivity peak temperature and the ferromagnetism transition temperature. These phenomena were attributed to the decrease of average manganese oxidation state, as a result the mobile charge carriers were reduced, the ferromagnetic coupling and the double exchange effect between manganese ions decreased while the magnetic inhomogeneity increased. In the meanwhile, magnetoresistance ratios of the oxygen-deficient samples were enhanced around the percolation threshold.","Zhou, Yu;Zhu, Xinde;Li, Shengli",2018-09-30,Ceramics International,"Manganite,Heat treatment,Electrical transport,Magnetoresistance,Oxygen deficiency",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.130,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.130
Carbothermic reduction synthesis of calcium hexaboride using PVA-calcium hexaborate mixed gels,"In this study, PVA-CaB6O10·5H2O precursor mixtures were prepared by coating the ceramic powders with PVA to synthesize CaB6 via carbothermal reduction. Boron loss, the main problem in the synthesis of borides, was reduced by the use of metastable CaB6O10 as a transitional phase which is stable until the critical temperature ranges where the boron sub-oxides have higher volatilities. To minimize boron loss, due to the high hydrophilicity and ability to form cross-linked PVA-borate gels, PVA was used as a carbon source and carbon coating process was carried out via pyrolysis of the PVA - CaB6O10·5H2O mixed gels. The effect of the molecular weight of PVA on the CaB6 synthesis was also studied. Because of highly efficient interaction of CaB6O10·5H2O with the PVA60-water solution, PVA60 was found to be the optimal carbon source. The CaB6O10·5H2O-PVA60 composite powder was characterized by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and the effect of molecular weight of the PVA’s on the thermal characteristics of mixed powders were analyzed by using simultaneous thermal analysis (STA). The effect of carbothermic reduction temperature and dwell time on the phase formation were examined via x-ray diffractometer (XRD) and scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) techniques. The optimum synthesis conditions were determined for the formation of CaB6 as 1450ºC for 12h under an Argon flow by using the CaB6O10·5H2O-PVA60 mixed precursor.","Yilmaz, Duygu;Savaci, Umut;Koç, Nurşen;Turan, Servet",2018-02-15,Ceramics International,"Powders: Chemical preparation,Borides,Platelets,Carbothermal Reduction",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.050,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.050
The effect of the surface nanostructure and composition on the antiwear properties of zirconia–titania coatings,"This study describes the preparation, surface imaging and tribological properties of titania coatings modified by zirconia nanoparticles agglomerated in the form of island-like structures on the titania surface. Titania coatings and titania coatings with embedded zirconia nanoparticles were prepared by the sol–gel spin coating process on silicon wafers. After deposition the coatings were heat-treated at 500°C or 1000°C. The natural tendency of nanoparticles to form agglomerates was used to build separated island-like structures unevenly distributed over the titania surface having the size of 1.0–1.2μm. Surface characterization of coatings before and after frictional tests was performed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and optical microscopy. Zirconia nanoparticles were imaged with the use of transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The tribological properties were evaluated with the use of microtribometer operating in ambient air at technical dry friction conditions under normal load of 80mN. It was found that nanocomposite coatings exhibit lower coefficient of friction (CoF) and considerably lower wear compared to titania coating without nanoparticles. The lowering of CoF is about 40% for coatings heated at 500°C and 33% for the coatings heated at 1000°C. For nanocomposites the wear stability was enhanced by a factor of 100 as compared to pure titania coatings. We claim that enhanced tribological properties are closely related to the reduction of the real contact area, lowering of the adhesive forces in frictional contacts and increasing of the composite hardness. The changes in materials composition in frictional contact has secondary effect.","Piwoński, Ireneusz;Soliwoda, Katarzyna;Kisielewska, Aneta;Stanecka-Badura, Renata;Ka¸dzioła, Kinga",2013-03-31,Ceramics International,"B.

The upper region of the clad is a pure ZrO2 ceramic layer, and the lower region is an excellent transition layer of Ni-base alloy. The ZrO2 ceramic layer exhibits equiaxed grains and columnar structure of t' phase and a tiny network structure of m phase along the t' boundaries.

Al2O3/CrAlSiN multilayer coating deposited using hybrid magnetron sputtering and atomic layer deposition,"In this study, Al2O3/CrAlSiN multilayer coatings with various periods were prepared using a hybrid process involving overlapping magnetron sputtering of CrAlSiN and atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al2O3. The influence of the number of Al2O3 layers on the mechanical properties, corrosion behavior and oxidation characteristics of the coatings was studied using nano/micro indentation, electrochemical corrosion, and high temperature static oxidation tests. The results show that the multilayer structure can effectively prevent crack propagation during the coating and subsequently increase the coating toughness. A substantial improvement in the resistance to electrochemical and oxidation corrosion was observed in the Al2O3/CrAlSiN multilayer coatings and increasing the number of Al2O3 layers dramatically increases the corrosion durability. The Al2O3 ALD layers are expected to inhibit the diffusion of corrosive substances such as ions and oxygen and the increase of the Al2O3 layer number decreases the diffusion fluxes of the coating elements to the surface and limit the oxide growth, resulting in the evolution of the oxidation produces from irregular particles to nano-walls/fibers. It is supposed that the PVD/ALD hybrid process may open a new hard coating design concept by providing a superior toughness and corrosion/oxidation resistance.","Dai, Wei;Wang, Qimin;Kim, Kwang-Ho;Kwon, Se-Hun",2019-06-15,Ceramics International,"Physical vapor deposition,Atomic layer deposition,Toughness,Corrosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.211,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.211

"Fabrication, mechanical properties and thermal shock resistance of a dense SiC NWs/α-Si3N4 composite coating for protecting porous Si3N4 ceramics","To prevent porous Si3N4 ceramics from absorbing moisture in practical application, a dense SiC NWs/α-Si3N4 composite coating was fabricated using the two-step technology involving slurry and liquid infiltration method. The results revealed that the SiC NWs not only can promote densification sintering of the coating but also can reduce thickness of the coating effectively due to the block effect of the SiC NWs. Furthermore, the SiC NWs in the coating had a good interfacial bonding with α-Si3N4 matrix, meanwhile the toughening effects of the SiC NWs involving crack deflection, crack branching, SiC NWs bridging and pullout, also presented during mechanical damage. The strengthening and toughening mechanisms of the SiC NWs not only enhanced mechanical properties of the coating but also raised significantly critical crack size (L), thereby which made the coating have a good ability for thermal shock resistance. After thermal shock at ΔT = 1000 °C for 15 times, water absorption of the coated porous Si3N4 ceramics increased only to 7.21% from 4.54%, and its residual strength ratio was up to 83.4%. More importantly, the coating exhibited an ability for crack healing during thermal shock testing. All those above results indicated that as-prepared SiC NWs/α-Si3N4 composite coating can meet the applied requirements in long-term extreme conditions.","Wang, Binglei;Shangguan, Duandan;Qiao, Ruiqing;Zhang, Fan;Bai, Yu;Wang, Zhanjie;Wang, Chao;Lu, Xuefeng",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Porous Si3N4 ceramic,The SiC NWs-toughened coating,Mechanical properties,Thermal shock resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.020,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.020
Solution-processed ytterbium oxide dielectrics for low-voltage thin-film transistors and inverters,"High permittivity (high k) metal-oxide thin films fabricated via solution processes have recently received much attention for the construction of low-operating voltage and high-performance thin-film transistors (TFTs). In this report, amorphous ytterbium oxide (Yb2O3) thin films were fabricated by spin coating and their applications in TFTs were explored. The physical properties of the solution-processed Yb2O3 thin films processed at different annealing temperatures were systematically investigated using various characterization techniques. To explore the feasibility of the Yb2O3 thin films as gate dielectrics for oxide TFTs, In2O3 TFTs based on Yb2O3 dielectrics were integrated. All the devices could be operated at 3V, which is critical for the applications in portable, battery-driven, and low-power electronic devices. The optimized In2O3/Yb2O3 TFT exhibits high electrical performances, including field-effect mobility of 4.98cm2/Vs, on/off current ratio of ~ 106, turn-on voltage around 0V, and subthreshold swing of 70mV/decade, respectively.

Two kinds of the SiC and ZrC composite coating layers were fabricated with other source gas fraction. The composite coating layer, with a similar ratio of SiC and ZrC, which was observed in the SEM microstructure, was fabricated, and each phase was confirmed by XRD, Raman, and TEM analysis. Only the SiC and ZrC phases were co-deposited; the ZrSi and free carbon phases were not. The composite coating layer with very small ZrC particles embedded in a SiC matrix was fabricated by decreasing the ZrCl4 source gas ratio.

Preparation processes and characterizations of alumina-coated alumina support layers and alumina-coated natural material-based support layers for microfiltration,"Recently, porous ceramic membranes have become a subject of significant interest due to their outstanding thermal and chemical stability. To reduce the high manufacturing costs of these porous ceramic membranes, recent research has focused on the utilization of inexpensive natural materials. However, there have not been any well-established direct comparisons of the membrane properties between typical alumina-based membranes and novel natural material-based membranes. Therefore, we compared alumina-coated alumina support layers (with average pore sizes ranging from 0.10µm ~0.18µm), alumina-coated diatomite-kaolin composite support layers (with an average pore size of 0.12µm), and alumina-coated pyrophyllite-diatomite composite support layers (with an average pore size of 0.11µm) via the dip-coating method and subsequent heat treatment ranging from 1200°C–1400°C for 1h. The pure water permeability of the alumina-coated diatomite-kaolin composite support layer and the alumina-coated pyrophyllite-diatomite composite support layer was found to be approximately 2.0×102 Lm−2 h−1 bar−1, which is similar to that of an alumina-coated alumina support layer. Therefore, we suggest that the average pore size of an alumina-coated natural material-based support layer can be effectively controlled while exhibiting acceptable water permeability.","Ha, Jang-Hoon;Abbas Bukhari, Syed Zaighum;Lee, Jongman;Song, In-Hyuck;Park, Chanhyuk",2016-09-30,Ceramics International,"Alumina coating,Diatomite-kaolin composite support layer,Pyrophyllite-diatomite composite support layer,Pore characteristics,Microfiltration",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.181,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.181
"Non-fluorinated, room temperature curable hydrophobic coatings by sol–gel process","Non-fluorinated hydrophobic silica surfaces were generated on soda lime glass (SLG) substrates using hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) as a surface modifying agent. Silica coatings were fabricated by dip coating of a sol derived from base catalyzed hydrolysis and condensation of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS). Two methodologies were adopted to generate the hydrophobic surface; one where the hydrophilic silica coated surface was treated by immersion into different concentrations of alcoholic solutions of HMDS varying from 2.5wt% to 15wt%. In the other method, HMDS was directly added to a mixture of TEOS, water, ethanol, and ammonium hydroxide and coatings were deposited using this sol by dip coating and spray coating. Water contact angles (WCA) were measured to study the effect of HMDS treatment times and concentrations on hydrophobicity in the first case, and in the second case, WCA were measured for dip and spray coated samples. UV–visible transmission, scratch resistance, and thermal stability of the coatings were determined. The WCA increased from 66±2° to 125±4° after the treatment of the silica coatings with HMDS. In case of coatings generated from direct addition of HMDS to silica sol, WCA varied from 145±2° to 166±4° for dip and spray coated surfaces respectively. Surface morphology was studied to explain the difference in hydrophobicity of coatings generated using the two methods.","Jeevajothi, K.;Crossiya, D.;Subasri, R.",2012-05-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Toward hard yet tough VC coating via modulating compressive stress and nanostructure to enhance its protective performance in seawater,"VC nanocomposite coatings with high carbon content were deposited by multi-arc ion plating at varied substrate bias voltages ranging from − 50 to − 250 V. There is a comprehensive study as to coating preparation and corresponding microstructure, phase contents and their relationship with mechanical properties. The results show that carbon bonding is significantly affected by bias voltage. For the coatings deposited at high bias voltage, the appropriate combination of inducing compressive stress and manipulating the nanostructure accounts for the effect of hardening and toughening. The tribological and corrosive responses of nanocomposite VC coatings are implemented in the condition of seawater. The hard yet tough nanocomposite structure makes the coatings have favorable wear resistance. Moreover, the smooth surface and dense structure obtained at high bias voltage jointly improve capacity of anti-corrosion resistance. The results are beneficial to the potential application of VC nanocomposite coating in seawater.","Jiang, Xin;Zhao, Daqiang;Wang, Yongxin;Duan, Wenshan;Wang, Liping",2019-01-31,Ceramics International,"VC nanocomposite coatings,Hardening and toughening,Tribological property,Corrosion behavior,Seawater condition",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.284,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.284
Tailoring of the electrical properties of carbon black–silica coatings for de-icing applications,"Electrical heating properties of carbon black–silica composite coatings have been studied for de-icing devices. Coatings are consolidated by spray deposition onto tile substrates and thermal treated in the temperature range of 300–500°C in air atmosphere. The electrical properties of the coatings depend on the thermal treatment as for higher sintering temperatures the coatings are more resistive, and consequently the heating produced by the Joule effect is more significant. Therefore, it is possible to tailor the heating properties of the coatings by means the thermal treatment, achieving thin coatings with low electrical resistance (~5×10−4 Ωm), or coatings with higher resistivity (~5×10−3 Ωm) which produce thermal heating >70°C with heating rate >0.13°Cs−1. This coating heating is determined using DC intensity–voltage curves and thermal infrared camera. The relationship between electrical power and temperature increasing showed a nearly linear dependence. The experimental results for these coatings allow their use in a wide range of functional applications, such as de-icing devices for aeronautics.","Enríquez, E.;Fernández, J.F.;De Frutos, J.;De la Rubia, M.A.",2015-03-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Synthesis Ca-α-SiAlON powder by carbothermal reduction nitridation of colloidal sol-gel derived powder precursor,"Ca-α-SiAlON powder was prepared by carbothermal reduction nitridation process at nitrogen atmosphere without using high pressure and long holding time. The precursor was prepared by a novel colloidal sol-gel process consisting of silica, alumina, calcium oxide and carbon. The obtained powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The XRD and SEM analysis results revealed that by heating at 1200 °C for 2 h, spherical particles consisting of amorphous calcium aluminosilicate liquid phase were formed. With increasing temperature to 1360 °C and held for 2 h, the spherical particles with the dominant phase of O–SiAlON were observed. Finally, as the temperature climbed to 1500 °C and held for 2 h, spherical particles disappeared and Ca-α-SiAlON was formed. The XRD analysis of the products showed that with increasing temperature from 1360 °C to 1500 °C, O–SiAlON, β-SiAlON and Ca-α-SiAlON were formed, respectively, and colloidal sol-gel method, due to the high homogeneity of the reactants, had a significant role in increasing the purity of Ca-α-SiAlON.","Amin, M.;Ehsani, N.;Mozafarinia, R.",2019-10-01,Ceramics International,"Ca-α-SiAlON,Carbon coating,Dissolution of silica,Silanol,Combustion,Whisker",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.320,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.320

High internal phase emulsion as reaction medium for precipitating brushite crystals,"This present work was aimed at fabrication of brushite crystals using oil-in-water high internal phase emulsion as a reaction medium. The oil phase of more than 75wt.% was dispersed in the continuous aqueous phase. Due to the high oil volume fraction, the oil droplets were no longer spherical but were squeezed to take the shape of polyhedral. The morphology of the crystals was influenced by the structure of the emulsion and precursor concentration. The crystals were subjected to cytotoxicity test to ensure their compatibility with synoviocytes, which are cells that line the knee joints of rabbits. The crystals were able to sustain the cells for 5 days, which manifest their potential as osteoconductive coatings.","Lim, H.N.;Kassim, A.;Huang, N.M.;Lee, K.H.;Syahida, A.;Chia, C.H.",2010-07-31,Ceramics International,"E.

Thermomechanical properties and thermal cycle resistance of plasma-sprayed mullite coating and mullite/zirconia composite coatings,"Mullite coating and mullite/ZrO2 (10 and 20vol%) composite coatings were fabricated by atmospheric plasma spraying technique and their thermomechanical properties and thermal cycle resistance were analyzed in detail. Results show that the as-sprayed coatings consist of crystalline and amorphous phases, but isothermal heating at 1000°C can promote crystallization, thereby resulting in increased hardness and elastic modulus. The addition of ZrO2 in the coating composition changes the mullite crystallization behavior and increases the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) for heat-treated coatings. Below 1000°C, all the coatings show low thermal conductivity in the range of 0.9–1.7Wm−1 K−1, whereas it sharply increases at higher temperature because of the crystallization and formation of cracks. Owing to the increase of the CTE of the composite coatings, their thermal cycling performance improved significantly.","Li, Shuangjian;Zhao, Xiaoqin;Hou, Guoliang;Deng, Wen;An, Yulong;Zhou, Huidi;Chen, Jianmin",2016-11-15,Ceramics International,"Mullite/ZrO2,Plasma spraying,Thermomechanical properties,Thermal cycle resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.08.049,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.08.049
Preparation and characterization of multilayer anti-reflective coatings via sol-gel process,"Single layer and multilayer films consisting of SnO2, Ta2O5, SiO2, TiO2, indium tin oxide (ITO) and antimony tin oxide (ATO) have been prepared by sol-gel dip coating technique. All of the multilayer films contained a SiO2 top layer, which was composed of SiO2 nanoparticles. The other films had polymeric character. Obtained films were characterized by ellipsometry, XRD, AFM and SEM. Light transmittance values of the films were compared. Films other than SiO2 and Ta2O5 were found to have crystalline structure. Thickness values of the films were in the range of 30–115nm and roughness values were in 1.2–23nm range. Single layer porous silica provided 95% light transmittance, whereas ITO-TiO2-SiO2 multilayer film provided a light transmittance of 97.2%.","Kesmez, Ömer;Akarsu, Esin;Çamurlu, H.

Properties evolution of plasma-sprayed La2Zr2O7 coating induced by pore structure evolution during thermal exposure,"To study the inter-lamellar pores evolution under thermal exposure and how it affects the coating properties, free standing atmospheric plasma sprayed (APS) La2Zr2O7 (LZO) coating was subjected to thermal exposure at the temperatures of 1200°C and 1300°C for different durations. It was found that APS LZO coating experiences a rapid sintering during the early 5–20h of thermal exposure. Such microstructure evolution behavior was attributed to the presence of the lamellar structure, which contains most 2D pores with a small inter-lamellar spacing. As a result, the density, inter-lamellar bonding ratio, mechanical properties and thermal conductivity of the LZO coating remarkably increase in about 20h of thermal exposure. It was revealed that the evolution of the properties of the APS LZO coating during high temperature exposure is mainly ascribed to the shape change of the inter-lamellar pores for the formation of grain bridging in inter-lamellar pores.","Liu, Tao;Chen, Xu;Yang, Guan-Jun;Li, Chang-Jiu",2016-11-01,Ceramics International,"La2Zr2O7,Plasma spraying,Sintering,Properties,Pore morphology,Thermal barrier coatings",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.201,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.201
Phase and structure formation mechanisms of SHS synthesized composite coatings,"High performance composite coatings were synthesized by self-propagation high-temperature synthesis followed by gravitational-separation process based on thermite reaction. The phase, structure and composition of generated composite coatings were investigated, and formation mechanism was studied by thermodynamic analysis. Results showed that phase composition of Al-Fe2O3 reaction system consisted of Al2O3, Fe and FeAl2O4. In Al-Fe2O3/Al-Cr2O3 composite reaction system, Fe-Cr alloy was formed and FeAl2O4 phase disappeared, which could improve the corrosion resistance of composite coatings. Furthermore, the addition of SiO2 in SHS reaction favored the formation of low-melting point phase Al2O3·SiO2, which filled into voids of Al2O3 dendrites and reduced the porosity of composite coatings, thus improving their strength and densification level. Moreover, the generated transition structure in different reaction systems could buffer the residual stress to promote the binding between the composite coating and steel pipe.","Hou, Xinghui;Yu, Jingkun",2018-05-31,Ceramics International,"Composite coating,SHS-GS method,Corrosion resistance,Low-melting point phase,Densification",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.241,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.241
Polymerization-induced phase separation in the preparation of macroporous TiO2/SiO2 thin films,Macroporous TiO2/SiO2 (TS) composite thin films deposited on glass substrates were successfully prepared through a versatile template-free sol–gel approach based on the hydrolysis and polycondensation of tetrabutyl titanate and tetraethyl orthosilicate. A theoretic explanation for the formation of porous morphology was discussed in relation to the polymerization-induced phase separation and the concurrent sol–gel transition. The mechanism of phase separation was attributed to the spinodal decomposition. The field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) results indicate that the surface morphologies of TS thin films strongly depend on the amount of SiO2 sols (mole fraction) and aging time before spin-coating. A systemic method of long-range pore size tailoring for macroporous TS composite thin film was achieved by adjusting mole ratio of TiO2 to SiO2 and the aging time.,"Situ, Yue;Huang, Tao;Chen, Yanfeng;Huang, Weixin;Huang, Hong",2014-01-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Effects of oxygen and water vapor on the formation and growth of silica layer beneath barium strontium aluminosilicate coatings,"Barium strontium aluminosilicate (BSAS)-coated C/SiC composites were corroded under environments containing varying H2O/O2 ratios at elevated temperatures. After corrosion, continuous thermally grown silica oxide (silica-TGO) was formed at the BSAS coating/SiC bond coat interface, and the thickness of this layer increased with the corrosion time prolonged. The growth kinetics of the silica-TGO layer formed beneath the BSAS coating upon corrosion with a 50%H2O–50%O2 flowing gas mixture at elevated temperatures were examined. The results revealed that this silica-TGO layer beneath BSAS grew following a parabolic behavior, in line with a diffusion-controlled growth process. Based on the calculated growth rates and the activation energies of the silica-TGO layer, oxygen ion was identified as the main oxidant. The corrosion experiments under flowing gas mixtures containing varying H2O/O2 ratios revealed that water vapor was also involved in the growth of the silica-TGO layer.","Lu, Yonghong;Wang, Yiguang",2018-05-31,Ceramics International,"Environmental barrier coatings,Thermally grown silica oxide,Oxidants,Diffusion controlled processes",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.062,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.062
Thermal properties of plasma-sprayed thermal barrier coating with bimodal structure,"Nanostructured zirconia coatings have been prepared by atmospherical plasma spraying (APS) on NiCrAlY-coated superalloy substrates. The isothermal oxidation test results indicate that the oxidation kinetics of nanostructured TBC follows a parabolic law and the oxidation resistance of the nanostructured TBC is comparable to that of the conventional TBC. The nanostructured thermal barrier coatings exhibit excellent thermal cyclic resistance and low thermal diffusivity. The failure of the nanostructured TBC occurs within the top coat and close to the YSZ/thermal growth oxide interface. The thermal diffusivity of the coating is 90% of that of conventional thermal barrier coatings, and it increases after heat treatment at 1050°C for 34h. The increase in the thermal diffusivity of the coating is ascribed to grain growth, the crack healing as well as sintering neck formation.","Yu, Qinghe;Rauf, Abdul;Wang, Na;Zhou, Chungen",2011-04-30,Ceramics International,"Nanostructure,Thermal barrier coating,Thermal diffusivity,Oxidation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2010.11.033,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2010.11.033
The effect of argon shielding gas at plasma spray process on the structure and properties of MoSi2 coating,"In this work, MoSi2 powder was agglomerated for using it in atmospheric plasma spray (APS) process. MoSi2 coatings were manufactured by APS and argon-shrouded plasma spray (ASPS) processes. Phase composition and structural properties of coatings were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Also, the mechanical properties of coatings (such as microhardness and adhesion strength) were evaluated. Using the ASPS method, the coatings were found to have a low porosity and highly homogeneous structure. In addition, the argon protection gas was used to prevent the oxidation of the powder. Finally, the ASPS method revealed better microhardness and bending strength results for the corresponding tests.","Erfanmanesh, Mohammad;Reza Bakhshi, Saeed;Khajelakzay, Mohammad;Salekbafghi, Mostafa",2014-04-30,Ceramics International,"MoSi2 coating,Atmospheric plasma spray,Agglomeration,Argon shielding gas",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.08.128,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.08.128
Molarity dependent oscillatory structural and magnetic behavior of phase pure BiFeO3 thin films: Sol–gel approach,"An extensive study of oscillatory response of structural and magnetic behavior of phase pure bismuth iron oxide (BiFeO3) thin films is reported in the present study. Sol-gel method is used to synthesize BiFeO3 sols at room temperature. Molarity, being an important parameter in chemical synthesis, is varied (0.25 M, 0.3 M, 0.35 M, 0.4 M, 0.45 M, 0.5 M, 0.55 M and 0.6 M) and the effect is investigated in detail. Spin coated thin films are structurally studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) method. Films prepared using 0.35 M and 0.5 M sols confirm the formation of pure hexagonal phase of perovskite structure with R3c (161) space group. Strengthening of BiFeO3 phase is observed after magnetic field annealing (MFA) of samples at 300 °C for 2 hours. Mixed bismuth iron oxide phases (i.e. bismuth rich or deficient) are observed in thin films prepared using rest of the sols. Preferred orientation oscillates between (122) and (315) as a function of the appearance of pure and mixed BiFeO3 phases, respectively. Refined XRD parameters show -ive tilt in bond angle (i.e. ~ -7.148°) in the films with mixed bismuth iron oxide phases. Whereas, +ive tilt (i.e. 2.55° and 4.49°) in bond angles are responsible for the appearance of phase pure bismuth iron oxide phase at 0.35 M and 0.5 M sol concentration. Room temperature ferromagnetic behavior with high value of saturation magnetization is observed for films prepared using 0.35 M (109 emu/cm3) and 0.5 M (135 emu/cm3) sols. Law of approach to saturation magnetization is used to calculate magneto crystalline anisotropy.","Awan, Attia;Nadeem, M.;Riaz, Saira;Hussain, S.

The design of zirconium and hafnium germanate interphase in SiCf/SiC composites,"Unidirectional SiCf/SiC minicomposites with SiC matrix derived by polymer-impregnation pyrolysis (PIP), reinforced with SiC fibers coated with zirconium or hafnium germanate were fabricated. Microdebonding indentation tests for SiCf/SiC composites with one- and multilayered germanate interphase were performed. Interfacial shear stress depending on the number of germanate interfacial layers and morphology was determined. The microstructure of the minicomposites and indented fracture surfaces were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was stated that an increase in the number of interfacial coatings leads to a decrease in the interfacial frictional stress in SiCf/SiC minicomposites with germanate interphases. The key factor of interphase weakening is the formation of a weak interlayer bonding within the interphase but not germanate layered crystal structure itself. Thus, bonding at the fiber/matrix boundary could be regulated by the number of layers of ZrGeO4 or HfGeO4 in the interphase zone.","Prokip, V.E.;Utkin, A.V.;Batraev, I.S.;Baklanova, N.I.",2017-04-01,Ceramics International,"Interphase,Zirconium germanate,Hafnium germanate,Ceramic matrix composites,SiC fiber,Sol-gel",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.039,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.039
Corrosion resistance and thermal-mechanical properties of ceramic pellets to molten calcium-magnesium-alumina-silicate (CMAS),"Because gas turbine engines must operate under increasingly harsh conditions, the degradation of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) by calcium-magnesium-alumina-silicate (CMAS) is becoming an urgent issue. Mullite (3Al2O3·2SiO2) is considered a potential material for CMAS resistance; however, the performance of mullite in the presence of CMAS is still unclear. In this study, mullite and Al2O3–SiO2 were premixed with yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) in different proportions, respectively. Porous ceramic pellets were used to conduct CMAS hot corrosion tests, and the penetration of molten CMAS and its mechanism were investigated. The thermal and mechanical properties of the samples were also characterized. It was found that the introduction of mullite and Al2O3–SiO2 mitigated the penetration of molten CMAS into the pellets owing to the formation of anorthite, especially at 45 wt% mullite/55 wt% YSZ. Compared with Al2O3–SiO2, mullite possesses a higher chemical activity and undergoes a faster reaction with CMAS, thus forming a sealing layer in a short time. Additionally, the thermal expansion coefficient, thermal conductivity, and fracture toughness of different samples were considered to guide the architectural design. Considering the CMAS corrosion resistance, thermal and mechanical performance of TBCs systematically, a TBC system with a multilayer architecture is proposed to provide a theoretical and practical basis for the design and optimization of the TBC microstructure.","Fang, Huanjie;Wang, Weize;Huang, Jibo;Ye, Dongdong",2019-11-30,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs),CMAS,Mullite,Corrosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.223,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.223
Preparation and characterization of TiO2–SiO2 nano-composite thin films,"TiO2 nanocrystalline particles dispersed in SiO2 have been prepared by the sol-gel method using titanium- and silicon-alkoxides as precursors. Nano-composite thin films were formed on the glass substrates by dip-coating technique and heat treated at temperatures up to 500 °C for 1 h. The size of the TiO2 nanocrystalline particles in the TiO2–SiO2 solution ranged from 5 to 8 nm. The crystalline structure of TiO2 powders was identified as the anatase phase. As the content of SiO2 increased, the anatase phase tended to be stabilized to higher temperature. TEM results revealed the presence of spherical TiO2 particles dispersed in a disk-shaped glassy matrix. Photocatalytic activity of the TiO2–SiO2 (1:1) thin films showed decomposition of ∼95% of methylene blue solution in 2 h and a contact angle of ∼10°. The photocatalytic decomposition of methylene blue increased and the contact angle decreased with the content of TiO2 phase. TiO2–SiO2 with the molar ratio of 1:1 showed a reasonable combination of adhesion, film strength, and the photocatalytic activity.","Kwon, Chul Han;Kim, Je Hun;Jung, In Sun;Shin, Hyunmin;Yoon, Ki Hyun",2003-12-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Phase transition and interface evolution of Al2O3/ZrO2 particles in plasma-sprayed coatings,"Alumina and zirconia ceramic particles exhibit high hardness and excellent wear resistance at high temperature, and hence are used as ceramic reinforcement phases in some plasma sprayed coatings. In this study, the interface evolution of a zirconia/alumina eutectic ceramic and the phase transition of zirconia in a plasma-sprayed coating were investigated. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy combined with focused-ion beam and energy dispersive X-ray were used to analyze the microstructure and composition of the ceramic interface. The results showed that the eutectic ceramic particles consisted of alumina (outer) and columnar zirconia (inner) before and after the plasma spraying process. The inner zirconia part showed the martensitic transformation of t-type zirconia to stripe-like m-type zirconia. After the plasma spraying, the interface between alumina and zirconia changed significantly, which formed a new oxide layer. The phase transition mechanism in the ceramic particle and oxide layer formation mechanism at the alumina/zirconia interface were investigated.","Huang, Taihong;Song, Peng;Li, Chao;Shu, Yongchun;Sun, Benshuang;Ji, Qiang;Arif, Muhammad;Yi, Jianhong",2020-06-01,Ceramics International,"Zirconia,Alumina,Interface,Phase transition,Plasma spraying",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.277,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.277
Deposition of boron-containing coatings by electron-beam evaporation of boron-containing targets,"Boron-containing films are promising materials for improving the hardness, wear-resistance and durability of mechanical parts used in industry. We describe a novel approach for deposition of such coatings – by using electron-beam evaporation of boron-containing target material (pure boron or boron nitride) in inert (helium) or chemically-active (oxygen, nitrogen, residual atmosphere) gases at medium vacuum. Boron-containing films deposited on titanium substrates were characterized using a nanohardness tester and a non-contact 3D profilometer. Elemental composition of the coatings was studied using raster electron microscope equipped with a device for EDX analysis. All boron-containing coatings provided significant improvement (by a factor of 4–16) in the microhardness of the substrate surface.","Yushkov, Yu.G.;Oks, E.M.;Tyunkov, A.V.;Corbella, C.;Zolotukhin, D.B.",2020-03-31,Ceramics International,"Boron-containing coatings,Electron beam deposition,Medium vacuum,Fore-vacuum plasma-cathode electron source",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.179,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.179
"Effect of nitrogen concentrations on optical, structural and mechanical properties of self organized a-C:N films","Low friction and surface hardness has become an important aspect to study and understand surface engineering of diamond like coating. Investigation of structural and mechanical properties of nitrogenated amorphous Diamond Like Carbon coating has been done. The cross-sectional microstructures, elemental compositions and various phase constituent of the coated layers under different processing conditions have been characterized. Films are deposited in presence of 5%–20% with the increasing rate of 5% and 40% of N2 partial pressure along with Ar gas. 20% N2 pressure shows a critical behavior in Raman spectroscopy and XPS. In this condition the film shows more uniform coating with vertical growth structures as well as brittle behavior. The micro-structural changes on the surface due to migration of N2 and its related surface properties have been examined. AFM studies clearly show that the percentage change in average roughness decreases to 17% as the film thickness increases at 20% N2 incorporation. The positive changes in its mechanical properties have been observed by Nano-indentation techniques. Significance of DLC coating in this condition is clearly seen with the increasing sp3compositions by XPS analysis. All results have been correlated and hence critical range of nitrogen partial pressure has been observed between 20%-23% to give similar sp3 fraction and hence properties that of pure DLC films.","Solomon, Infant;Shukla, Krishnanand;Bhatnagar, Mukul;Rane, Ramkrishna;Ranjan, Mukesh;Gourbilleau, Fabrice;Sarma, Arun",2020-06-15,Ceramics International,"Nitrogen incorporation,Hardness,Nano indentation,sp3 fraction,N/C ratio,Refractive index",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.163,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.163

It presents an initial discharge capacity as high as 170.8mAhg−1 at 1C, and even delivers an excellent initial capacity of 153.6mAhg−1 with capacity retention of 82.3% after 100 cycles at 5C. The results demonstrate that this novel modification with doping followed by hybrid layer coating is an ideal design to obtain both high capacity and long cycle performance for Li3V2(PO4)3 and other polyanion cathode materials in lithium ion batteries.","Sun, Hua-Bin;Zhang, Lu-Lu;Yang, Xue-Lin;Huang, Yun-Hui;Li, Zhen;Zhou, Ying-Xian;Ding, Xiao-Kai;Liang, Gan",2016-11-15,Ceramics International,"Lithium ion battery,Lithium vanadium phosphate,Fe-doping,Hybrid layer coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.075,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.075
Synthesis and characterization of Co and Ga co-doped ZnO thin films as an electrode for dye sensitized solar cells,"Using a time efficient and cost effective approach so called sol‒gel dip coating route, we deposited thin films of ZnO and 1% Co & (0%, 0.5%, 1%, and 1.5%) Ga co-doped ZnO on the fluorine doped tin oxide substrates. All the films exhibited hexagonal wurtzite structure. X-rays study revealed that crystallite size increased with increase of doping. Optical parameters like absorbance, transmittance, refractive index, band gap, extinction coefficient and dielectric constants were measured using UV–Vis spectroscopy and it has been noticed that doping resulted in reduction of band gap. It has also been observed that, the films prepared with 1% Co & 1% Ga co-doped ZnO have comparatively smaller band gap and thus have high refractive index and high transmittance in visible region. The calculation of different electrically important factors for instance, high current density, small open circuit voltage, efficiency and fill factor revealed that co-doped ZnO with 1% Co and 1% Ga has relatively high efficiency of 2.43% and thus shows the potential of this composition as an electrode for solar cell devices.","Khan, M.I.;Naeem, Muhammad;Mustafa, Ghulam M.;Abubshait, Samar A.;Mahmood, Asif;Al-Masry, Waheed;Al-Garadi, Najib Y.A.;Ramay, Shahid M.",2020-12-01,Ceramics International,"Co,Ga,Dye sensitized solar cells,Optical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.127,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.127
Carbide-bonded graphene coated zirconia for achieving rapid thermal cycling under low input voltage and power,"Despite major advancement in coating graphene layers at material surfaces, challenges still exist towards achieving rapid heating and cooling under low energy consumption. Herein, atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) method was adopted to coat carbide-bonded graphene at the surface of zirconia substrate with a 2.7 cm diameter and a 1 cm thickness. The graphene coated zirconia substrate can achieve rapid thermal cycling with as high as approximately 50 °C/s of average heating rate at 150–320 °C temperature range using a low input voltage (12 V) and power (48 W). That is mainly due to the formation of highly qualified graphene and single-wall carbon nanotubes at the carburization layer, which is confirmed by the Raman spectra. The excellent electrothermal response characteristics is expectantly useful for rapid thermal cycling in injection molding thin-wall parts with high processing temperature (higher than 250 °C) under operation safety and low energy consumption, which is obviously absent in this emerging research area.","Wu, Min;Zhang, Lin;Cabrera, Eusebio Duarte;Pan, Jun-Jie;Yang, Hao;Zhang, Dan;Yang, Zhao-Gang;Yu, Jian-Feng;Castro, Jose;Huang, Han-Xiong;Lee, L.

Comparative study on effect of oxide thickness on stress distribution of traditional and nanostructured zirconia coating systems,"Numerical based assessment of traditional and nanostructured yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) thermal barrier coating systems (TBCs) has been carried out with varying thickness of thermally grown oxide (TGO). Radial, axial and shear stresses are determined for both coatings and are presented in comparison with few novel and interesting results. Elastic strain energy for TGO failure assessment is determined from calculated stress within TGO for varying thickness. Radial stresses at TGO/bond coat interface and maximum axial stresses in nanostructured zirconia coatings are found to be lower than in traditional YSZ up to a critical TGO thickness of 6 –7μm, after which stresses in nanostructured zirconia coatings increase considerably. However, radial compressive stresses in nanostructured TBCs are lower in all TGO thickness cases and shear stresses are slightly higher with relatively more prominent difference at high oxide thickness.","Abbas, Musharaf;Guo, Hongbo;Ramzan Shahid, Muhammad",2013-01-31,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs),Thermally grown oxides (TGO),Interfaces,Residual stress",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.06.051,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.06.051
Effect of TiO2 nanostructures on specific capacitance of Al2O3–TiO2 composite film on etched aluminum foil formed by the sol–gel and anodizing,"Nano-thin TiO2 film on etched aluminum foil was prepared by the Sol–gel dip-coating method and annealing post-treatment at different temperatures; then, Al2O3–TiO2 composite oxide film on etched aluminum foil was fabricated by anodization in 13wt% ammonium adipate solution. Nanostructures of TiO2 film were characterized by means of X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Raman Spectroscopy (RS), and Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). TiO2 nanostructured films are composed of anatase nanopartilces in size of 5–12nm as annealed at 400°C and 500°C, and anatase-rutile complex nanopartilces in 5–15nm at 600°C. Compared with pure anodic aluminum oxide film, TiO2 nanostructures effectively improved specific capacitance of the Al2O3–TiO2 composite oxide film on etched aluminum foil, with an increment ratio of about 8.6%, 24.6%, and 33.3%, caused by anatase and rutile content increasing with annealing temperature from 400°C, 500°C to 600°C, respectively.

A flexible nanostructured paper of MnO NPs@MWCNTs/r-GO multilayer sandwich composite for high-performance lithium-ion batteries,"Designing a high capacity and long cycle life MnO-based composite material for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) is still a great challenge because of the intrinsically low electrical conductivity and dramatic volume variations during lithiation/delithiation. In this paper, the MnO nanoparticles (MnO NPs) are recombined with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) to rationally construct a novel MnO NPs@MWCNTs/r-GO multilayer sandwich structure via electrostatic interaction self-assembly and vacuum filtration processes. As a result, the MnO NPs are closely attracted in the conductive MWCNTs network, and the MWCNTs adsorbed on the surface of MnO NPs can be served as a soft and flexible carbon coating layer to self-adapt the huge volume expansion. For another, the r-GO between two MnO NPs@MWCNTs layers is the cause to form a free-standing paper, enhancing the transverse conductivity of the whole electrode simultaneously. These features will contribute to achieve excellent cycling stability and improved rate capability.","Li, Ya;Wang, Panpan;Bao, Yunxia;Huang, Kai",2017-07-31,Ceramics International,"Manganese oxide,Multi-walled carbon nanotubes,Graphene,Electrostatic interaction",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.051,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.051
Al and Ga doped ZnO films prepared by a sol–gel spin coating technique,"ZnO is a promising material suitable for variety of novel electronic applications including sensors, transistors, and solar cells. Intrinsic ZnO film has inferiority in terms of electronic properties, which has prompted researches and investigations on doped ZnO films in order to improve its electronic properties. In this work, aluminium (Al) doped ZnO (AZO) and gallium (Ga) doped ZnO (GZO) films were coated on glass substrates by a sol–gel spin coating technique. AZO and GZO films were examined using XRD, AFM, FESEM, UV–vis spectroscopy, and Hall Effect measurement system to investigate the structural, morphology, optical transmittance, and electronic properties of the films. Highly c-axis oriented and transparent AZO and GZO films with distinct peak at 34.5° corresponding to (002) orientation were obtained. The decrease of (002) peak was observed with higher doping level. The optical transmittances in the visible region are in the range of 80–95%.

Bubble phenomenon of ZrB2 based composites at high temperatures,"Bubble phenomenon is common for ultra-high temperature ceramics (UHTCs) during oxidation or ablation processes, which will impair the oxidation/ablation resistant properties. This work is aiming to illuminate the formation and rupture processes of bubbles. In this work, ZrB2-SiC-WB composite coatings were prepared via vacuum plasma spray technique and oxidized at 1500 °C for different durations. Obvious bubble phenomenon was observed. The morphology and distribution of bubbles were characterized. The formation mechanism of bubbles was calculated and analyzed based on thermal dynamics. The results showed that B2O3 gas played a key role in affecting the bubble behaviors. Bubbles tended to nucleate near the interface between the solid and liquid oxide layers. Small bubbles aggregated to large bubbles near the outmost liquid layer. Large bubbles near the surface were easy to rupture. The calculated results were consistent with the observed results.","Li, Chong;Niu, Yaran;Liu, Tao;Zhong, Xin;Pan, Xiaohui;Zeng, Yi;Zheng, Xuebin;Ding, Chuanxian",2019-04-15,Ceramics International,"ZrB2 based composites,Bubble phenomenon,Formation mechanism,Oxidation,Ultra-high temperature ceramics",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.153,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.153
Microstructure and phase forming behaviour of chrome based multi-composition nitride coatings with nanolayer structures,"Nanoscale multilayer Cr–Nb–N hard coatings were fabricated by reactive hybrid physical vapour deposition (PVD), which was combined with arc ion plating (AIP) for depositing chromium (Cr) and an unbalanced magnetron (UBM) DC sputter for depositing niobium (Nb) on a steel substrate under a controlled gas mixture of Ar and N2. The phase evolution and microstructure of the coatings were analysed by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The formation behaviour of the multilayer structure of the coatings was changed using different rotation conditions for the substrate. The Cr–Nb–N coatings, which formed at a substrate rotation of 5 or 6rpm, exhibited modulation of the peaks approximately 36°, (111) plane, which indicated the formation of a superlattice in the XRD results. The superlattice structured Cr–Nb–N coating formed under the 5rpm rotation condition exhibits a large layer period (~25nm) and improved hardness (~35GPa) compared to other multilayer Cr–Nb–N or monolithic CrN coatings.","Yang, Young-Hwan;Yeo, In-Woong;Park, Sang-Jin;Oh, Yoon-Suk",2014-09-30,Ceramics International,"Nano-multilayer coating,Cr–Nb–N,Superlattice,Hybrid PVD",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.03.114,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.03.114
Magnetic and antibacterial studies of sol-gel dip coated Ce doped TiO2 thin films: Influence of Ce contents,"Ce-doped TiO2 thin films were synthesized by sol-gel dip coating route to evaluate the effect of Ce doping percentage on properties of TiO2. X-ray diffraction spectra revealed both anatase and brookite phases, and Ce doping favours the anatase–brookite transformation of TiO2 films. The optical constants of the thin films were achieved by evaluating spectroscopic UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometry data. The band gap of the Ce doped TiO2 was reduced from ~3.93 eV to ~3.79 eV with an increase in Ce doping percentage. All films have shown ferromagnetic behaviors which increase with the increase in Ce content due to enhancement in the bound magnetic polaron. Higher Ce doping increases the oxygen vacancies and saturation magnetization. Boost magnetic properties stem from the generation of the interaction between the Ce ion and an oxygen vacancy. The study showed that the antimicrobial activity of Ce doped TiO2 is ineffective. Hence doping of Ce can modify the properties of TiO2 and are used in LEDs, magneto-optical devices and solar cells.","Kayani, Zohra Nazir;Maria,;Riaz, Saira;Naseem, Shahzad",2020-01-31,Ceramics International,"TiO2,Phase transition,Photolumicience,Magnetic property,Optical property",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.272,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.272
Analysis of corrosion protection behavior of Al2O3-TiO2 oxide ceramic coating on carbon steel pipes for petroleum industry,"Corrosion is the deterioration of materials by chemical interaction with their environment. In the oil and gas industry, corrosion of the pipelines and other equipment is one of the leading causes of failure and the corrosion-related costs are very high. Hence, corrosion protection is an essential requirement. In this study, the objective is to analysis of the corrosion protection behavior of spray Alumina-Titania (Al2O3-TiO2) oxide ceramic coating on carbon steel pipes C45 using two different thermal spray coatings processes. These two different thermal spraying coating, High velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) and plasma thermal spraying techniques can be used instead of extensive treatment by expensive chemical formation of coatings on pipelines and equipment to improve or restore a component's surface properties or dimensions and to protect them from corrosion. Molten or semi-molten ceramic composite powders are sprayed on the surface in order to produce a dense coating layer. FESEM of coated samples showed that a high temperature of plasma coating method end in melting the ceramic powders and creation of completely melted regions on the coated samples’ surface compared to HVOF coating techniques. Corrosion testing of coated samples in seawater (3.5% NaCl) was conducted within 30 days. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) as well as potentiodynamic polarization outcomes represented that the corrosion resistivity of plasma coating technique for this type of ceramic composite is better than HVOF coating technique. However, both types of coating techniques are protecting the substrate against seawater.","Akhtari Zavareh, Mitra;Sarhan, Ahmed Aly Diaa Mohammed;Karimzadeh, Ramin;Singh, Ramesh Singh A./l.Kuldip",2018-04-15,Ceramics International,"High velocity oxygen fuel coating,Plasma coating,Alumina/Titania,Potentiodynamic polarization,EIS,FESEM",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.175,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.175

This could be attributed to the simultaneous effect of enhanced densification, presence of the transferred layer from the counterpart, strong interface between Al2O3, GNP and CNTs and toughening offered by the GNPs and CNTs. The lowest COF value of 0.27 was recorded on addition of 0.5 wt% of GNP in Al2O3 coating, which could be attributed to the graphitic lubrication on the worn track during the wear.","Priyadershini, Sony;Rahman, O.S.

Microstructure and oxidation resistance of C-AlPO4–mullite coating prepared by hydrothermal electrophoretic deposition for SiCC/C composites,"Oxidation resistant C-AlPO4–mullite coating for SiC pre-coated carbon/carbon composites (SiCC/C) was prepared by a novel hydrothermal electrophoretic deposition process. The phase composition, surface and cross-section microstructure of the as-prepared multi-layer coatings were characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The influence of deposition voltage on phase composition, microstructure and oxidation resistance of the as-prepared coatings was particularly investigated. Results show that the outer layer coating mainly composed of C-AlPO4 and mullite phase can be achieved after the hydrothermal electrophoretic deposition. The thickness, density and anti-oxidation property of the C-AlPO4–mullite coating was improved with the increase of deposition voltage from 160V to 200V. The multi-layer coating prepared at a voltage of 200V exhibit excellent anti-oxidation property, which can effectively protect C/C composites from oxidation in air at 1773K for 324h with a weight loss of 1.01%. The failure of the multi-layer coatings is due to the generation of cross-holes in the coating, which cannot be self-cured by the metaphosphate and silicate glass layer after long time oxidation at 1773K.","Wang, Kai-Tong;Cao, Li-Yun;Huang, Jian-Feng;Fei, Jie;Zhang, Bo-Ye",2013-03-31,Ceramics International,"Mullite,Carbon/carbon composites,C-AlPO4,Hydrothermal electrophoretic deposition",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.07.024,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.07.024
Influences of interface morphology and thermally grown oxide thickness on residual stress distribution in thermal barrier coating system,"Calculation of residual stress with finite element method is a basic work in failure mechanism investigation in thermal barrier coating (TBC) system because the residual stress is main driving force for crack nucleation and propagation. In this work, a complicated cosine curve with gradually increasing amplitude was used to simulate interface morphologies between layers so as to study the residual stress behavior during the cooling process in air plasma spraying TBC system by finite element method. The substrate, thermally grown oxide (TGO) and top coat (TC) are considered to be elastic and bond coat (BC) elastic-perfectly plastic. The material properties are all temperature dependent. The stress result comparison between models with and without substrate shows the effect of substrate on the residual stress distribution around layers interfaces should not be ignored as the substrate influences the value of normal residual stress as well as the stress distribution along undulating interfaces. Then the model with substrate was used to study the residual stress evolution along interfaces during cooling down from the temperature of 1000°C to room temperature. The influences of the thickness of TGO and the amplitude and wavelength of interface on the residual stress distributions near interfaces were considered. The results show that these influences are very complicated. Meanwhile, it's found that the hybrid roughness parameter containing information for height and spacing is more suitable to describe the interface complicacy. The results facilitate understanding the failure mechanism relevant to interface morphology and TGO thickness.","Yu, Q.M.;Zhou, H.L.;Wang, L.B.",2016-05-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,Stress,Interface morphology,Roughness",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.02.049,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.02.049

The structural, morphology, hardness and anti-corrosion properties of the NiW/TiNY2O3 coating have been evaluated by SEM, EDS, TEM, XRD and EIS methods. Results indicated that the samples have uniform and compact nodular structure without defects. It demonstrated that the TiN and Y2O3 nanoparticles had been uniformly distributed in the composites. The incorporation of TiN and Y2O3 in NiW matrix could improve the hardness and anti-corrosion properties. The crystallite size was in the diameter of 13–16 nm. The electrochemical results illustrated that 6-8 Adm−2 and 30 min were beneficial to the improvement of anti-corrosion behaviors of the produced composite coating. After immersed 168 h in 3.5 wt% NaCl aqueous solution, the coating prepared at 30 min and 2 A dm−2 owns better anti-corrosion properties.

"Preparation of novel porous calcium silicate scaffold loaded by celecoxib drug using freeze drying technique: Fabrication, characterization and simulation","In the current investigation, the microarchitecture of bio-nanocomposite scaffold, which is fabricated by natural synthetic diopside and composed of magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs), is considered. The MNPs are tested with various weight fractions (0, 5, 10, and 15 wt%) and are manufactured by the freeze-drying technique using sodium alginate as base matrix for the first time. Due to the limitation of the mechanical properties of calcium phosphates (CaPs) and bioactive glasses (BG), clinical usage of calcium silicate ceramics (CSC) are greatly affected. Therefore, CSCs are produced with the incorporation of metal oxides into the base binary xCaO-ySiO2, as well as the substitution of calcium ions. Furthermore, mechanical and biological properties of CSCs are enhanced, which are a result of the ability to give out bioactive ions and their distinct compositions. After that, the porous bio-nanocomposite scaffolds are investigated for biological and mechanical properties corresponding to hardness versus elastic modulus, apatite formation versus biodegradation rate, wetting properties versus roughness and electrical conductivity of the sample. Then, the composition, microstructure, and physical characteristics are also examined using different techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) which is equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The obtained outcomes show that addition of diopside bioceramic enhances the mechanical and physical properties of the samples. It is shown that the prepared porous bio-nanocomposite scaffolds, containing 10 wt% MNPs, represents a better agreement in serving as a bone graft for the cancer disease treatment and hyperthermia term.

Electromagnetic parameters and microwave absorption properties of the prepared ceramic coatings were investigated in the frequency range from 8.2 to 12.4GHz (X-band). It was found that both the real part and imaginary part of dielectric constant decreases with increasing Al2O3 content in the whole measured frequency region. Dielectric properties are closely related to the relaxation polarization and interfacial polarization and electric conductivity. Furthermore, by combination of the frequency selective surfaces (FSS) and prepared coatings, a double absorption band of the reflection loss spectra had been observed in X-band. The optimized reflection loss values exceeding −10dB can be obtained in the frequency range of X-band when the coating thickness is only 1.8mm, and the reflection loss is insensitive to incident angle from 0° to 45° for both transverse electromagnetic (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarizations.","Yang, Zhaoning;Luo, Fa;Hu, Yang;Zhu, Dongmei;Zhou, Wancheng",2016-05-15,Ceramics International,"C.

Erosion resistance and toughening mechanism of AlBO and BNw whiskers modified thermal barrier coatings,"In order to improve the erosion resistance and toughness of thermal barrier coatings, YSZ coatings, 20 vol%-AlBOw whisker modified YSZ coatings and 20 vol%-BNw whisker modified YSZ coatings were prepared by plasma spraying. The cross-section structure, morphology, composition and phase composition of coatings and powders were analyzed by SEM, EDS and XRD. The erosion resistance of three coatings was tested by self-made erosion tester. The crack growth resistance of coatings was tested and calculated by Vickers hardness tester. The results show that the density of the coating is improved by adding AlBOw and BNw. The whisker inhibits the crack propagation through the mechanisms of crack deflection, whisker pull-out and whisker bridging. The addition of whisker improves the erosion resistance of YSZ coating by 8.17% and 13.94%, which can effectively improve the service life of thermal barrier coating.","Haoliang, Tian;Changliang, Wang;Mengqiu, Guo;Junguo, Gao;Yongjing, Cui;Fuyuan, Wang;Erbao, Liu;Guo, Jin",2020-03-31,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,Whisker modification,Erosion resistance,Fracture toughness",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.186,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.186
Low thermal conductivity Y2Ti2O7 as a candidate material for thermal/environmental barrier coatings,"Ceramic matrix composites of yttrium titanate (Y2Ti2O7) with nickel (Ni) or silicon carbide (SiC) were synthesized to investigate their potential as candidate materials for thermal/environmental barrier coatings. The composites were sintered by hot-pressing at 25MPa. The mechanical properties of the composites including bulk density, Vickers hardness, and fracture toughness were evaluated. The measurements indicated that the incorporation of Ni or SiC has a positive effect in terms of enhancing the fracture toughness of the composites. Microstructural observations revealed that Y2Ti2O7/Ni is an inter/intra nanocomposite, while Y2Ti2O7/SiC has characteristics of a network microstructure composite. In addition, X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses confirmed Y2Ti2O7 was chemically stable against Ni, but reacted with SiC to form silicates during the sintering process. The mechanisms for these reactions are also proposed.","Nguyen, Son Thanh;Nakayama, Tadachika;Suematsu, Hisayuki;Suzuki, Tsuneo;Takeda, Masatoshi;Niihara, Koichi",2016-07-31,Ceramics International,"B.

Effects of inclination angle applied to a polyethylene terephalate substrate before the coating of Al-doped ZnO on film quality and mechanical and optical properties,"A flat plate in the deposition stage is designed to be tilted flexibly with an angle such that an inclination angle is formed between the ion beam and the direction normal to a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate. Five kinds of PET/aluminum-doped zinc oxide specimen, with 0°, 15°, 30°, 45°, and 60° inclination angles, respectively, were prepared to examine the effect of inclination angle on the mechanical, electrical, and optical properties and morphology of coating films. Using the peaks of the ZnO (002) and ZnO (103) planes in X-ray diffraction analyses, the relative intensity ratios for these two crystallines are defined and used to evaluate the parameters of composite grain size ((g) Composite ) and residual stress ((σ) Composite ). The experimental results indicate that (σ) Composite increases but (g) Composite mostly decreases with increasing inclination angle. A nearly linear relationship is found between (g) Composite and the d-spacing parameter ((d) Composite ). They both decrease with increasing inclination angle. The intensities of ZnO (002) and ZnO (103) planes significantly influence the mean transmittance, absorption, and reflection in the wavelength range of 801–2500nm (near-infrared). An increase in the relative peak intensity of ZnO (002) increases the mean transmittance and thus lowers the mean absorption and reflectance. The average transmittance decreases and the average reflection increases in the wavelength range of 300–2500nm with increasing inclination angle. Increasing the composite grain size decreases the average reflection. The ZnO film thickness is proportional to the mean surface roughness of the film.","Li, Tse-Chang;Chung, Chung-Jen;Han, Chang-Fu;Lin, Jen-Fin",2014-06-30,Ceramics International,"Al-doped film,Inclination angle,Mechanical and optical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.12.026,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.12.026
Light assisted room-temperature NO2 sensors with enhanced performance based on black SnO1-α@ZnO1-β@SnO2-γ nanocomposite coatings deposited by solution precursor plasma spray,"The development of room-temperature gas sensors with high performance for nitrogen dioxide gases is of great importance and appealing. Our previous works show that visible light illumination is an effective method to replace heating. In this paper, solution precursor plasma spray (SPPS) process is used to prepare black SnO1-α@ZnO1-β@SnO2-γ sensitive coatings. Stoichiometric ZnO, SnO2 and SnO are in white color. The introduced highly concentrated donor defects provided by SPPS process make them turn to black. The light absorption range of the black coatings was extended from ultraviolet area to yellow light region. Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to characterize the chemical compositions and oxidation states of SPPS coatings. Donor defects formed deep donor levels between the valence band and conduction band, which can be excited under visible light illumination. FE-SEM and HRTEM images exhibited a highly porous nanostructure, and n-n heterojunctions were formed between SnO1-α, ZnO1-β and SnO2-γ. The SPPS coatings exhibited an obvious response towards 1.0ppm NO2 gas under visible light illumination at room temperature. The enhanced sensing performance was mainly attributed to the presence of donor defects and homogenous heterojunctions.","Geng, Xin;Zhang, Chao;Luo, Yifan;Liao, Hanlin;Debliquy, Marc",2017-06-01,Ceramics International,"Solution precursor plasma spray,Homo-heterojunction,Donor defects,Gas sensors",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.01.136,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.01.136
Preparation and sintering of Ni-coated Si3N4 composite powders,"Ni-coated Si3N4 composite powders were prepared successfully via electroless plating by using sodium hypophosphate (NaH2PO2) as reducing agent. The Ni coating layers contained 12wt.% phosphor and were dominantly amorphous with a thickness of 20–60nm. The sintering properties of Ni–Si3N4 composite were improved by adding Mo2C into Si3N4 powders, in which Mo2C formed liquid to improve the α–β transformation of Si3N4, and Mo2C converted into MoSi2 after sintering. The composite powders were densified by hot-pressing at 1600°C.

Studies on corrosion resistance of thick Ti/TiN multilayer coatings under solid NaCl–H2O–O2 at 450 oC,"Thick Ti/TiN multilayer coatings with different thicknesses of Ti sublayers were prepared on Ti–6Al–4V titanium alloy by arc ion plating technology. The corrosion resistance of coatings was investigated under solid NaCl, water vapor and oxygen at 450 oC. The results demonstrate that the as-prepared Ti/TiN multilayer coatings were consisted of Ti, Ti2N and TiN phases. The crystalline grains of TiN layers exhibited columnar growth, while Ti sublayers with equiaxed grains interrupted the continuity of columnar grains of TiN layers in Ti/TiN multilayer coatings. With the increasing in Ti layer thickness, more and larger macroparticles were embedded into the multilayer coatings. Ti/TiN multilayer coating with thinner Ti sublayer maintained integrity except for the formation of a continuous thin corrosion scale after corrosion tests and no obvious internal oxidation occurred, presenting favorable corrosion resistance. In contrast, locally severe internal oxidation occurred to Ti/TiN multilayer coatings with thicker Ti layer, deteriorating the corrosion resistance of multilayer coatings. Oxygen inwardly diffused from ambient environment to sublayers along the pinholes or columnar structure penetrating through TiN layer. This resulted in internal oxidation accompanied with volume expansion, then bending and cracking of sublayers, and finally promoting localized corrosion of multilayer coatings with thicker Ti sublayer. Besides, the existence of large macroparticles facilitated this localized internal oxidation. Internal oxide also occurred at the edge of TiN single layer coating, which was essentially detrimental for coating protection with prolonged exposure.","Zhang, Mingming;Niu, Yunsong;Xin, Li;Su, Jianxiu;Li, Yongfeng;Wu, Tingting;Zhao, Hongyuan;Zhang, Yaqi;Xie, Wenlong;Zhu, Shenglong;Wang, Fuhui",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"Titanium alloy,Ti/TiN multilayer Coating,High temperature corrosion,Internal oxidation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.267,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.267
Microhardness and wear resistance of Al2O3-TiB2-TiC ceramic coatings on carbon steel fabricated by laser cladding,"Al2O3-TiB2-TiC ceramic coatings with high microhardness and wear resistance were fabricated on the surfaces of carbon steel substrates by laser cladding using different coating formulations. The microstructures of these ceramic coatings with the different coating formulations were investigated using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive spectrometer. The wear resistance and wear mechanism were analyzed using Vickers microhardness and sliding wear tests. The results showed that when the amount of independent Al2O3 was increased to 30%, the ceramic coatings had a favorable surface formation quality and strong metallurgical bond with the steel matrix. The cladding layer was uniformly and densely organized. The black massive Al2O3, white granular TiB2, and TiC distributed on the Fe substrate significantly increased the microhardness and wear resistance. The laser cladding ceramic coating had many hard strengthening phases, and thus resisted the extrusion of rigid particles in frictional contact parts. Therefore, the wear process ended with a “cutting-off” loss mechanism.","Li, Zhaoliang;Wei, Mumeng;Xiao, Kui;Bai, Ziheng;Xue, Wei;Dong, Chaofang;Wei, Dan;Li, Xiaogang",2019-01-31,Ceramics International,"Ceramic coating,Microhardness,Wear resistance,Wear mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.140,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.140
"A comparative study of surface morphology, mechanical and tribological properties of DLC films deposited on Cr and Ni nanolayers","Applying metallic interlayer between diamond-like carbon (DLC) and substrate is a promising method to improve the adhesion and efficiency of DLC films. Understanding how the interlayer parameters affect the properties of DLC coatings leads to production of long-time excellent performance of them. In this study, DLC films deposited by PECVD and 10, 20 and 40 nm layers of Ni and Cr were sputtered on silicon substrates to use as the adhesion layers. The role of chemical structure and physical parameters (surface roughness) of interlayers on the final properties of DLC films were investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), nanoscratch and nanoindentation techniques. It was found that a lower surface roughness with a sharp and homogenous distribution of particles sizes (height) results in formation of a smooth DLC film with lower friction coefficient, more stress reduction and better adhesion strength. It was discussed that the chemical structure of the interlayer was important in the solubility and diffusion of carbon atoms and consequently in instability of sp3 and sp2 bonding. Results demonstrated that 40 nm Cr interlayer, not only improved the adhesion of the DLC films but also generated the lowest friction coefficient, better wear resistance and the highest hardness (27 GPa).","Shahsavari, Fatemeh;Ehteshamzadeh, Maryam;Amin, Mohamad Hassan;Barlow, Anders J.",2020-03-31,Ceramics International,"Diamond-like carbon,Surface roughness,Atomic force microscopy,Raman spectroscopy,Nanoindentation test,Nanoscratch test",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.251,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.251
One-step dip-coating of uniform γ-Al2O3 layers on cordierite honeycombs and its environmental applications,"Cordierite honeycomb with high loading and uniform coating of γ-Al2O3 was prepared by a facile one-step dip coating strategy. The γ-Al2O3 obtained loading, which was as high as 30%, could be calculated according to the different weight of bare and washcoated cordierite honeycomb. SEM micrographs showed that coarser surface and round channels were formed, demonstrating complete coverage of a γ-Al2O3 layer on cordierite. The coating thickness was 30µm, corresponding very well to the theoretical value, indicating a homogeneous coating of γ-Al2O3. Besides, no crack was observed on the surface or the corner of the channel wall. The washcoat exhibited excellent adherence with no significant weight loss after 3h ultrasonic treatment, attributing to the “nail-like” strong interaction between the support and the washcoat. The derived PdCl2-CuCl2 monolith catalyst showed excellent activity and stability for CO oxidation at room temperature in microreactor. The catalyst was also effective in pilot-scale test using the diesel exhaust as feed gas, presenting a great application prospect.","Yuan, Jing;Zhao, Kunfeng;Cai, Ting;Gao, Zhenyuan;Yang, Ling;He, Dannong",2016-10-31,Ceramics International,"Cordierite honeycomb,Washcoating,High loading,Uniform coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.003
Effects of HfC nanowire amount on the microstructure and ablation resistance of CVD-HfC coating,"To improve the ablation resistance of HfC coating for carbon/carbon (C/C) composites, various fractions of HfC nanowires were incorporated into the HfC coating by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Effects of HfC nanowire amount on the microstructure and ablation resistance of the CVD-HfC coating were investigated. Results indicated that the HfC nanowire layer became thicker and denser with the deposition time extending. HfC nanowires could inhibit the formation of cracks and interlaminar gaps in the HfC coating. With the increase of HfC nanowire amount, the HfC coating became thicker, while its porosity and roughness firstly decreased and then increased. Ablation tests indicated that the incorporation of HfC nanowires could effectively improve the ablation resistance of the HfC coating, which could be ascribed to the decreasing surface temperature of the coated samples and the effective alleviation of cracking and delamination of the coating during ablation. The HfC coating with HfC nanowires deposited for 1 h exhibited better ablation resistance owing to its compact microstructure, and its mass and linear ablation rates were only 0.41 mg/s and − 1.53 µm/s after ablation for 120 s.","Ren, Jincui;Zhang, Yulei;Zhang, Jian;Fu, Yanqin;Tian, Song",2018-07-31,Ceramics International,"HfC nanowires,HfC coating,Carbon/carbon composites,CVD,Ablation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.183,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.183
Increase of Voc using heterojunctions of BaTiO3 without sensitization,"In this work, we explored the properties of Barium Titanate (BaTiO3) for application in photoanodes. Unlike other works that used heterojunction, we developed a solar cell by combining Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) and BaTiO3 without sensitization. The increase of Voc in the cell with heterojunction may be explained with TiO2 acted as a blocking layer and as a charge acceptor from BaTiO3, improving the photovoltaic response of the cells, even without dye. For comparison, we developed a Dye-Sensitized Solar Cell (DSSC) by using Barium Titanate (BaTiO3) photoanodes with dye (N-3). The compounds used in the cells has been synthesized with: the microwave-assisted hydrothermal method for BaTiO3 and the Pechini method for TiO2. We use the techniques spin coating for TiO2 layer deposition and doctor blade for BaTiO3 layer. Typical features of a tetragonal structure were revealed by Raman and XAS spectroscopy, suggesting a non-centrosymmetric Ti atom in the TiO₆ octahedron. This result may generate localized states into the band gap. UV–vis absorption and photoluminescence indicate low recombination of the electron-hole pair. That may contribute to the photovoltaic behavior if associated with heterojunctions.","Lilge, Tatiane Strelow;Ramires das Neves Stigger, Ananda;Fernandes, Cristian Dias;Gularte, Luciano Timm;Raubach, Cristiane Wienke;da Silva Cava, Sérgio;Gomes Jardim, Pedro Lovato;Giroldo Valerio, Mário Ernesto;Moreira, Mario Lucio",2020-03-31,Ceramics International,"DSSC,Blocking layer,Barium titanate,Hydrothermal synthesis",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.227,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.227
Characterization and biostability of HA/Ti6Al4V ACL anchor prepared by simple heat-treatment,"Here, we report a simple heat-treatment process to prepare hydroxyapatite (HA)-coated Ti6Al4V anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) anchor that has good hard tissue compatibility and biostability. Heat treatment was carried out for 1.5h at temperature range of 700–900°C. Morphological characterization showed rougher surface and larger pore spaces as the heat treatment temperature was increased. The Ti6Al4V heat-treated at 800°C had the highest diffused titanium phosphide formation, thus making it high in biocompatibility. For in vivo test, the most bone integration ability was obtained for heat-treatment at 800 and 900°C. Furthermore, the HA/Ti6Al4V ACL anchor heat-treated at 800°C had the highest amount of new bone formation. The present results suggest that an implant with complex shape like an ACL anchor could be prepared and used with an easy and low-cost technique by simple heat treatment surface modification method after dip-coating with HA.","Park, Chan-Hee;Jung, Min Young;Tijing, Leonard D.;Lee, Hae Beom;Kim, Nam Soo;Kim, Cheol Sang",2012-09-30,Ceramics International,"B.

Microstructure and oxidation behaviors at 800°C and 1250°C of MoSi2/ReSi2/NbSi2 compound coating prepared by electrodeposition and then pack cementation,"MoRe duplex film has been electrodeposited from aqueous solution innovatively and then applied to fabricate protective silicide coating for the NbTiSi based alloy successively. The XRD, SEM and EDS results indicated the formation of MoSi2/ReSi2/NbSi2 compound coating after halide reactivated pack cementation (HAPC) treatment. Pesting oxidation of MoSi2 layer was suppressed and the NbTiSi based alloy was effectively protected at 800 °C with a mass gain of 0.48 mg cm−2 after oxidation for 100 h. At 1250 °C, continuous mass gain was observed with a mass gain of 2.6 mg cm−2 after exposure of 10 h. The synergistic combination of MoSi2 and NbSi2 layer enabled admirable protection of the substrate, in which MoSi2 layer worked as the major anti-oxidation coating and the NbSi2 layer could be a reservoir for Si. The contrast experiments indicate that ReSi2 layer could improve the integrity and adherence of MoSi2 layer, reduce the outward diffusion of alloying elements and oxidation of NbSi2 layer, and then improve oxidation resistance of the compound coating ultimately.","Yue, Gao;Guo, Xiping;Qiao, Yanqiang",2019-06-15,Ceramics International,"Electrodeposition,Silicide coating,Intermetallic,Oxidation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.050,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.050
Effects of colouration mechanism and stability of CoAl2O4 ceramic pigments sintered on substrates,"CoAl2O4 ceramic pigments produced by common methods have low chroma values, which limit their application in ceramic glazing, enamel glazing, and ceramic product printing. The colour stability of the ceramic pigments and changes upon high-temperature sintering are important factors, especially in 3D printing. In this study, CoAl2O4 ceramic pigments were synthesized using a co-precipitation method and both the colouration mechanism and stability of CoAl2O4 ceramic pigments were investigated. The Co content, Co ion valence, and coordination number were found to be important factors affecting the CoAl2O4 ceramic pigments. When the Co content was excessively high, either Co3+was produced or Co2+ entered the octahedron spaces of the spinel structure. The coordination field of the Co ions was consequently altered and the colour transitioned from blue to green. After sintering on substrates at 1300°C, the brightness and chroma of obtained CoAl2O4 coatings were superior to those of the pigment powders prior to sintering, and the colour of CoAl2O4 with a relatively high Co/Al ratio changed from green to blue. The latter pigment may have formed a partially inverse spinel structure upon sintering at a high temperature. The probability of Co2+ entering the octahedron spaces increased; concomitantly, the number of Co2+ in the tetrahedron spaces decreased, resulting in an increase in the coordination number of Co. In addition, Co3+ in the ceramic pigments was transformed into Co2+ by deoxidation reactions during the coating sintering process, thereby increasing the chroma of blue CoAl2O4 pigments.","Tang, Yufei;Wu, Cong;Song, Yuan;Zheng, Yuanlin;Zhao, Kang",2018-01-31,Ceramics International,"Co-precipitation,CoAl2O4 pigments,Chroma,Colouration mechanism,Colour stability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.038,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.038
Cathode plasma electrolytic deposition of Al2O3 coatings doped with SiC particles,"Semiconductor particles doped Al2O3 coatings were prepared by cathode plasma electrolytic deposition in Al(NO3)3 electrolyte dispersed with SiC micro- and nano-particles (average particle sizes of 0.5–1.7 µm and 40 nm respectively). The effects of the concentrations and particle sizes of the SiC on the microstructures and tribological performances of the composite coatings were studied. In comparison with the case of dispersing with SiC microparticles, the dispersion of SiC nanoparticles in the coatings was more uniform. When the concentration of SiC nanoparticles was 5 g/L, the surface roughness of the composite coating was reduced by 63%, compared with that of the unmodified coating. Friction results demonstrated that the addition of 5 g/L SiC nanoparticles reduced the friction coefficient from 0.60 to 0.38 and decreased the wear volume under dry friction. The current density and bath voltage were measured to analyze the effects of SiC particles on the deposition process. The results showed that the SiC particles could alter the electrical behavior of the coatings during the deposition process, weaken the bombardment of the plasma, and improve the structures of the coatings.","Liu, Chenxu;Zhang, Shuguang;Ji, Ruonan;Wang, Peng;Zhang, Jin;Tian, Yu;Meng, Yonggang;He, Yedong",2019-03-31,Ceramics International,"Al2O3 coatings,SiC particles,Cathode plasma electrolytic deposition,Surface roughness",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.167,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.167
On the nature of phases in Al2O3 and Al2O3–SiC thermal spray coatings,"Nature of alumina phases in thermal sprayed Al2O3 and nanocomposite Al2O3–SiC coatings is investigated. The coatings were prepared using high velocity oxy fuel spraying (HVOF) and air plasma spraying (APS) techniques on mild steel substrates either with Ni5Al or Ni20Cr bond layer. Coating top layer thickness was 250μm and 1mm. The amount of SiC was varied from 2 to 8mass%. Flat and roller geometries were used for substrates. While coatings on flat specimens were used for low temperature heat treatments (100 and 700°C); peels (free forms) of roller specimens were used for high temperature (≥1000°C) heat treatments. X-ray diffraction technique was used for phase characterisation. The coatings showed the presence of varied amounts of well-known alumina phases and the relatively new U phase. It was observed that depending upon the thermal energy of the spray process even smaller particles <20μm, gave rise to (contrary to the earlier hypothesis) unmelted α-seeds (nuclei) and α-alumina nucleated in preference to γ-alumina. Presence of SiC (mostly inside alumina grains) in alumina nanocomposite coatings increased the amount of α-phase formation in the coatings. The transformation temperatures, of alumina polymorphs, of the thermally sprayed alumina coatings, are found to be in accordance with the dehydration of boehmite. The discrepancies (higher transformation temperatures) in the earlier literature on alumina sprayed coatings were due to the presence of impurities in the coating. SiC increased the transformation of metastable alumina polymorphs to stable α-phase by 200°C. The alumina phases in HVOF Al2O3–SiC coatings undergo γ→δ→θ→α phase transformations on heating (1000–1400°C) as observed during dehydration of boehmite. However, the transformation temperatures of metastable alumina phases in SiC containing nanocomposite coatings were 100–200°C higher than the pure alumina coatings.","Uma Devi, M",2004-12-31,Ceramics International,"B.

Rutile-perovskite multi-phase composite by mechano-chemical method together with calcination: Preparation and application in coatings and ceramic glaze,"In this article, rutile-perovskite multi-phase composite was produced using mechano-chemical method followed by calcination with metatitanic acid and GCC as raw materials. The relative parameters in mechano-chemical method, such as slurry concentration, grinding time and ball to powder ratio, and the relative parameters in calcination, namely calcination temperature and calcination time, were researched systematically in order to get the optimum value. The structure and morphology of the final product were characterized and the reaction mechanism was investigated. The final product, namely the rutile-perovskite multi-phase composite, has excellent pigment properties comparable to titanium white. It also has excellent performances in coatings and ceramic glaze.

After densified via PIP process, microstructure, three-point bending strength and thermal conductivity of the composite were investigated. The results showed that, SiC particles filled the gaps between the SiC fiber bundles efficiently, and thermal conductivity of the composites fabricated through PIP process assisted by EPD was 2.3 times that of the composites fabricated via PIP only. The bending strength of the EPD-composites was 647.08 ± 69.53 MPa, which decreased to 2/3 of that of the composites manufactured only by PIP, owing to the reduction of fiber volume fraction and the damages to the interface coatings and fibers under the action of the electric field.","Li, Mingyuan;Yang, Dexuan;Wang, Honglei;Zhou, Xingui",2019-06-15,Ceramics International,"Composites,Thermal conductivity,SiC,Electrophoretic deposition",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.041,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.041
"Preparation and characterization of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 thin films via direct heating selenium-ion containing precursors","Polycrystalline Cu(In,Ga)Se2 thin films were synthesized as absorber layers in solar cells using a simple synthetic route. In this synthesis, selenium ion-containing precursors were heated in a reducing atmosphere to yield CIGS films instead of conventional heating in a selenium-containing atmosphere. Selenium ions were incorporated into the precursor films to form chalcopyrite-type CIGS films at comparatively low temperature (350°C). As the heating temperature increased, the crystallinity and density of the formed CIGS films improved. The open circuit voltage (V oc), short circuit current density (J sc), fill factor (FF) and conversion efficiency (η) of the prepared solar cells also substantially increased with the heating temperature. CIGS solar cells with absorber layers that had been heated at 550°C exhibited a conversion efficiency of 8.27%. The corresponding values of V oc, J sc, and FF were obtained as 0.452V, 32.9mA/cm2 and 55.5% respectively. The diode parameters were reduced and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the CIGS solar cells was improved by increasing the heating temperature. The photoluminescence peaks that were associated with the donor–acceptor pairs became weaker as the heating temperature increased. The suppression of electron–hole recombination led to improve the photovoltaic properties of the solar cells. This study demonstrates that directly heating selenium ion-containing precursors is an effective way to prepare highly efficient CIGS absorber layers for solar cells applications.","Ma, Jeng-Shin;Yang, Che-Yuan;Sung, Jen-Cheng;Som, Sudipta;Lu, Chung-Hsin",2015-11-30,Ceramics International,"CIGS,Spin-coating process,Thin film,Solar cell",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.05.042,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.05.042
Leakage-current characteristics of sol–gel-derived Ba1-xSrxTiO3 (BST) thin films,"Thin films of Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3 (BST) were fabricated on RuO2/Ru/SiO2/Si substrates by spin coating multicomponent sol prepared using metal alkoxides. To analyze the surface effect of the dielectric film on the leakage current characteristics required for DRAM applications, post-annealing was carried out under O2 or Ar atmosphere. Based on AES and RBS data, we have concluded that doubly ionized oxygen vacancies are readily generated on the outermost surface of the BST thin film post-annealed under Ar atmosphere. The leakage current densities of the BST thin film post-annealed with O2 and with Ar gases are approximately 1×10−6 A/cm2 and 4.6×10−6 A/cm2 at 1V, respectively. This observation was interpreted in terms of (i) the increase in the tunneling current caused by the decrease in the depletion width at the surface region under Ar atmosphere and (ii) the effect from the bottom electrode under oxidative environment.","Jang, Soo-Ik;Jang, Hyun M.",2000-05-01,Ceramics International,"Leakage current,Sol–gel derived,Ba1-xSrxTiO3,Thin films",10.1016/S0272-8842(99)00073-5,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0272-8842(99)00073-5
Strongly adherent Al2O3 coating on SS 316L: Optimization of plasma spray parameters and investigation of unique wear resistance behaviour under air and nitrogen environment,"Plasma spray deposition of Al2O3 is a well-established technique for thick ceramic coatings on various substrates to shield them from corrosion and wear. Owing to its high hardness, aluminum oxide is known to protect stainless steel substrates from wear. However, the plasma process requires optimization for desired coating thickness and adhesion strength. It is also necessary to understand the sensitivity of friction and wear resistance of the deposited coating on exposed environment for evaluation of service life. The study offers comprehensive investigation on plasma process parameters for the development of strongly adherent aluminium oxide coatings on SS 316L substrate. Impact of environment like dry air and dry nitrogen on tribological properties of the coatings was also investigated. Dense adherent coatings of alumina could be deposited on SS 316L at a plasma power of 20 kW with an intermediate bond coat of NiCrAlY to enhance the adhesion properties. The effects of stand-off distance and bond coat thickness on adhesion strength were additionally examined. Further, the coatings were characterised for phase composition, microstructure, microhardness and wear resistance potential. Reciprocating wear tests of the coatings were carried out using ball on disc reciprocating tribometer at different loading conditions (5, 10 and 15 N) at constant (5 Hz) sliding frequency. Unlike the coefficient of friction (COF), wear volume was found to increase with an increase in normal load. These adherent coatings revealed promising properties for the applications where the tribological failure of SS 316L in dry air or dry nitrogen environment is to be controlled.","Misra, Vandana Chaturvedi;Chakravarthy, Y.;Khare, Neelima;Singh, K.;Ghorui, S.",2020-05-31,Ceramics International,"Thermal plasma,Ceramic coating,Coating adhesion,Metastable phase,Microstructure,Tribology",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.099,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.099
Thermal cycling resistance of ZrB2‒SiC coatings with MgO additive on SiC coated graphite,"To improve the thermal cycling resistance of ZrB2–SiC/SiC dual layer coating, MgO was added into the pack powders used to prepare ZrB2–SiC outer coating by pack cementation. The composition, microstructure and thermal cycling resistance of these coatings were studied. The results show that as-received coatings were mainly composed of SiC, ZrB2 and Si. ZrB2–SiC outer coating contained 5wt%, 7wt%, 9wt% MgO additive showed better thermal cycling resistance with 97.6%, 98.8% and 96.5% weight retention after 15 thermal shock cycles between 1500°C and room temperature.","Zhou, Changling;Wang, Peng;Chen, Zhiwei;Wei, Chuncheng;Han, Wenbo",2018-02-01,Ceramics International,"ZrB2–SiC,Coating,Oxidation,Thermal cycling resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.232,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.232

CMAS corrosion and thermal cycle of Al-modified PS-PVD environmental barrier coating,"Environmental barrier coatings (EBCs) with a tri-layer structure consisting of silicon, mulltite and Yb2SiO5 were deposited by plasma spray-physical vapor deposition (PS-PVD) on SiC/SiC ceramic matrix composite (CMC). To improve the calcium-aluminum-magnesium-silicates (CMAS) corrosion resistance of EBCs, a novel method called “Al-modification of EBCs surface” was proposed, wherein an Al film was first deposited on surface of Yb2SiO5 top coating by magnetron sputtering, and afterwards the vacuum heat treatment was carried out on the Al-deposited EBCs samples. The thermal cycle performance of both as-sprayed and Al-modified EBCs was characterized from 1300 °C to the temperature of environmental water. Moreover, the CMAS corrosion property of both types of EBCs at 1300 °C has been compared with each other. And the corrosion mechanism between CMAS and Al-modified EBCs has been investigated.

Introducing natural hydroxyapatite-diopside (NHA-Di) nano-bioceramic coating,"In the presented study, the deposition of nanostructured NHA-Di (natural hydroxyapatite-diopside) composite coatings on the surface of Ti-6Al-4V implants is studied. The effect of electrophoretic deposition (EPD) voltage, Di content and process temperature on the surface roughness is also investigated. The powders are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF). The atomic force microscopy (AFM) is also used to study the surface topography. According to SEM observations, there are hard agglomerates in the NHA-Di composite powders at low percentage of Di; however they are broken down by increasing the amount of Di percentage. Images which were obtained from the 2D AFM analysis of the NHA-Di coating after its deposition on Ti alloy specimen surface, indicated that the “Roughen” diagram fluctuates between the range of −0.03 and 0.01μm under the conditions that the Di content reaches 30wt%. A specific load is applied during the adhesion test which resulted in NHA-30wt% Di coating maintain its impeccability while the NHA-0wt% Di coating samples were damaged.A graph is also developed based on the Hertz stress which proved to be challenging in terms of chemical stability based on its surface roughness.","Khandan, Amirsalar;Abdellahi, Majid;Barenji, Reza Vatankhah;Ozada, Neriman;Karamian, Ebrahim",2015-11-30,Ceramics International,"NHA-Di ceramic,Surface,Roughness,Coating,Ti-6Al-4V",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.06.065,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.06.065
Dielectric properties of BN modified carbon fibers by dip-coating,"Continuous and uniform boron nitride (BN) coatings were synthesized on carbon fibers by dip-coating and their microstructure, chemical composition and dielectric properties were investigated. Results show that the as-prepared coatings are composed of phase mixture of h-BN and amorphous t-BN. The oxidation property of the BN modified carbon fibers is improved with higher initial and final oxidation temperatures. Both the real (ε′) and imaginary part (ε″) of permittivity of the BN modified carbon fibers decrease significantly compared with the pure carbon fibers. The decrease of ε′ can be mainly attributed to the absence of dielectric relaxation effect, while the decrease of ε″ can be ascribed to the large decrease in electrical conductivity. The decreasing permittivity leads to increase of microwave impedance which is beneficial for electromagnetic matching. With improved impedance match and still relatively high ε″, the BN modified carbon fibers exhibit a promising prospect as microwave absorbing materials.","Zhou, Wei;Xiao, Peng;Li, Yang;Zhou, Liang",2013-08-31,Ceramics International,"B.

The effect of electroless bath pH on the surface properties of one-dimensional Ni–P nanomaterials,"In this research, the one-dimensional Ni–P nanomaterials was formed on alumina substrate. The effect of electroless bath pH on the surface properties of one-dimensional Ni–P nanostructures was investigated. For evaluation of morphological properties and chemical composition of deposits, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, which coupled with energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS) were used. Two-step anodization for alumina substrate was selected as the best sample for producing the one-dimensional Ni–P nanomaterials. The electroless coating was carried out at different pH = 4.5, 5.5 and 6.5 values. The results showed that in all samples, due to the high Ni–P deposition rate, the Ni–P nanomaterials does not fill the entire channel path. By increasing the pH value, the one-dimensional nanomaterials were changed from nanowire to nanotube type. Also, by increasing the pH value, despite increasing the length of Ni–P nanomaterials, but the compactness of this material was reduced. So, the optimum pH value for producing the one-dimensional Ni–P materials was 4.5. On the other hand, by reducing the pH value, the crystallinity degree of Ni–P deposits was increased. The pH content trends along the nanomaterials length were indicated that the phosphorus content toward the bottom of channel was increased.","Nahavandi, Mohsen;Monirvaghefi, Seyyed Mahmoud",2020-02-01,Ceramics International,"Alumina,Electroless,Nanomaterial,Ni–P,One-dimension",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.169,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.169
Structure and properties of short fibre reinforced silica matrix composite foams,"Glass (GFC) and silica (SFC) fibre reinforced silica matrix composite foams with 84–90% porosity content have been developed through slurry-based processing, involving random dispersion of 10wt.% fibres with aspect ratios of >1000 in hydrophobized silica-based suspensions, and direct foaming for air entrapment. Fibre entanglement has not been found either in the suspensions or in the sintered composite foams. Microstructural and mercury porosimetry studies of the composite foams have shown a trimodal size distribution with small (4–8μm), medium (40–200μm), and large (∼1mm or more) pores. The pores appear spherical and interconnected, with the fibres embedded in cell-walls or struts. The dynamic Young's modulus of the silica-coated GFCs is found to be ∼3.5 and ∼5.2 times that of the coated and uncoated monolithic silica foams, respectively, confirming that both fibre-reinforcement and the presence of surface coating are beneficial for increase in stiffness of the composite foams.","Mishra, Sarika;Mitra, R.;Vijayakumar, M.",2009-12-31,Ceramics International,"A.

The relative densities were 99.3% and 98.1% for monolithic alumina and composite, respectively. CNT addition improved the fracture toughness of alumina by ~37%.

Effects of preheating temperature and cooling rate on two-step residual stress in thermal barrier coatings considering real roughness and porosity effect,"In this research, a finite element model was developed in order to simulate the two-step residual stress distribution of a thermal barrier coating system, considered to be used in diesel engine cylinder head, with a real roughness and real porosity. Two steps including the bond coat and the top coat deposition processes were taken into account. The real geometry of coating layers, including the roughness and the porosity, was also considered based on a scanning electron microscopy image. Then, effects of the convective heat transfer coefficient and initial substrate and substrate/bond coat preheating temperatures on the residual stress were studied. Obtained results illustrate that the residual stress, regarding the two steps of coating processes, are different, particularly in the substrate. Numerical results indicate that while the convective heat transfer coefficient in BC deposition had no striking effect, it was an influential factor in the residual stress distribution when TC was deposited. Moreover, preheating temperature for depositions of the bond coat layer and the top coat layer has a pivotal role in stress distribution of all layers. In addition, consideration of the porosity in the top coat layer causes remarkable decrease in axial stress distribution in substrate and much more local stress concentrations in TC layer compared to those of BC layer due to larger and more irregular pores.","Rezvani Rad, M.;Farrahi, G.H.;Azadi, M.;Ghodrati, M.",2014-12-31,Ceramics International,"B.

"Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs): Green preparation, characterization and their cytotoxicity effects","Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs; Fe3O4) were prepared by the covalent binding of starch onto the surface of magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles, by a “green” co–precipitation method. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) illustrated the regular spheres of Fe3O4 particles that were coated by starch molecules to be regular spheres with a mean diameter of about 40nm. Powder X–ray diffraction patterns (PXRD) indicated that the prepared samples were pure Fe3O4 with a spinel structure while the coating of starch did not result in a phase change. The starch coating onto the Fe3O4 nanoparticles was also demonstrated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra. Magnetic measurements revealed that the saturated magnetization of the starch–SPIONs reached 42.1emu/g, having nanoparticles with the characteristics of superparamagnetism, while a dose dependent toxicity with non–toxic effect of concentration below 62.5µg/mL was observed in the studies of in vitro cytotoxicity on neuro2A cells.","Darroudi, Majid;Hakimi, Mohammad;Goodarzi, Elham;Kazemi Oskuee, Reza",2014-11-30,Ceramics International,"Iron oxide,Nanoparticles,Neuro2A,Starch,Superparamagnetic",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.06.051,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.06.051
Effects of surface structure unit of 2D needled carbon fiber preform on the microstructure and ablation properties of C/C-ZrC-SiC composites,"To investigate the effects of different structure units on the ablation properties of C/C-ZrC-SiC composites produced from 2D needled carbon fiber preforms as reinforcements, non-woven layer, short-cut fiber web and the surface of laminated layers of the composites were ablated by oxyacetylene flame respectively. Results showed that the formation ability of surface protective layer and the fiber orientation were the key factors, determining ablation properties of different structure units. Short-cut fiber web presented the best ablation resistance due to the forming of compactly integrated ZrO2 self-protection coating because of its sufficient ceramic content. However, only scattered oxide particles formed on the ablated surface of non-woven layer, which resulted in serious erosion of carbon fibers and carbon matrices, leading to the poor ablation resistance. Compared with the non-woven layer perpendicular to the flame, the anti-ablation property was even worse when it paralleled to the flame.","Xie, Jing;Li, Kezhi;Sun, Guodong;Li, Hui;Su, Xinghua;Han, Yisong;Li, Tong",2019-06-15,Ceramics International,"Carbon/carbon composites,Ceramic-matrix composites,Ablation,Microstructure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.078,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.078
"Ion beam engineering of morphological, structural, optical and photocatalytic properties of Ag-TiO2-PVA nanocomposite thin film","Development of plasmonic nanocomposite coatings with tunable optical and photocatalytic properties is important for diverse technological applications. In this paper, we report modifications in the microstructural, optical and photocatalytic properties of Ag-TiO2-PVA nanocomposite thin film by 8 MeV Si3+ ion irradiation. Ag-TiO2-PVA nanocomposite thin films on silica glass were prepared by a combination of sol-gel method and spin coating. Ion irradiation induced morphological evolution of Ag-TiO2-PVA thin film was studied by atomic force microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy, which revealed interesting changes in the size distribution of nanostructures with increasing ion fluence. Ion irradiation of the Ag-TiO2-PVA thin film resulted in the emergence of SPR peak of Ag nanoparticles at 456 nm, which shifted to 446 nm along with enhancement in intensity as the ion fluence was increased. Significant enhancement in the photocatalytic efficiency of Ag-TiO2-PVA nanocomposite thin film for degradation of methylene blue was observed upon ion irradiation at 1 × 1013 ions/cm2.

Hydroxyapatite-carboxymethyl cellulose-graphene composite coating development on AZ31 magnesium alloy: Corrosion behavior and mechanical properties,"In this study, hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings containing carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and graphene (Gr) were developed on AZ31 magnesium alloy through two-step electrophoretic deposition method. The morphology and chemical bonding of coatings were characterized and also the phase identification was done using scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction, respectively. Moreover, the corrosion behavior of the applied coatings was compared with the bare AZ31 Mg alloy substrate in the simulated body fluid by the means of potentiodynamic polarization test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Obtained results revealed that the novel HA-CMC-Gr coating possesses the highest corrosion resistance compared to the HA, HA-CMC, and HA-Gr coatings due to its uniform and compact structure. To investigate the mechanical properties and to elucidate the effect of CMC on the adhesion of coating-alloy interface, pull-off test was employed, where results demonstrated that the addition of CMC increases the adhesion force from 1.06 MPa to 1.62 MPa. Besides, the modulus of elasticity and the hardness of HA and HA-Gr composite coatings were compared by applying nanoindentation test. Interestingly, it is detected that the presence of Gr has considerably increased the elastic modulus of the coating by approximately 30% in comparison to the pure HA coating.","Ahangari, M.;Johar, M.H.;Saremi, M.",2020-09-19,Ceramics International,"Hydroxyapatite,Graphene,Carboxymethyl cellulose,Composite coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.197,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.197
Laser sintered ceramic coatings of PZT nanoparticles deposited by Inkjet Printing on metallic and ceramic substrates,"Lead zirconate titanate (PZT) Pb(ZrxTi1-x)O3 is one of the most studied perovskite type ferroelectric materials due to its excellent dielectric, piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties.

Enhanced response of the photoactive gas sensor on formaldehyde using porous SnO2@TiO2 heterostructure driven by gas-flow thermal evaporation and atomic layer deposition,"Nanoporous SnO2@TiO2 heterostructure was synthesized by a facile two-step dry process, modified thermal evaporation followed by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The introduction of inert gas, Ar, with a pressure of 0.2 Torr during thermal evaporation of SnO, enabled the formation of the nanoporous 3D structure by inducing the collision and loss of kinetic energy during deposition. A photocatalytic material, TiO2, was grown on the porous structure of SnO2 to detect target gas, formaldehyde, under UV irradiation selectively. Microstructural and elemental analysis with a transmission electron microscope and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the porous structure of SnO2 induced by our evaporation process as well as the conformal coating of TiO2 on the porous structure. The sensing capabilities of a photoactive sensor on the formaldehyde were assessed in terms of the film porosity, irradiated UV power, and thickness of photoactive materials at room temperature. As a result, the SnO2@TiO2 heterostructure, with an optimum thickness of TiO2 exhibited low detection limit, down to 0.1 ppm, good linearity to the concentration of formaldehyde in the range of 0.1–10 ppm, and high response of 15% in the HCHO 0.1 ppm.

High emissivity MoSi2–ZrO2–borosilicate glass multiphase coating with SiB6 addition for fibrous ZrO2 ceramic,"To develop a high emissivity coating on the low thermal conductivity ZrO2 ceramic insulation for reusable thermal protective system, the MoSi2–ZrO2–borosilicate glass multiphase coatings with SiB6 addition were designed and prepared with slurry dipping and subsequent sintering method. The influence of SiB6 content on the microstructure, radiative property and thermal shock behavior of the coatings has been investigated. The coating prepared with SiB6 included the top dense glass layer, the surface porous coating layer and the interfacial transition layer, forming a gradient structure and exhibiting superior compatibility and adherence with the substrate. The emissivity of the coating with 3wt% SiB6 addition was up to 0.8 in the range of 0.3–2.5μm and 0.85 in the range of 0.8–2.5μm at room temperature, and the “V-shaped grooves” surface roughness morphology had a positive effect on the emissivity. The MZB-3S coating showed excellent thermal shock resistance with only 1.81% weight loss after 10 thermal cycles between 1773K and room temperature, which was attributed to the synergistic effect of porous gradient structure, self-sealing property of oxidized SiB6 and the match of thermal expansion coefficient between the coating and substrate.

Effect of α and γ polymorphs of alumina on the preparation of MgAl2O4-spinel-containing refractory cements,"The use of aluminous refractory materials containing MgAl2O4-spinel has led to a major breakthrough in the service life of refractory coatings applied in the industries and in the quality of the products. Many researches have been conducted to improve the synthetic procedures in order to reduce the production cost of these materials. In this way, refractory cements involving in situ generated spinel phase have been obtained from mixtures of active alumina and dolomites. Other investigations have demonstrated that γ alumina is advantageous in comparison with the α polymorph in the synthesis and sintering properties of pure MgAl2O4-spinel. In this article, the performance of both polymorphs of alumina, used as raw materials in the preparation of the refractory cements, along with dolomite proceeding from Olavarría, in the centre of Buenos Aires Province (Argentine), is compared. The thermal and structural changes which take place during the firing of the batches up to 1450°C were studied by the combination of diffractometric and infrared spectroscopy data, at the most remarkable reaction steps. According to these results, the study of phase changes within the investigated thermal range allowed to establish the main differences in the composition of both mixtures in each firing step. Independently of the type of alumina used, a mixed phase product consisting of spinel, as a major phase, accompanied by CaAl2O4 (CA) and CaAl4O7 (CA2), as secondary phases, was obtained.

The Ce: YAG ceramics doping with different Gd3+ content is labeled as Gd-doping structure. The red phosphor film placing Ce: YAG ceramic close to the chips is labeled as R–Y structure, similarly, the red phosphor film adjacent to the chips is named as Y-R structure. The main emission peak has redshift with Gd content increase. The PL spectra have a shift to the red region with the increasing of the red phosphor content in the R–Y structure and Y-R structure. As-prepared samples were further fixed on the substrate to manufacture the ceramic covered film (CCF)-based LEDs and ceramic-based LEDs. The color temperature can be regulated through the three structure. The luminous efficacy in the R–Y structure, Y-R structure, and Gd-doping structure is 89.16 lm/w, 86.8 lm/w, and 62.9 lm/w at about 3500K, respectively. The CRI in the R–Y structure, Y-R structure, and Gd-doping structure is 64.6,68.8, and 62.2 at about 3500K, respectively. The temperature in the R–Y structure, Y-R structure, and Gd-doping structure 83.3 °C, 81 °C, and 124.7 °C at about 3500K, respectively. The heat dissipation capability of R–Y structure and Y-R structure are superior to that of the Gd-doping structure. The result shows that the R–Y structure has the best luminous efficacy at a similar CCT which improved 41.7% comparing to the Gd-doping structure. The Y-R structure has the best CRI (improve 10.6% comparing to the Gd-doping structure) and heat dissipation capability (decreased 35.1% comparing to the Gd-doping structure) at a similar CCT. The way of Ce: YAG ceramic coated CaAlSiN3: Eu2+ phosphor will be a promising candidate to achieve warm white for high power LEDs.","Qian, Xinglu;Li, Yang;Shi, Mingming;Yang, Bobo;Zheng, Fei;Liu, Zizhuan;Zou, Jun",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Ce,YAG ceramic,Phosphor film,High-power white LED",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.145,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.145
Mechanical and tribological properties of nano/micro composite alumina coatings fabricated by atmospheric plasma spraying,"Adding nano particles can significantly improve the mechanical properties and wear resistance of thermal sprayed Al2O3 coating. However, it still remains a challenge to uniformly incorporate nano particles into traditional coatings due to their bad dispersibility. In the present work, nanometer Al2O3 (n-Al2O3) powders modified by KH-560 silane coupling agent were introduced into micrometer Al2O3 (m-Al2O3) powders by ultrasonic dispersion to afford nano/micro composite feedstock, and then four resultant coatings (weight fraction of n-Al2O3: 0%, 3%, 5% and 10%) were fabricated by atmospheric plasma spraying. The features and constitutes of feedstock and as-sprayed coatings, as well as their porosity, bonding strength, microhardness and frictional behaviors were investigated in detail. Results show that the nano/micro composite feedstock with uniform microstructure can be better melted in the spraying process, thereby obtaining coatings with denser microstructure, higher hardness and bonding strength. Added n-Al2O3 has no obvious effect on the friction coefficient of composite coatings, whereas can improve their wear-resistant and reduce the worn degree of counterpart. The wear mechanism of traditional coating is brittle fracture and lamellar peeling, while that of composite coating with weight fraction of n-Al2O3 of 10% is adhesive wear.","An, Yulong;Li, Shuangjian;Hou, Guoliang;Zhao, Xiaoqin;Zhou, Huidi;Chen, Jianmin",2017-04-15,Ceramics International,"Nano alumina,Atmosphere plasma spraying,Microstructure,Mechanical properties,Friction and wear behavior",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.01.072,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.01.072
Influence of inhomogeneous thermally grown oxide thickness on residual stress distribution in thermal barrier coating system,"Residual stress is a significant factor to understand failure mechanism of thermal barrier coating system (TBCs). In this work, the residual stress was studied by finite element method during a thermal cycle load. A complicated model was proposed to study the effect of inhomogeneous thickness of thermally grown oxide (TGO). The top ceramic coating (TC), TGO, bond coating (BC) and substrate were assumed to be viscoelastic and the plastic behavior of BC was taken into consideration. The material parameters of four layers are temperature dependent. The residual stress distributions along TC/TGO and BC/TGO interfaces were determined. The influence of nonuniform TGO thickness on residual stress was discussed by comparing with uniform TGO thickness. Meanwhile, the effect of different TGO roughness was studied. The results show that inhomogeneous TGO thickness has complicated effects on residual stress. The effect on stress values near peak and valley of TC/TGO and BC/TGO interfaces is relatively large. And residual stress distributions of TC/TGO interface vary a lot for most cases. The stress levels of the two interfaces increase obviously with the augment of TGO roughness. These results help to understand the failure mechanism of TBCs.","Chen, Zhi;Huang, Hongmei;Zhao, Kai;Jia, Wenbin;Fang, Lei",2018-10-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating system,Residual stress,Interface thickness,Interface roughness",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.134,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.134
Highly selective NO2 sensor based on p-type nanocrystalline NiO thin films prepared by sol–gel dip coating,"Nanocrystalline NiO thin films were synthesized on ITO substrates by a sol–gel dip coating method using the mixture of NiC4H6O4·4H2O, NH3·H2O and C3H8O as the precursor. Structure of NiO thin films was characterized by means of X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, and the results showed that the films were composed of cubic NiO nanocrystalline particles having diameters in the range of 20–30nm, which provides a large specific surface area. NiO thin films showed p-type semiconductor behavior due to the non-stoichiometry. A band gap of 3.75eV was obtained by UV–vis measurement. The sensor based on NiO thin films demonstrated a good reversibility and repeatability to NO2 at evaluated operating temperatures. The films also showed an excellent NO2 selectivity compared to formaldehyde, ethanol, methanol, xylene, hydrogen, ammonia and methane at 150°C, demonstrating a potential application in low-energy consumption gas sensor devices.","Zhao, Sikai;Shen, Yanbai;Zhou, Pengfei;Zhang, Jin;Zhang, Wei;Chen, Xiangxiang;Wei, Dezhou;Fang, Ping;Shen, Yansong",2018-01-31,Ceramics International,"NiO,Sol–gel dip coating,Thin film,NO2,Gas sensor",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.243,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.243
Electrophoretic deposition of fiber hydroxyapatite/titania nanocomposite coatings,Hydroxyapatite/titania nanocomposite coatings were electrophoretically deposited from ethanolic suspensions of titania and fiber shaped hydroxyapatite (FHA) nanoparticles. Triethanolamine (TEA) was used to enhance the colloidal stability of particles in suspensions. Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) was performed using the suspensions with different concentrations (wt%) of titania/FHA particles. EPD rate decreased more rapidly with time for suspensions with higher wt% of FHA due to the higher voltage drop over the deposits shaped from them. Stacking of long FHA particles on the substrate during EPD resulted in the formation of coarse pores in the deposits. It was found that titania nanoparticles can more efficiently infiltrate through and fill the pores in TEA containing suspensions due to the stronger electrostatic repulsion force between pore walls (FHA) and titania nanoparticles in them. The coatings deposited from the suspensions with 50wt% of FHA or more did not crack during drying due to the significant reinforcement action provided by high wt% of FHA in them. Nanocomposite coatings deposited from TEA containing (2mL/L) suspensions with 50 and 75wt% of FHA had the best corrosion resistance in simulated body fluid (SBF) solution due to their crack-free microstructure and efficiently filled pores.,"Farrokhi-Rad, Morteza",2018-01-31,Ceramics International,"Electrophoretic deposition (EPD),Fiber shaped hydroxyapatite (FHA) particles,Titania nanoparticles,Nanocomposite coatings,Ethanol",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.221,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.221
Pseudocapacitive performance of manganese oxide coated hierarchical cobalt oxide structure prepared by hydrothermal process,"In the present study, a manganese (Mn) oxide deposited hierarchical cobalt (Co) oxide structure was prepared as a supercapacitor electrode by a two-step hydrothermal process. A Co-oxide hierarchical structure was first prepared as a template on a graphite substrate by hydrothermal and post heat treatment (calcination) processes. Subsequently, the Mn-oxide was deposited onto the surface of the Co-oxide template to form a Mn-oxide coated hierarchical Co-oxide structure by a secondary hydrothermal process. The effects of calcination time on the material characteristics and pseudocapacitive performance of the Mn-oxide coated structure were investigated. Experimental results showed that the microstructural properties of hydrothermally synthesized Co-oxide with a snowflake-like morphology varied with the calcination conditions. A great improvement of > 100% in capacitance of the Mn-oxide coating was obtained by using a template with a Co-oxide hierarchical structure. Moreover, with high capacitance, the excellent cycling stability of the Mn-oxide coated hierarchical Co-oxide structure exhibited high potential for practical application as a pseudocapacitor.","Lin, C.-K.;Lin, P.-C.;Shih, S.-J.;Chang, C.-J.;Shi, J.-B.;Chen, C.-Y.",2017-08-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Preparation of Pt/beta zeolite–Al2O3/cordierite monolith for automobile exhaust purification,"A two-step route was developed to prepare zeolite beta coatings on structured monolith. Al2O3 layer was deposited on cordierite substrate by slurry dip-coating in the first step and beta zeolite layer was then coated on Al2O3/cordierite by direct dynamic hydrothermal synthesis in the second step. The as-prepared beta zeolite–Al2O3/cordierite was characterized by means of XRD and SEM techniques and the stability of beta coatings was studied. Based on these results, the advantages of the two-step method were discussed.

Effect of impurities on dispersion properties of alpha-alumina powder,"Ceramic powders frequently have traces of different ions remaining from powder manufacturing. To understand how much the impurities will change the dispersion behaviour the powders were characterised very carefully. This study was focused on the surface composition and the dispersion behaviour of two α-Al2O3 powders from different manufacturing processes in aqueous suspensions at various pH. Several techniques have been used to determine the degree of dispersion (dispersion stability). More attention has been paid to moderate particle concentrations where the dissolved impurities play a decisive role. The variation in surface composition between the powders led to differences in initial dispersion pH and in the magnitude and sign of the initial mobility (zeta potential) of the dispersion. Both observations show the importance of examining ceramic powder dispersions near the concentrations that are used to process the material, e.g., slip casting or dip-coating.","Mikkola, Pasi;Ylhä, Pia;Levänen, Erkki;Rosenholm, Jarl B.",2004-12-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Porous Si3N4 ceramics prepared via slip casting of Si and reaction bonded silicon nitride,"Slip casting process combined with reaction bonded silicon nitride (RBSN) was used to prepare porous Si3N4 ceramic with near-net and complex shape. A butyl stearate (BS) coated process was introduced to restrain the hydrolysis of Si, and ammonium polyacrylate (NH4PAA) was used to enhance the dispersion of coated Si. The measured oxygen content showed that the hydrolysis of Si was strongly prohibited by BS coating, and relatively low viscosity was obtained with the addition of 0.25–1.5wt% NH4PAA to the 60wt% solid load slurry. 40–60wt% solid load slurries were used for slip casting in the experiment. After vacuum degassing, slip casting, debindering and nitridation, a density of 1.57–1.92g/cm3 (porosity 50.9–40%) and a flexural strength of 47–108MPa were obtained. The samples without vacuum degassing showed a large number of nanowires grown in the large pores.","Yao, Dongxu;Xia, Yongfeng;Zeng, Yu-Ping;Zuo, Kai-hui;Jiang, Dongliang",2011-12-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Thermal stability and oxidation resistance of C/Al2O3 composites fabricated from a sol with high solid content,"To improve fracture toughness of monolithic Al2O3 ceramics, three-dimensional carbon fiber preform was used as reinforcement, and the C/Al2O3 composites without interfacial coating were fabricated through vacuum impregnation-drying-heat treatment route with an Al2O3 sol as starting material. Characteristics of the Al2O3 sol with high solid content were firstly analyzed. Then thermal stability and oxidation resistance of the C/Al2O3 composites were investigated. It is found that the Al2O3 sol is an appropriate raw material for the fabrication of C/Al2O3 composites. The C/Al2O3 composites with a total porosity of 15.5% show a flexural strength of 208.5MPa and a fracture toughness of 8.1MPam1/2. Strength loss is observed after the composites were annealed at 1400°C and 1600°C under inert atmosphere. Oxidation resistance of the C/Al2O3 composites is unsatisfactory because of the existence of open pores and microcracks. When Al2O3 matrix was modified with SiO2, the oxidation resistance is remarkably improved due to the viscous flow effect of SiO2.","Fan, Chaoyang;Ma, Qingsong;Zeng, Kuanhong",2017-10-01,Ceramics International,"Alumina,Composites,Sol,Oxidation resistance,Thermal stability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.138,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.138

The microstructure, thermal shock and isothermal oxidation resistance of the coating were investigated. HfC nanowires could improve the toughness of the coating and suppress the coating cracking. After incorporating HfC nanowires in the coating, both of the thermal shock and isothermal oxidation resistance of the coating were obviously improved. The multilayer coating with HfC nanowires could effectively protect C/C composites at 1773K for 270h, whose weight loss is only 0.19%. The good oxidation resistance is mainly attributed to the formation of a compound glass layer containing SiO2 and Cr2O3.","Ren, Jincui;Zhang, Yulei;Hu, Heng;Zhang, Pengfei;Fei, Tian;Zhang, Leilei",2016-10-31,Ceramics International,"Coating,Hfc nanowires,Cabon/carbon composites,Oxidation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.064,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.064
Enhancement of the compressive strength of highly porous Al2O3 foam through crack healing and improvement of the surface condition by dip-coating,"Highly porous ceramic foams with open or closed cells have a wide variety of industrial applications, such as high-temperature filtration, absorption, catalyst support, lightweight materials, and high-temperature structural components. The mechanical strength of these highly porous ceramics decreases when the porosity in the foam reaches 90%. This work investigated the preparation of a highly porous Al2O3 substrate with a porosity of approximately 90% using a direct foaming technique, and coatings were deposited onto the substrate using Al2O3 slips prepared with powders of different particle sizes via a dip-coating process. Upon coating the surfaces of the foam, the surface condition was improved, and cracks were healed, producing a versatile material with good compressive strength. The interface between the Al2O3 coatings with different particle sizes and the substrate was analysed by observing the microstructure of the specimens, and their compressive strengths were compared with the compressive strength of an uncoated specimen after sintering at 1600°C and 1700°C for 1h.","Ahmad, Rizwan;Ha, Jang-Hoon;Song, In-Hyuck",2014-03-31,Ceramics International,"Porous ceramics,Dip-coating,Alumina,Compressive strength",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.09.057,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.09.057
"Influence of the synthesis conditions on the microstructural, compositional and morphological properties of graphene oxide sheets","In this paper we report about the synthesis and characterization of graphene oxide (GO). We monitor the effects of the different synthetic processes on the morphological and structural properties of the materials. A modified Hummers' method is adopted to obtain GO powder; H2SO4 is employed as intercalating agent, to increase the distance between graphitic layers, while KMnO4 is used as oxidizing reagent for introducing the oxygen functionalities in the graphitic structure. The oxidized graphite powder is treated in acid solution; different washing cycles are applied. The recovered powders are dispersed in aqueous solution and sonicated for 30 min or 60 min, respectively. Subsequently, these solutions are deposited on Si and SiO2(317 nm)/Si substrates by means of dip coating. GO powders, GO solutions and GO on substrate are characterized through several analytical and spectroscopic techniques. These analyses reveal that the sonication time and the washing procedure of the samples can influence the structure and the morphology of the graphene oxide flakes. Moreover, when KOH is employed as alkaline agent in a chemical reducing treatment of the GO powder before sonication, a considerable alteration of the native structure of graphene oxide is observed. The detailed characterization indicates that the properties of the GO samples are strongly influenced by the chemical and physical treatments to which it is subjected.","Burresi, E.;Taurisano, N.;Protopapa, M.L.;Latterini, L.;Palmisano, M.;Mirenghi, L.;Schioppa, M.;Morandi, V.;Mazzaro, R.;Penza, M.",2020-10-01,Ceramics International,"Graphene oxide,X-ray spectroscopy,Hummers method",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.222,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.222
Fabrication of amorphous silica coating on graphite substrate by laser cladding,"An amorphous silica coating was prepared on graphite substrate by laser cladding to improve the ablation resistance using a silicon interlayer as a transition layer. The laser cladding processes were carried out in the air atmosphere, which can simplify production conditions. The amorphous silica coating is uniform and dense, combining well with the graphite substrate. There is no obvious boundary between the silicon transition layer and the silica coating.

Improving the rheological and stability characteristics of highly concentrated aqueous yttria stabilized zirconia slurries,"Highly concentrated yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) aqueous suspensions with improved rheology and stability characteristics are desired in several fields of modern ceramic engineering such as Suspension Plasma Sprayed (SPS) coatings. In this study, water-based suspensions of YSZ with 30 wt% solid loading were selected to investigate the effect of pH, dispersant type and its concentration on the dispersion and rheological properties of the suspensions. Polyethyleneimine solution (PEI), 2-phosphonobutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid (PBTCA) and alpha-Terpineol ( α -Terpineol) were used as dispersant agents. Careful investigations of the suspensions were conducted through viscosity, zeta potential, turbidity, destabilization kinetics, and sedimentation rate measurements. The results showed that dispersant addition, when combined with proper pH adjustment, can significantly decrease the suspensions' viscosity values and improve their stabilities. Optimum viscosity and stability conditions, defined as viscosities lower than 4 cp and Nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) higher than 3000 were obtained with 0.1 wt% PEI addition at pH value of 2.5, 0.05 wt% PBTCA at pH value of 10.5 and 0.1 wt% α -Terpineol at pH value of 2.5.","Yaghtin, Maryam;Yaghtin, Amirhossein;Tang, Zhaolin;Troczynski, Tom",2020-12-01,Ceramics International,"Aqueous YSZ suspension,Rheology,Stability,Dispersant",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.176,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.176
Preparation of innovative metallic composite glazes for porcelainized stoneware tiles,"Innovative metallic glazes for porcelain stoneware tiles, containing stainless steel and a special Ni-based alloy (NiCoCrAlY, commonly used as bond coating material in thermal barrier coating systems on Turbogas superalloy components), have been studied.

The fabrication and characterization of sintered diatomite for potential microfiltration applications,"Porous ceramic membranes have lately become a subject of special interest due to their outstanding thermal and chemical stability. We investigated whether a sintered diatomite support layer could also serve as a separation layer to minimize any processing difficulties, and investigated whether the support layer and the separation layer could be made from the same material to avoid a thermal mismatch during a high-temperature sintering process. We prepared sintered diatomite as a porous ceramic membrane for microfiltration, as diatomite particles are inherently porous and irregular. The pore characteristics of the sintered diatomite specimens were studied by scanning electron micrography, mercury porosimetry, and capillary flow porosimetry.","Ha, Jang-Hoon;Oh, Eunji;Song, In-Hyuck",2013-09-30,Ceramics International,"A.

Mechanical and thermal properties of double-layer and triple-layer thermal barrier coatings with different ceramic top coats onto polyimide matrix composite,"The present study has discussed the deposited thermal barrier coatings of Cu-Sn/mullite and Cu-Sn/NiCrAlY/YSZ onto a carbon-fiber reinforced bismaleimide (BMI) matrix composite. The thicknesses of the metallic bonding layers and ceramic top coats were 100µm and 300µm, respectively. The microstructural, mechanical and thermal properties of the TBC systems were evaluated through x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), tensile adhesion strength testing (TAT), micro-hardness tests, roughness measurement, thermal shock testing and laser flash analysis (LFA). A comparison of the microstructure of the ceramic top coats showed that the YSZ had a homogeneous structure with high crystallinity while the mullite exhibited a multi-phase structure containing mullite, alumina (γ-Al2O3) and amorphous phases. The mullite layer recorded higher residual stress than that the YSZ layer because of its higher Young's modulus and the transformation of the mullite phase to alumina and amorphous phases during deposition. The adhesion strength of the sample with a triple-layer coating was greater than that with a double-layer coating because it exhibited a milder residual stress gradient across the coating. The thermal shock resistance of the triple-layer coated sample was 1.5-fold greater than that of the double-layer coated sample. This could be due to the existence of an oxidation-resistant layer of NiCrAlY and smaller differences in the coefficients of thermal expansion between coating layers in the triple-layer coating system. Thermal conductivity of the triple-layer coating sample was much less than that of the double-layer coating which can increase the operating temperature of the polymeric substrate to a higher value.","Abedi, H.R.;Salehi, M.;Shafyei, A.",2017-10-15,Ceramics International,"TBC,Residual stress,YSZ,Mullite,Adhesion strength,Thermal shock",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.164,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.164
Preparation and properties of plasma sprayed strontium-doped calcium polyphosphate coating for bone tissue engineering,"The purpose of this study was to scale-up the usage of strontium-doped calcium polyphosphate (SCPP) to major load-bearing applications in bone substitute application. SCPP powders were used to prepare biological coatings on titanium (Ti) substrates by plasma-spraying under a series of different conditions. Microstructure and bonding strength (with titanium substrates) of the SCPP coatings were investigated by an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer, X-ray diffraction analysis, a scanning electron microscope and a strength test machine. The results showed the main crystal type of coating remained β-crystal SCPP. The surface and cross-sectional morphologies of coatings showed that the SCPP coatings were fairly dense. The bonding strength between the SCPP and Ti was higher than normal plasma spraying coatings. Furthermore, the research on the interactions between ROS17/2.5 cells and various SCPP coatings-Ti substrates indicated that the coating-implants possessed good cytocompatibility with osteoblasts.

Wear behavior of BCS glass ceramic coating on stainless still slab,"The present study aims to assess the friction and wear characteristics of BSC glass-ceramic on 304L stainless steel, fabricated by air spray method. The dry sliding friction and wear behavior were investigated using a 4 mm diameter AISI52100 steel pin on disk geometry under 3–39 N loads, at different sliding speeds in dry conditions. Average friction coefficients (COF)and wear rates were varied in the range between 0.6–0.8 and 26 × 10−2–0.001 mm3/N m respectively. The results show that, the frictional behavior of glass-ceramic-metal couples depended on the metal transferred from the steel pin to the glass-ceramic's surface and the applied loads. It was found that the running–in period of G39 last shorter than the G3 one, also in the case of G39 the steady state friction coefficient was lower than G3. The wear tracks were examined using scanning electron microscope, it was revealed that, the intrinsic porosity of coat has affected on the amounts of debris as an important factor for the COF values.","Faeghinia, A.;Zamanian, A.",2019-01-31,Ceramics International,"Glass-ceramic,Wear,COF,Coat,BCS,Sliding",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.139,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.139
Tribological performances of the boron carbide coatings sliding against silicon carbide and silicon nitride balls under various relative humidity conditions,"Boron carbide (B4C), silicon carbide (SiC) and silicon nitride (Si3N4) can achieve low coefficient of friction (Cof) under high relative humidity condition. Therefore, B4C/SiC and B4C/Si3N4 tribo-pairs may exhibit outstanding tribological behaviors, while the tribological investigation is poor. In present investigation, we performed the friction tests of the B4C/SiC and B4C/Si3N4 tribo-pairs under various relative humidity conditions, and revealed that the B4C/SiC tribo-pair is a promising candidate for high relative humidity engineering applications. Surprisingly, the B4C/SiC tribo-pair exhibited much better tribological behaviors than the B4C/Si3N4 tribo-pair with the same test condition and tribochemical products. This is mainly attributed to less wear debris on the SiC ball and the formation of a stable tribochemical film containing boric acid and silica gel.","Cao, Xueqian;Shang, Lunlin;Liang, Yongmin;Lu, Zhibin;Zhang, Guangan;Xue, Qunji",2020-02-15,Ceramics International,"Friction and wear,B4C coating,Relative humidity,Boric acid,Silica gel",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.008
Influence of pores on mechanical properties of plasma sprayed coatings: Case study of YSZ thermal barrier coatings,"This paper presents a thorough study on plasma sprayed 8 wt% Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 (8YSZ) thermal barrier coatings intended to show the effect of the internal microstructure especially the pores on mechanical properties of plasma sprayed coatings. The internal microstructure of 8YSZ thermal barrier coatings was analyzed comprehensively by image processing technology combined with fractal theory. The mechanical properties of 8YSZ coatings were tested by the instrumented indentation testing. And the stress distribution in three models with different microstructure of coatings was analyzed in depth by the finite element method. It was found that plasma sprayed 8YSZ thermal barrier coatings have a typical layered structure and contain many microscopic defects such as microcracks and pores. The pore size distribution of plasma sprayed 8YSZ coatings obey the logarithmic normal distribution, and the pore diameter inside the coating is mainly concentrated between 1 and 10 µm. With the increase of high temperature thermal exposure time, the average diameter of pores gradually decreased from 9.30 µm to 5.96 µm, and the porosity of the ceramic top coat is reduced from 9.38% to 5.79%. Fractal characterization results showed that after a certain period of thermal exposure, the ceramic top coat become densified, and the internal pore structure is regularized with the fractal dimension decreased from the initial value of D1 = 1.26 to the D6 = 1.12 after 200 h. The indentation testing results showed that after 200 h of high temperature thermal exposure, the hardness of 8YSZ coatings increased from 2.52 GPa to 3.12 GPa, and the elastic modulus increased from 32.3 GPa to 43.6 GPa. The results of finite element analysis showed that the complex pore structure inside the coating will lead to stress concentration, which were largely affects the mechanical properties of 8YSZ coatings.","Qiao, X.;Wang, Y.M.;Weng, W.X.;Liu, B.L.;Li, Q.",2018-12-01,Ceramics International,"Plasma sprayed coatings,Fractal theory,Instrumented indentation testing,Finite element method,Stress distribution",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.220,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.220
Superhydrophobic coatings prepared from methyl-modified silica particles using simple dip-coating method,"A simple and time-saving approach for preparing self-cleaning superhydrophobic silica coatings using a dip-coating technique is reported in this study. Commercially available silica particles were modified with methyl groups using methyltrichlorosilane as a modifying agent. By adopting a multi-layer deposition process, a superhydrophobic silica coating with a water contact angle of 153°±2° and roll-off angle of 8°±1° was obtained. The prepared silica coating exhibited excellent self-cleaning performance; moreover, it was able to maintain superhydrophobicity under the impact of a water jet. This method could be an effective strategy for fabricating self-cleaning superhydrophobic surfaces for promising industrial applications.","Gurav, Annaso B.;Xu, Qingfeng;Latthe, Sanjay S.;Vhatkar, R.S.;Liu, Shanhu;Yoon, Hyun;Yoon, Sam S.",2015-03-31,Ceramics International,"Superhydrophobic,Dip coating,Silica,Interface,Self-cleaning",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.10.137,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.10.137
Microstructure and fretting behavior of hard TiN-based coatings on surgical titanium alloys,"An original nitriding method [powder immersion reaction assisted coating (PIRAC)] for improving wear resistance of Ti-based surgical alloys was developed. CP Ti and Ti–6Al–4V alloy samples were annealed in sealed stainless steel containers that allow selective diffusion of nitrogen atoms from the atmosphere. The microhardness-microstructure and nitrogen concentration relationship were studied for TiN-based PIRAC coatings grown at 850–1100°C. Phase identification and microstructure characterization of nitrided samples were performed by XRD, SEM/EPMA and HRSEM. The effect of PIRAC coating on fretting behavior of Ti–6Al–4V was studied in vitro under conditions simulating in vivo conditions at the interface of modular orthopedic implants. A significant reduction in friction coefficient and fretted areas was measured for the coated samples.","Shenhar, A;Gotman, I;Radin, S;Ducheyne, P",2000-08-03,Ceramics International,Surgical titanium alloys,10.1016/S0272-8842(00)00008-0,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0272-8842(00)00008-0
Recession behavior of a silicon nitride with multi-layered environmental barrier coating system,"A silicon nitride with multi-layered environmental barrier coating (EBC) system was prepared. The multi-layered coating consisted of a thin Lu2Si2O7 bond coat, Lu2Si2O7/mullite eutectic intermediate layer, and a top Lu2Si2O7 layer. A glassy phase was observed on the top Lu2Si2O7 surface of the as-coated sample. The glassy phase was converted into Lu2Si2O7 and Lu2SiO5 phases via a heat treatment at 1500°C in Ar. The recession test was performed at 1300°C for 500h using high-speed steam jet equipment, which was employed to simulate the gas turbine engine conditions. Post-test examinations showed that the multi-layered EBC system well sustained during the high-temperature steam exposure test. Also, the silicon nitride substrate was protected from the oxidation and corrosion, and thus no material recession was observed. However, some cracks that run through the EBC layer was observed in the sample after the test. The substrate near the cracks oxidized, leading to the formation of a thermally grown oxide phase.","Ueno, Shunkichi;Ohji, Tatsuki;Lin, Hua-Tay",2007-07-31,Ceramics International,"B. Surface,C.

Preparation and dielectric properties of dense and amorphous alumina film by sol–gel technology,"Dense and crack-free aluminum oxide films were fabricated by sol–gel spin-coating technology. Aluminum nitrate (Al(NO3)3.9H2O) was used as the precursor material. X-ray diffraction shows that the fabricated films are amorphous. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms that the thin films are alumina (Al2O3). Field-emission scanning electron microscopy images of the films reveal that the films are compact with a dense cross section. Dielectric measurements were carried out on samples with a metal–insulator–metal structure. The electrical characteristics of the films were affected by the thermal sintering temperature of the films. The leakage current density of the films decreases with the increase in the sintering temperature and increases with the increase in the measuring temperature. The leakage current shows a linear dependence on the voltage in the low-electric field-regime. The current density ascends to higher values due to the effect of space charges in the high-electric-field regime. The ionization energy of the top-electrode metals (Au, Pt or Ti–Au) has a strong effect on the leakage current.","Hu, Baofu;Yao, Manwen;Yang, Pengfei;Shan, Wei;Yao, Xi",2013-09-30,Ceramics International,"A.

Fabrication and characterization of Ba(Zr0.84Y0.15Cu0.01)O3−δ electrolyte-based protonic ceramic fuel cells,"Protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) were successfully fabricated by using 15mol% Y-doped BaZrO3-based electrolytes that have fairly good electrical conductivity and chemical stability. In order to overcome the poor sinterability of the BaZrO3-based electrolytes, which is a critical limitation in making a thin-film electrolyte for electrode-supported PCFCs, we utilized sintering aid-assisted enhanced sintering by adding 1mol% of CuO, thereby reducing the sintering temperature of the constrained thin electrolyte on a rigid electrode substrate to below 1500°C. From the process optimization of the thin BZYCu coating on the NiO–BZYCu anode substrate, we fabricated a 10-μm-thick thin and dense electrolyte layer that exhibited an open-circuit voltage (OCV) close to that of the theoretical OCV of 0.98V. However, improving the electrochemical performance by optimizing the electrode microstructure, especially in terms of the electrochemical activity of the anode and the current-collecting efficiency of the cathode, is the major concern of forthcoming study.","Choi, Sung Min;Lee, Jong-Heun;Ji, Ho Il;Yoon, Kyung Joong;Son, Ji-Won;Kim, Byung-Kook;Je, Hae June;Lee, Hae-Weon;Lee, Jong-Ho",2013-12-31,Ceramics International,"E.

"Copper incorporation in Mn2+-doped Sn2S3 nanocrystals and the resultant structural, optical, and electrochemical characteristics","Sn2S3 nanocrystals (NCs) with both Mn2+ doping and Cu2+ incorporation were synthesized using a chemical bath deposition method. The Cu2+ ions formed an anorthic Mn2+-doped Cu2SnS3 structure with E g = 1.44 eV, which altered the material's optical and photo/electrochemical properties. After coating the bare Nb2O5 electrode with Mn2+-doped Sn2S3 or Mn2+-doped Cu2SnS3 NCs, the photoluminescence spectrum was blue-shifted to 411.13 nm from 411.69 nm. Compared to the sample without Cu2+, the Cu2+-incorporated sample showed a slightly stronger emission at the same position, possibly due to disorder in the crystalline structure based on variations at the interface of Mn2+-doped Cu2SnS3 NCs. Electrochemical analysis showed a lower charge transfer resistance in the Mn2+-doped Cu2SnS3, which is related to its larger electroactive surface area. The larger electroactive surface area is attributed to the Faradaic redox processes at the electrode surface, which suppresses the carrier recombination. The coexistence of Cu2+ and Mn2+ ions shortened the electron transport pathway at the interface and improved the carrier diffusion coefficient and diffusion length, leading to a higher specific capacitance that implies higher energy storage performance. Finally, the I-V characteristics of the Mn2+-doped Cu2SnS3-coated Nb2O5 electrode under various light illumination conditions indicated its better efficiency in photoresponse, electron generation, and charge collection, owing to a superior charge transport mechanism. Detailed results were obtained about the charge dynamics in the as-prepared photo/electrochemical devices with Cu2+ incorporation in the Mn2+-doped SnS3 electrode.","Noppakuadrittidej, Prae;Vailikhit, Veeramol;Teesetsopon, Pichanan;Choopun, Supab;Tubtimtae, Auttasit",2018-08-15,Ceramics International,"Manganese-doped tin sulfide,Manganese-doped copper tin sulfide,Nanocrystal,Photo/electrochemical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.247,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.247
Preparation and oxidation behavior of B4C–Ni and B4C–TiB2–TiC–Ni composite coatings produced by an HVOF process,"In this study, B4C–Ni and B4C–TiB2–TiC–Ni composite coatings were thermally sprayed on the surface of 4130 steel substrate by a high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) torch. Before the HVOF process, the B4C–Ni and B4C–TiB2–TiC–Ni composite powders were prepared by mechanical alloying (MA) and spray drying processes. In order to study the oxidation behavior of coatings, thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) was done at three temperatures of 500, 700 and 900°C for 35h. Structural evolution of powder particles and coatings was investigated by X-ray diffractometry (XRD). The morphology and microstructure of powder particles and the coatings were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was found that during TGA experiments of B4C–Ni coating, spallation was occurred at all temperatures, indicating the formation of non-protective oxide scale on the surface of this coating. First oxidation and then with increasing time, spallation were the predominant processes at 700 and 900°C. No spallation was seen in TGA experiments of B4C–TiB2–TiC–Ni coating. Formation of the protective oxide scale on the surface of this coating decreased the oxidation rate with increasing time.","Rafiei, M.;Salehi, M.;Shamanian, M.;Motallebzadeh, A.",2014-09-30,Ceramics International,"A.

Preparation and catalytic properties of Cu2O–CoO/Al2O3 composite coating prepared on aluminum plate by microarc oxidation,"In order to develop a catalyst with a high activity and stability for the catalytic wet peroxide oxidation (CWPO) process under ambient conditions, A Cu2O–CoO/Al2O3 composite coating was prepared on an aluminium substrate by microarc oxidation in a phosphate electrolyte modified with Cu(Ac)2 and Co(Ac)2 solutions. Microstructure, phase and chemical composition of the coating were characterized by SEM, XRD and XPS, respectively. The Al-supported Cu2O–CoO/Al2O3 composite coating exhibited excellent catalytic activities for CWPO of methyl orange under ambient conditions. The degradation efficiency of methyl orange was 99.8% at 25°C for 12h, or 100% at 65°C for 90min. The catalyst exhibited an excellent chemical stability with negligible leaching ions.

Oxidation behavior of SiBC matrix modified C/SiC composites with different PyC interphase thicknesses,"A series of SiBC matrix modified C/SiC composites (C/SiC–SiBC) with different pyrolytic carbon (PyC) interphase thicknesses (50–300nm) were fabricated by a joint process of chemical vapor infiltration, slurry infiltration and liquid silicon infiltration. Oxidation behavior of C/SiC–SiBC composites with different PyC interphase thicknesses in the temperature range of 800–1200°C was studied. When the C/SiC–SiBC composites were exposed at 800°C for 10h the oxidation kinetics was controlled by diffusion rate of oxygen through matrix micro-cracks and coating defects, and the effect of PyC interphase thickness on weight loss was apparent. At higher oxidation temperatures (>1000°C) the in-depth diffusion of oxygen was slowed down due to healing of matrix micro-cracks by borosilicate glass, and the oxidation kinetics was controlled by diffusion rate of oxygen through coating defects. Weight loss of all the C/SiC–SiBC composites was greatly reduced and was less affected by PyC interphase thickness. The flexural strength of C/SiC–SiBC composites rapidly decreased after oxidization at 800°C although thicker PyC interphase brought a little improvement and it rose up as temperatures increased above 1000°C due to the non-uniform degradation of carbon fibers.","Cao, Xiaoyu;Yin, Xiaowei;Ma, Xiaokang;Fan, Xiaomeng;Cheng, Laifei;Zhang, Litong",2015-01-31,Ceramics International,"Oxidation behavior,C/SiC composites,Self-healing,Melt infiltration,Chemical vapor infiltration",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.09.111,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.09.111
Mechanical strength and biocompatibility of bredigite (Ca7MgSi4O16) tissue-engineering scaffolds modified by aliphatic polyester coatings,"Bredigite (Ca7MgSi4O16) is a bioceramic with excellent bioactivity and bioresorbability; nonetheless, its inadequate mechanical strength and biocompatibility limit its tissue-engineering application. In this research, interconnected porous bredigite scaffolds were fabricated by sol-gel, sacrificial sponge replica and sintering processes for bone tissue engineering. In order to improve their strength and cytocompatibility, the scaffolds were coated with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) via immersion in acetone-based solutions containing different concentrations (5, 10 and 15% w/v) of the polymer. Based on the results, the PLGA coatings to 10% do not suppress the porosity characteristics of the scaffolds appropriate for tissue engineering. It was also found that the polymeric coatings significantly enhance the compressive strength of the ceramic scaffolds, where this alteration is improved by increasing the PLGA concentration of the coating solution. In addition, the viability of stem cells on the bredigite scaffolds are improved by using the PLGA coatings, with the optimal concentration of 10% PLGA according to MTT and cell attachment studies.","Jadidi, A.;Salahinejad, E.",2020-07-31,Ceramics International,"Sol–gel processes,Silicate,Mechanical properties,Biomedical applications",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.206,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.206
Mullite-modified ZrB2-MoSi2 coating for carbon/carbon composites to withstand long term ablation,"There are two prominent challenges when coating carbon/carbon composites with ultra-high temperature ceramics to withstand long term ablation. One is the decrease of coating strength under high ablation temperature, and the other is the volatilization of produced glass phase. Due to excellent creep resistance, mullite-modified ZrB2-SiC coating was here investigated, and coating microstructure, the composition and ablation behavior were studied. Results showed a dense scale was formed on the surface layer and it alleviated the volatilization of glass phase. Meanwhile, the strip-shaped particles of mullite pinned in the middle layer and a firm framework with ZrO2 particles filling in the interspaces was constituted, which prevented the peeling off of the coating. After oxyacetylene flame ablation for 600s, mass ablation rate of the modified ZrB2-MoSi2 coating was − 1.91 × 10−3 g/s, which exhibited better ablation resistance compared with a traditional ZrB2-MoSi2 coating.","Liu, Xuezhang;Deng, Chunming;Deng, Changguang;Liu, Min;Zhou, Kesong",2018-03-31,Ceramics International,"C/C composite,Mullite,Plasma spraying,Coating,Ablation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.025
Deposition and characterization of bioactive ceramic hydroxyapatite coating on surface of Ti–15Zr–5Nb alloy,"The new ternary Ti–15Zr–5Nb alloy is non-toxic and non-allergenic and possesses very good mechanical and anticorrosive properties. A ceramic hydroxyapatite (HA) coating was deposited on this new alloy surface by a chemical method. The formation of HA was proved by Raman micro-spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which identified the main characteristic features for the crystalline HA. This ceramic coating has an optimal microstructure and morphology (from scanning electron microscopy). Also, a pronounced roughness was indicated by 2D and 3D atomic force microscopy images, showing a very proper surface for the adherence of the bone cells. The electrochemical behavior and corrosion resistance of this ceramic HA coating were studied in Ringer solutions. The main electrochemical parameters had more favorable values for the HA coated alloy due to the protective effect of the coating that thickened the native passive film on the alloy surface and together acted as a barrier against the ion diffusion. The HA coating increased the corrosion resistance of the substrate by its resistive properties to a large extent. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data were modeled by a two time constants electric equivalent circuit for the bare alloy and with a three time constant circuit for the HA coated alloy (formed from inner oxide layer, porous oxide layer and respectively outer HA porous layer). The HA coating thickened over time, improving its bioactivity and assuring long-term corrosion resistance. Therefore, the new Ti–15Zr–5Nb alloy coated with ceramic HA satisfies the most exigent requirements and signifies a progress in the domain of the orthopedic implant alloys.","Vasilescu, Cora;Popa, Monica;Drob, Silviu Iulian;Osiceanu, Petre;Anastasescu, Mihai;M.

"Design, selection and characterization of novel glasses and glass-ceramics for use in prosthetic applications","The objective of this work is to design and characterize crystallizable silicate and borosilicate compositions for use in the production of smart, unconventional coatings on bioceramic implants. The concept behind this research is the development of a three-layer implantable system (joint prosthesis) comprising a ceramic substrate, a glass-derived trabecular coating and a glass-ceramic interlayer that joins the other two elements together. The outer porous coating should exhibit bone-like architecture, high mechanical strength and good bioactivity to bond to bone, whereas the interlayer should be chemically stable in biological fluids to avoid detachment between the joined parts. Glasses in the SiO2–Na2O–K2O–CaO–P2O5–B2O3–Al2O3 system have been synthesized by a melting route and thermally treated to obtain glass-ceramic products. A selection of potentially suitable materials for the trabecular coating and interlayer was carried out on the basis of thermal properties and tendency to dissolve in simulated body fluids (SBF) so that the integrity of the final device might be maintained upon implantation. The glass selected for the trabecular coating was processed by sponge replica method to produce glass-ceramic scaffolds, in order to evaluate the material properties and performance in an embodiment plausibly close to the final application. The mechanical properties of the porous glass-ceramic, which mimicked the 3-D pore architecture of cancellous bone, were adequate for load-bearing applications such as joint prostheses. Formation of a surface apatite layer on scaffold struts upon soaking in SBF confirmed the excellent bioactivity of the material, which is a key precondition for in vivo osteointegration.","Baino, Francesco;Marshall, Martyn;Kirk, Nicholas;Vitale-Brovarone, Chiara",2016-01-31,Ceramics International,"D.

Strain-induced multiscale structural changes in lamellar thermal barrier coatings,"The thermal mismatch stress, as well as residual stress, in coating/substrate systems often leads to structural changes and subsequent coating debonding in the systems. This study focused on the changes induced in the microstructure and properties of lamellar yttria-stabilized zirconia coatings upon heating, with the aim of elucidating their starting microstructure prior to sintering. The results showed that the combined effect of the residual stress and the thermal mismatch stress results in scale-sensitive changes in the properties of the coatings. The macroscale properties changed significantly, while the microscale properties changed only slightly. Structural characterization revealed that a certain degree of expansion at the tips of both the intersplat pores and the intrasplat cracks occurs, contributing to the microscale structural changes observed in most regions. Moreover, a few mesoscale cracks covering several layers were also observed. A lamellar structural model was developed to correlate the multiscale structural changes observed with those in the properties. Finally, this study revealed that the actual starting structure of plasma-sprayed thermal barrier coatings prior to sintering is different from that in the as-deposited state. This should aid in obtaining an in-depth understanding on the microstructural and properties evolution of the constrained coatings under actual service conditions.","Li, Guang-Rong;Yang, Guan-Jun;Li, Cheng-Xin;Li, Chang-Jiu",2017-02-01,Ceramics International,"Plasma spraying,Multiscale structural changes,Thermal barrier coatings,Mechanical properties,CTE mismatch strain",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.11.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.11.009

Qualitative analyses indicate that monoclinic Y4Al2O9 was formed at about 1000 °C, and exhibited good phase stability throughout the annealing temperature ranging from 1000 °C to 1400 °C. The thermophysical properties of Y4Al2O9 ceramics were also evaluated compared with 8YSZ and La2Zr2O7. The determined activation energy of crystal growth is about 72.71 ± 0.31 kJ mol−1. Meanwhile, Y4Al2O9 represents low thermal conductivity (1.71 W m−1 K−1), moderate thermal expansion coefficient (8.73 × 10−6 K−1), and high sintering-resistance ability.

Analysis of the micromechanical properties of copper-silicon carbide composites using nanoindentation measurements,"The study presents a detailed analysis of the impact of the coating type of silicon carbide particles and its share by volume on the microstructure and micromechanical properties of Cu-SiC composites. In order to protect the carbide from decomposition during the manufacturing of the composites, the surface of SiC was modified via a plasma vapour deposition (PVD) technique with a layer of metals (W, Cr, Ti and Ni). Composites with a variable share of the ceramic phase (10–50 vol.%) were obtained at a temperature of 950°C using spark plasma sintering. An analysis of the structures of the composites, especially in the metal-ceramic boundary region, was conducted with the use of scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The mechanical properties of the composites in the Cu-interface-SiC system were studied via a nanoindentation technique. The comparison of the results of hardness and Young's modulus studies were completed in relation to the actual structures of the materials, which in turn made it possible to determine the impact of the interfacial structure on the global properties of the composite materials.","Chmielewski, Marcin;Nosewicz, Szymon;Wyszkowska, Edyta;Kurpaska, Łukasz;Strojny-Nędza, Agata;Piątkowska, Anna;Bazarnik, Piotr;Pietrzak, Katarzyna",2019-05-31,Ceramics International,"Copper-silicon carbide composites,Nanoindentation,SPS,Interface study",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.257,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.257

The phase-structure, micro-morphology and thermal-physical properties of RE2AlTaO7 (RE = Gd and Yb) oxides were analyzed. The RE2AlTaO7 (RE = Gd and Yb) oxides exhibit single pyrochlore-type crystal-structure. Compared to Yb2AlTaO7, the Gd2AlTaO7 has greater thermal conductivity owning to relatively weaker phonon scattering. Because of higher electro-negativity of Yb, the Yb2AlTaO7 has lower coefficient of thermal expansion than Gd2AlTaO7. The RE2AlTaO7 (RE = Gd and Yb) oxides also exhibit no phase-transition between ambient and 1473 K.","Xiaoge, Chen;Hongsong, Zhang;Yanxu, Liu;Yongde, Zhao;Bo, Ren;An, Tang;Kui, Lu",2018-06-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Rare earth-aluminum-tantalum oxides,Thermal conductivity,Thermal expansion coefficient",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.113,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.113
Synthesis and characterizations of Ni0.8Zn0.2Fe2O4-MWCNTs composites for their application in sea bed logging,"Sea bed logging is new technique for the detection of hydrocarbon reservoir. Magnitude of EM waves is important for the detection of deep target hydrocarbon reservoir below 4000m from the sea floor. A new aluminium based EM transmitter is developed and NiZn (Ni0.8Zn0.2Fe2O4) ferrite with and with out multiwall carbon nano tubes (MWCNTs) polymer composites as magnetic feeders are used in a scaled tank. Nickel zinc ferrite plays an important role in many applications due to its best magnetic properties. Nanocrystalline NiZn (Ni0.8Zn0.2Fe2O4) ferrite and novel Ni0.8Zn0.2Fe2O4-MWCNTs composites were prepared by sol–gel route. The samples were sintered at 750–950°C and were characterized by XRD, FESEM, HRTEM and Raman spectroscopy. Single phase of Ni0.8Zn0.2Fe2O4 having [311] major peak was obtained by sol–gel method at 750°C and 950°C. FESEM micrographs show that grain size increases with the increase of sintering temperature and ranges from 24 to 60nm. FESEM and HRTEM results showed coating of Ni0.8Zn0.2Fe2O4 on MWCNTs and show better morphology at the sintering temperature of 750°C. The magnetic properties measured from impedance vector network analyzer showed that sample (Ni0.8Zn0.2Fe2O4-MWCNTs) sintered at 750°C have higher initial permeability (20.043), Q-factor (50.047), and low loss factor (0.0001) as compared Ni0.8Zn0.2Fe2O4-MWCNTs sintered at 950°C. Due to better magnetic properties, Sample (Ni0.8Zn0.2Fe2O4-MWCNTs sintered at 750°C) composites were used as magnetic feeders for the EM transmitter. It was found that magnitude of EM waves from EM transmitter increased up to 243% by using Ni0.8Zn0.2Fe2O4-MWCNTs polymer composites.","Akhtar, Majid Niaz;Yahya, Noorhana;Koziol, Krzysztof;Nasir, Nadeem",2011-12-31,Ceramics International,"Nano structured materials,Multiwall carbon nano tubes,XRD,FESEM,HRTEM,Magnitude vs. offset (MVO)",10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.05.113,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.05.113
"Effects of TiO2 on microstructural, mechanical properties and in-vitro bioactivity of plasma sprayed yttria stabilised zirconia coatings for dental application","One of the most compatible coatings, known as yttria-stabilised zirconia polycrystal (YZP) is deposited on metallic Ti alloys due to its excellent hardness and aesthetic value as well as its low affinity for plaques. However, poor bioactivities of YZP and the existence of micro crack propagations due to the aging of YZP may result in spontaneous implant failure thus limiting its clinical use. In this work, YZP coating reinforced titania (TiO2), which is formed via a plasma spray technique was investigated in order to enhance the bioactivity and the mechanical properties of YZP coatings for dental implants. Based on microstructural studies performed on the deposited coating, a distinguished lamellar structure comprising YZP and TiO2 was observed. It was found that the reinforcement of TiO2 in YZP coating significantly reduced the crack due to the improved densities and the lamellar structure. The mechanical properties were also found to improve with 90% of hardness, 45% of adhesion strength and 54% of Young's Modulus with TiO2 addition, which is desirable for dental implants. An in-vitro bioactivity test was then conducted by immersing the coatings in a simulated body fluid (SBF). As a result, an apatite formation was found on the YZP/TiO2 coating surface after 3 days of immersion. Besides, it was verified in an XRD analysis that the crystalline TiO2 was found in a rutile phase which was highly effective in generating apatite (natural mineral in human bones) on YZP coatings, proving that the bioactivities of the coating were significantly improved. Further studies were also performed on the SBF treatment, which took up to 14 days also demonstrated that only a small decrease in hardness was noted, indicating that YZP/TiO2 coatings had reached an excellent mechanical stability.","Jemat, A.;Ghazali, M.J.;Razali, M.;Otsuka, Y.;Rajabi, A.",2018-03-31,Ceramics International,"Dental material,Mechanical properties,Yttria stabilised zirconia (YZP),TiO2,Bioactivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.008
Boron nitride nanoplatelets induced synergetic strengthening and toughening effects on splats and their boundaries of plasma sprayed hydroxyapatite coatings,"Boron nitride nanoplatelets (BNNPs) with excellent mechanical properties were introduced into HA coatings fabricated through plasma spray in this research. SEM observation and Raman results revealed the added BNNPs retained their original structure even after harsh process and distributed homogeneously in the as-sprayed coatings. As compared with the monolithic HA coating, a 2.0 wt%BNNP/HA coating exhibited significant improvement (~ 40.3%) in fracture toughness and moderate enhancement (~ 20.0%) in indentation yield strength. Synergetic strengthening and toughening mechanisms which are operative through splat boundaries and individual splats were proposed. At splat boundaries, these embedded BNNPs induced stronger adhesion between the adjacent splats to resist splat sliding, which is evident from the fact that the calculated inter-splat friction force of an as-sprayed BNNP/HA coating was increased by ~7.3% at 2.0% BNNP weight fraction. Within splats, toughening mechanisms such as BNNP pullout, crack bridging by both anchored BNNPs and nanosized HA grains, crack deflection and crack propagation arrested by the embedded BNNPs were observed to improve toughness. Moreover, thermal mismatch between HA matrix and BNNPs during cooling process after plasma spray would induce the pre-existing dislocations formed around these BNNP nanofillers, which was assumed to hold out the effect of Orowan-type strengthening within splats.","Zhu, Jiaying;Chen, Yao;Ren, Jia;Zhao, Dong;Liu, Weiwei",2018-06-15,Ceramics International,"B.

Deposition of graded SiO2/SiC coatings using high-velocity solution plasma spray,"Carbon/carbon (C/C) composites are widely used in structural components, particularly in the aerospace and aeronautics sectors. However, the application of C/C composites is limited by low oxidation resistance at high temperatures. In order to overcome this problem, graded SiO2/SiC coatings were deposited on C/C composites by a high-velocity solution plasma spray (HVSPS) process. Graded coatings were formed by reactions between the Si(OH)4 sprayed liquid precursor and the C/C substrate; these reactions were promoted by the high temperature of the plasma torch. The morphologies, microstructures, and chemical compositions of the coatings were investigated by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. By altering the deposition time, the coating thickness was controlled, therefore demonstrating SiC formation and realizing graded SiO2/SiC coatings.","Miranda, F.S.;Caliari, F.R.;Campos, T.M.;Essiptchouk, A.M.;Filho, G.P.",2017-12-15,Ceramics International,"Solution plasma spray,Supersonic plasma torch,Ceramic coatings,Graded coatings",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.018
Wear rate of titanium matrix composite coating at high temperature further increased by non-stoichiometric TixC oxidation,"Elevated-temperature tribological behaviors of titanium matrix composite (TMC) coatings are investigated. Results indicate that TMC coatings experience increased wear rates at 500 °C combined with ploughing, delamination, and oxidation wear mechanisms. The hybrid TiB + TiC reinforced Ti64 composite coating shows a higher wear rate than composite solely reinforced by TiB at 500 °C. Nevertheless, the hybrid TMC coating exhibits a relatively lower wear rate at room temperature. In addition, it has been revealed that the reverse order of wear rate is attributed to the non-stoichiometric characteristic of the TixC ceramic phase in hybrid composite, which is preferentially oxidized at elevated temperature, leading to the remarkable decrease of wear resistance. Meanwhile, the high thermal stability of TiB ceramic contributes to the low wear rate of TiB/Ti6Al4V coating at 500 °C.","An, Qi;Huang, Lujun;Jiang, Shan;Wang, Shuai;Zhang, Rui;Sun, Fengbo;Moridi, Atieh;Geng, Lin",2020-04-15,Ceramics International,"Titanium matrix composite coating,TiB,Non-stoichiometric TixC,Oxidation,High-temperature wear",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.032,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.032
Oxidation behavior of SiC/glaze-precursor coating on carbon/carbon composites,"In order to improve the oxidation behavior of carbon/carbon composites in a wide range of temperature, a new SiC/glaze-precursor coating was developed.The SiC layer was produced by slurry and sintering, while the glaze precursor layer was prepared by slurry and drying. The microstructures and phase compositions of the coating were analyzed by SEM and XRD, respectively. The oxidation resistance of the coated composites was investigated using both isothermal and temperature-programmed thermogravimetric analysis in the temperature range from room temperature to 1600°C. The results showed that the oxidation behavior of the coating was mainly controlled by the diffusion of oxygen during the test.The coating showed excellent oxidation resistance and self-healing ability in a wide range of temperature.","Jiao, Xingjian;Li, Tongqi;Li, Yumei;Zhang, Zhongwei;Dai, Fuzhi;Feng, Zhihai",2017-08-01,Ceramics International,"Carbon/carbon composites,SiC,Coating,Oxidation behavior",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.148,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.148
New phase formation in Al2O3-based thermal spray coatings,"Alumina phases formed in Al2O3 coatings and nanocomposite coatings of Al2O3–SiC, Al2O3–Mo were investigated. The coatings were prepared using high velocity oxy fuel spraying (HVOF) and air plasma spraying (APS) techniques on mild steel substrate either with Ni5Al or Ni20Cr bond layer. The amount of SiC and Mo were varied from 2 to 8 and 12 to 22mass%, respectively. X-ray diffraction technique was used for phase characterisation. All the coatings showed the presence of varied amounts of well-known alumina phases, α- and γ-Al2O3, in the as-sprayed condition and after heat treatment up to 700°C. In addition, a new highly oriented phase, referred to as U phase and characterised by an orthorhombic unit cell with a=8.644Å, b=8.286Å, c=4.922Å, was observed in all the alumina-based coatings. In as-sprayed condition, the U phase appeared in all the coatings prepared with Ni5Al bond layer and not in others. The new phase developed in other coatings, without bond layer or with Ni20Cr bond layer, under favourable energetics, i.e., after mild heat treatment at temperature as low as 100°C and even due to mechanical stresses induced during cutting or peeling.","Uma Devi, M",2004-12-31,Ceramics International,"B.

Water vapor corrosion behaviors of plasma sprayed ytterbium silicate coatings,"In this work, the water vapor corrosion behaviors of plasma sprayed ytterbium silicate coatings with different contents of Yb2O3, Yb2SiO5 and Yb2Si2O7 phases were evaluated at 1400oC for 100–300 h and the influence of phase compositions on the corrosion behaviors was analyzed. The results showed that severe corrosion took place in the Yb2Si2O7-rich coating with a porous reacted layer with a thickness about 20 μm after 300 h corrosion. The Yb2O3 phase in the Yb2O3-rich coatings volatilized, lefting a relatively dense reacted layer with a thickness about 5–6 μm after the same corrosion time. A layer composed of Yb2SiO5 was formed on the surface of all the corroded ytterbium silicate coatings. This study may provide theoretical basis for selecting rare-earth silicate environmental barrier coatings (EBCs) with excellent performance.","Wang, Yawen;Niu, Yaran;Zhong, Xin;Shi, Minhao;Mao, Fengqi;Zhang, Le;Li, Qilian;Zheng, Xuebin",2020-12-15,Ceramics International,"Ytterbium silicates,Plasma sprayed coatings,Water vapor corrosion,Phase compositions",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.324,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.324
Analysis of instrumented scratch hardness and fracture toughness properties of laser surface alloyed tribological coatings,"The mechanical characteristics of ceramic matrix composite (CMC) coatings are widely different from the same materials in bulk form or the individual constituents and are very important to be assessed to carry out application oriented studies on CMC coatings with novel compositions. In the present work, a composite coating of TiB2, TiN and SiC is fabricated in-situ through a combination of high temperature chemical reaction and laser surface alloying. The formation of the surface layer is due to the laser-assisted chemical reaction followed by laser melting. A mixture of TiO2, SiO2, hBN and graphite in stoichiometric proportions is used as the precursor for the chemical reaction. The presence of all the reaction products in the CMC coatings developed is confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). A thorough evaluation of various mechanical properties achieved more insight into the CMC coatings developed. Hardness and fracture toughness of the coatings are measured with a scratch tester. The property evaluations are performed in a similar way for two more coatings fabricated with precursor mixtures containing more than a stoichiometric amount of SiC and hBN respectively. For comparison, a number of composites fabricated through various other routes are characterized afresh with the same set of techniques. Coatings formed with SiC in precursor show higher values of scratch hardness (14.37GPa), microhardness (24.37GPa) and fracture toughness (6.63MPa-m1/2).","Misra, Debjit;Shariff, S.M.;Mukhopadhyay, Suman;Chatterjee, Satyajit",2018-03-31,Ceramics International,"Laser,Ceramic matrix composite,Coating,Fracture toughness,Scratch hardness,Brittleness index",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.005
Wear behavior of graded Cr-CrN-Cr(1−x)Al(x)N coatings synthesized by closed-field unbalanced magnetron sputtering for advanced machining operations,"Graded Cr-CrN-Cr(1−x)Al(x)N coatings were synthesized onto M42 HSS substrates used in advanced machining operations by closed-field unbalanced magnetron sputtering (CFUBMS). The tribological behavior of these graded coatings was explored in detail by advanced electron microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy, nanoindentation and dry sliding wear tests. The presence and magnitude of residual stresses in these coatings were determined by the XRD – sin2ψ method, which revealed increasing compressive stresses with increasing Al content. The coating surface morphology, mechanical properties were determined prior to dry sliding wear by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and nanoindentation methods, which yielded decreasing surface roughness (Ra) as well as enhancement of hardness and modulus along with increase in H/E and H3/E2 ratios with increasing Al content. Tribological investigation was performed with a pin-on-disc arrangement by keeping the sliding velocity (0.2 ms−1) and normal axial load (10 N) constant and varying the sliding distance. Specific wear rates of the order ~ 10–17 m3 N−1 m−1 were encountered for all coatings with the wear rates increasing as the Al content increased implying a decrease of wear resistance of the coatings. Abrasive wear has been found to be the dominant wear mechanism during dry sliding wear. Increasing modulus mismatch between coating and substrate can be mainly attributed to a decrease in wear resistance of the coatings.","Kabir, Mohammad Sharear;Munroe, Paul;Zhou, Zhifeng;Xie, Zonghan",2018-05-31,Ceramics International,"Graded Cr-CrN-Cr(1−x)Al(x)N coatings,Magnetron sputtering,Compressive stress,Dry sliding wear,Abrasive wear",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.199,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.199
Effects of microstructure and electrochemical properties of Ti/IrO2–SnO2–Ta2O5 as anodes on binder-free asymmetric supercapacitors with Ti/RuO2–NiO as cathodes,"Ti/IrO2–SnO2–Ta2O5 was prepared by thermal decomposition. The phase structure, surface morphology and capacitive properties of the electrodes annealed at different temperatures were analyzed in detail. The electrodes annealed at 370 °C had the largest area of the cyclic voltammogram, the smallest Zim, the minimum relaxation time, and the largest specific capacitance of 382.9 F/g, which was lager than those of IrO2–SnO2 and IrO2–Ta2O5. The conductive nanocrystalline particles was homogeneously distributed in the amorphous matrix, which could greatly improve the conductivity of electrons in coatings, but it did not sacrifice the conductivity of protons. Ti/IrO2–SnO2–Ta2O5 electrodes prepared at 370 °C and Ti/RuO2–NiO electrode prepared in the same way were assembled to be a supercapacitor, which provided energy density of 12.8wh kg−1 and 1.86wh kg−1 respectively and the power density of 29w kg−1 and 252.7w kg−1. The energy density and power density in acidic solution could be detected without using binder materials. The prepared method was simple, economical and did not require binder which provided a possibility for the large-scale industrial production of pseudocapacitor.","Zhang, Yanbin;Ma, Qiongqiong;Feng, Keke;Guo, Jie;Wei, Xinli;Shao, Yanqun;Zhuang, Jianhuang;Lin, Tianshun",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"Annealing temperature,Crystallinity,Ti/IrO2–SnO2–Ta2O5,Binder-free electrode,Ti/RuO2–NiO",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.066,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.066
Wettability and infiltration of Si drop on silica substrate containing α-Si3N4 coating: Influence of oxygen content in α-Si3N4 coating,"The preparation of solar grade silicon (Si) is popularly carried out in silica (SiO2) crucible containing porous α-Si3N4 coating, in which poorly wetting SiO2 film around α-Si3N4 particles act as barrier for Si infiltration. The present investigation studies the influence of oxygen (O) content in coating on wettability and infiltration for Si/α-Si3N4/SiO2 ternary system. The amorphous SiO2 film surrounding Si3N4 particles is firstly synthesized by pre-oxidizing coating in air, and the O content is controlled by adjusting pre-oxidizing temperature and holding time. In this work, dynamic wetting behavior of Si drop on coating containing various content of O is investigated using the sessile drop method. Meanwhile, via microstructural analysis, infiltration under the drop and infiltration beyond the drop (including infiltration on coating surface and under coating surface) are distinguished on coatings with different O content. Finally, wettability transformation (from wetting to non-wetting) is analyzed; mechanism of infiltration resistance for O in coating is interpreted by analytical model.","Wang, Qinghu;He, Gang;Deng, Shuxiang;Liu, Jun;Li, Jiangtao;Li, Yawei;Pan, Liping;Liu, Guanghua;Li, Xiaoyu;Li, Jianqiang",2020-06-01,Ceramics International,"Oxygen content,Silicon,α-Si3N4 coating,Wettability,Infiltration",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.036,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.036
Interfacial delamination of double-ceramic-layer thermal barrier coating system,"Thermal barrier coating system (TBCs) must withstand the most demanding high temperature conditions where state-of-the-art top coat material Y2O3–stabilized ZrO2 may undergo significant sintering and phase change. The concept of double-ceramic-layer (DCL) TBCs seems to be an effective way to meet the need for both thermal stability and transformation toughening. In this paper, a virtual crack closure technique based interface element method is introduced to study the mechanics associated with the interfacial delamination of DCL TBCs. The evolution of energy release rate of interfacial delamination is explored for DCL TBCs with various geometrical and material parameters. Analysis of fracture mechanisms of delamination reveals that considering the integrated thermal and mechanical functionalities of coatings an optimal thickness ratio of outer to inner ceramic layers exists, which can be preliminarily evaluated by running numerical calculations of fracture parameters and performing thermal life experiments over a wide range of thickness ratios of outer to inner coating layers. In addition, the influence of separation centered at the interface of two ceramic layers is also examined. It is demonstrated that the local separation between two ceramic layers makes delamination readily to form and propagate at the interface between the inner coating and the underlying layer.","Fan, Xueling;Xu, Rong;Wang, T.J.",2014-11-30,Ceramics International,"A: Films,B: Failure analysis,C: Fracture,E: Substrates",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.05.095,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.05.095
Comparative study on tribological and corrosion protection properties of plasma sprayed Cr2O3-YSZ-SiC ceramic coatings,"In this research, the tribological and corrosion protection properties of atmospheric plasma sprayed Cr2O3-20YSZ (CZ) and Cr2O3-20YSZ-10SiC (CZS) composite coatings on 304 L stainless steel substrates were evaluated and compared to pure Cr2O3 (C) coating. Microstructural evaluations were carried out using an optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) equipped with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS). The ball-on-disk wear test was performed using an alumina counterpart at room temperature. The protective efficiency of the coatings with/without sealing treatment was evaluated by electrochemical potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in a 3.5 wt% NaCl solution. Evaluation of wear tracks showed that enhancement of the wear resistance of the composite coatings was ascribed to the zirconia phase transformation toughening and the presence of more ductile tribofilms participated in pore filling during the wear. The corrosion measurements revealed that the protection properties of the coatings were strongly dependent on the porosity content so that the as-sprayed coatings due to their porous nature could not protect the substrate. However, filling the porosity using an epoxy sealant prevented the penetration of the corrosive environment into the substrate and therefore increased the protective efficiency of the coatings. Moreover, the density of the unfilled defects such as micro-cracks determines the protection properties of the sealed coatings, so that the CZ coating due to its highest toughness had the lowest micro-crack density and thus the highest protective efficiency.","Hashemi, S.M.;Parvin, N.;Valefi, Z.;Alishahi, M.",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Cr2O3-YSZ-SiC,Ceramic matrix composite,Thermal spray coating,Tribological/corrosion behavior,Multimodal/nano",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.087,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.087
Ex-polymer SiC coatings with Al2O3 particulates as filler materials,"Ceramic-on-metal coatings can be made by pyrolyzing pre-ceramic polymers. However, the large shrinkage associated with the transformation of the initial polymer into the final ceramic material usually leads to cracks, which develop when the thickness of the coating exceeds a critical value.

The structural and optical properties of HfO2 thin films related to annealing temperature are investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–vis), and spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE). Results indicate that the monoclinic form of HfO2 appears when temperature rises through and above 500°C. The reduction in band gap is observed with the increase of annealing temperature. Moreover, the increase of refractive index (n) and density and the decrease of the extinction coefficient with the increase of annealing temperature are obtained by SE measurements. Additionally, the electrical properties based on Al/Si/HfO2/Al capacitor are analyzed by means of the high frequency capacitance–voltage (C–V) and the leakage current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics.

High-temperature interactions of desert sand CMAS glass with yttrium disilicate environmental barrier coating material,"A calcium-magnesium aluminosilicate (CMAS) glass was prepared by melting a sample of desert sand to evaluate the high-temperature interactions between molten CMAS and yttrium disilicate (Y2Si2O7), an environmental barrier coating (EBC) candidate material. Cold-pressed pellets of 80 wt% Y2Si2O7 powder and 20 wt% CMAS glass powder were heat treated at 1200 °C, 1300 °C, 1400 °C and 1500 °C for 20 h in air. The resulting phases were evaluated using powder X-ray diffraction.

Scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy and electron microprobe analysis were used to evaluate the microstructure and phase compositions of specimens after heat treatment. An oxyapatite silicate (Ca2Y8(SiO4)6O2) phase was identified in all specimens after CMAS exposure regardless of heat treatment temperature. Apatite appeared to form by dissolution of Y2Si2O7 into molten CMAS, reacting with CaO in the melt according to the reaction 4Y2Si2O7 + 2CaO → Ca2Y8(SiO4)6O2 + 2SiO2, and followed by precipitation of the apatite phase.","Wiesner, Valerie L.;Harder, Bryan J.;Bansal, Narottam P.",2018-12-15,Ceramics International,"CMAS,Glass,Environmental barrier coating,Yttrium disilicate (Y2Si2O7)",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.058,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.058

Study on energy consumption of Al2O3 coating prepared by cathode plasma electrolytic deposition,"Al2O3 coatings with large specific surface were prepared on cast nickel-based superalloy K418 by cathode plasma electrolytic deposition (CPED) in aqueous solutions at different concentrations. The significance of energy consumption and a simple calculation method during CPED were proposed, and the influence of electrolyte concentration on current density-voltage curve, energy consumption, and microstructure of coatings were studied. It was found that increasing the concentration of electrolyte can effectively reduce the current density at the initial stage while prolonging the deposition time and stepping up the energy consumption of whole coating preparation. The morphology observation results showed that the pore size of Al2O3 coatings enlarges with the increase of the concentration, and the optimum electrolyte concentration is 0.5–1molL−1.

Different hydrothermal corrosion results between two sides of sodalime float glass and the possible corrosion mechanism,"Sodalime float (SF) glass is widely used in our societies and industries. Hydrothermal corrosion method is one of the effective ways to prepare a superhydrophobic glass, but there is still lack of knowledge about hydrothermal corrosion behavior and mechanism of SF glass. We have hydrothermally treated SF glass at 180 °C for different time, and tried to reveal the aqueous corrosion process of SF glass. We have characterized the morphologies and chemical compositions of samples, and found that (1) the two sides of SF glass have different corrosion resistances, and (2) a multilayer structural coating with a nanoflake layer (Mg-rich gel layer), a nanowire layer (Ca-rich gel layer), and a porous layer (etched layer) is formed on the air-side of SF glass.

Effects of rare-earth oxide doping on the thermal radiation performance of HfO2 coating,"In this study, the REO-HfO2 (REO = Tb4O7, Gd2O3 and Sm2O3) coatings and pure HfO2 coatings were prepared by atmospheric plasma spraying. The chemical compositions, morphologies, infrared radiation performance and thermal resistances of the coatings were systematically investigated. The experimental results showed that the Tb4O7-HfO2, Gd2O3-HfO2, Sm2O3-HfO2 and pure HfO2 coatings had infrared emissivity values of 0.863, 0.852, 0.854 and 0.621, respectively, at room temperature. Based on the phase analysis, the higher infrared emissivity of the REO-HfO2 coatings could be attributed to the fact that the newly formed RE2Hf2O7 (RE = Tb, Gd and Sm) phase, which had a defective fluorite-type structure, and the RE3+ ions enhanced the lattice absorption and electron absorption. Additionally, the Tb4O7-HfO2 coating exhibited a relatively higher infrared emissivity than those of the Gd2O3-HfO2 and Sm2O3-HfO2 coating over the wavelength range of 1–15 μm, which was due to the relatively higher vibrational frequency of the TbO bond in RE2Hf2O7 (RE = Tb, Gd and Sm) and the transformation of Tb3+ into Tb4+ in the Tb4O7-HfO2 system. In addition, the REO-HfO2 ceramic coatings exhibited excellent thermal resistance, which could withstand high-temperature treatment at 1600 °C for at least 50 h without undergoing a phase change and exfoliation, and the infrared emissivity at different temperatures hardly changed after thermal treatment.","Liu, Fusheng;Cheng, Xudong;Mao, Jiawei;Li, Qingyu;Zeng, Xian",2019-07-31,Ceramics International,"HfO2 coating,Rare-earth oxides,Infrared emissivity,Doping",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.230,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.230
Ag enhanced electrochemical performance for Na2Li2Ti6O14 anode in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries,"Due to the characteristics of an electronic insulator, Na2Li2Ti6O14 always suffers from low electronic conductivity as anode material for lithium storage. Via Ag coating, Na2Li2Ti6O14@Ag is fabricated, which has higher electronic conductivity than bare Na2Li2Ti6O14. Enhancing the Ag coating content from 0.0 to 10.0wt%, the surface of Na2Li2Ti6O14 is gradually deposited by Ag nanoparticles. At 6.0wt%, a continuous Ag conductive layer is formed on Na2Li2Ti6O14. While, particle growth and aggregation take place when the Ag coating content reaches 10.0wt%. As a result, Na2Li2Ti6O14@6.0wt% Ag displays better cycle and rate properties than other samples. It can deliver a lithium storage capacity of 131.4mAhg−1 at 100mAg−1, 124.9mAhg−1 at 150mAg−1, 119.1mAhg−1 at 200mAg−1, 115.8mAhg−1 at 250mAg−1, 111.9mAhg−1 at 300mAg−1 and 109.4mAhg−1 at 350mAg−1, respectively.","Qian, Shangshu;Yu, Haoxiang;Yan, Lei;Li, Peng;Lin, Xiaoting;Bai, Ying;Wang, Songjing;Long, Nengbing;Shui, Miao;Shu, Jie",2016-05-01,Ceramics International,"Na2Li2Ti6O14,Ag coating,Anode material,Rate property,Lithium-ion batteries",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.01.071,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.01.071
Macro-porous Ti2AlC MAX-phase ceramics by the foam replication method,"This paper describes the fabrication of porous Ti2AlC MAX-phase ceramics using the foam replication technique. The influence of heat-treatment cycle and sintering time on phase composition, microstructure and type of defect is discussed. Compression testing indicates that strength is related to defects that are introduced during the foam replication stage, as observed by optical and electron microscopy. The manufacturing process is adapted by employing additional coating stages to produce electrically conductive macro-porous ceramics with a range of strengths (0.2–6.3MPa) and macrostructures. Such materials are of interest for use as a high surface area electrode for harsh environments or microbial fuel cells.","Bowen, C.R.;Thomas, T.",2015-11-30,Ceramics International,"A. Processing,B.

Novel synthesis of CuO nanofiber balls and films and their UV–visible light filteration property,"Self-assembled cupric oxide (CuO) nanofiber balls and films were synthesized via a facile solvothermal route directly from cupric acetate monohydrate (Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O) in water and ethanol without any chemical additions or high temperature treatment. The CuO balls with size of 150nm–1.5µm had rough surfaces which consisted of lots of about 10nm nanofibers in diameter. The sizes of CuO balls were controllable by changing reaction time and volume ratio of water to ethanol. CuO nanofiber films were prepared with the aid of the in situ hydrolysis of Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O coating layer on a substrate at 60°C. CuO films showed excellent UV–visible light filteration property and could be used as a potential candidate of UV–visible light filter. Compared with traditional method to fabricate CuO films, neither precursor nor Cu substrate was needed in this study. This technique could be used to produce CuO films without being confined to our template and to produce CuO powders in large scale with low cost.","Hu, Xiulan;Zhang, Tianyu;Chen, Jinjie;Gao, Haiguang;Cai, Weifeng",2016-05-15,Ceramics International,"Nanofiber balls and films,Solvothermal controllable synthesis,UV–visible light filteration property,CuO",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.02.076,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.02.076
"Comprehensive structural, nanomechanical and tribological evaluation of silver doped DLC thin film coating with chromium interlayer (Ag-DLC/Cr) for biomedical application","Silver (Ag) doping in carbon matrix have shown promising results in anti-bacterial potency. Adhesion of diamond-like-coating (DLC) on steel substrates is inferior; however, this can be circumvented by employing interlayers to it. In the present study, Ag incorporated DLC coating with chromium interlayer (Ag-DLC/Cr) was deposited on surgical SS using cathodic arc deposition technique. The topographical, morphological and structural analysis of the coating was performed using AFM, XRD, Raman spectroscopy and FTIR studies. The nanomechanical and wear performance of the coating was evaluated using nanoindentation, nanoscratch, dry sliding simulated tribotest and Vickers microhardness tests. Depositing chromium interlayer to DLC film resulted in improved hardness, adhesion and elastic modulus of the substrate due to sp3 content and formation of transmittal chromium carbide in the coating. Moreover, Ag doping causes formation of ductile bridges in carbon matrix enabling it to absorb more energy during deformation. While the coating exhibited higher strain hardening exponent and lower plastic work contributing to higher scratch hardness, lower deformation and no pile-up; the coating simultaneously resulted in reduction of wear rate by four orders of magnitude. SEM micrographs suggest emanation of lubricious film during tribotests due to dispersion of soft Ag clusters on the top layer, resulting in lower friction coefficient. Also, the sticky nature of DLC particles on the counter-face acted as an anti-adhesive agent thereby preventing transfer of material from the counterbody during tribotest. Lastly, the friction dynamics during dry sliding and Vickers microhardness test post tribotests highlights enhanced durability of Ag-DLC/Cr coated substrates.","Patnaik, Lokeswar;Maity, Saikat Ranjan;Kumar, Sunil",2020-10-01,Ceramics International,"PVD,Silver doped DLC,316 LVM surgical stainless steel,Nanoindentation,Nanoscratch,Tribology,Adhesion,Abrasion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.048,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.048
Oxidation resistance and mechanical properties of LaB6-MoSi2-SiC ceramic coating toughened by SiC nanowires,"To improve the high-temperature tolerance of carbon/carbon composites, a compact SiC-nanowires toughened LaB6-MoSi2-SiC/SiC (SiCnws-LMS/SiC) coating was designed and fabricated by combination of multiple methods including pack cementation, chemical vapor deposition and supersonic atmospheric plasma spraying. Isothermal oxidation results indicated that the mass loss of LMS/SiC coating decreased from 4.34 ± 0.28% to 1.12 ± 0.23% after oxidation for 200 h at 1773 K benefit from the addition of SiCnws. Absence of obvious cracks and voids in the coating after oxidation test indicated that the interfaces between various phases and SiCnws could obstruct the crack propagation by releasing the thermal stress in the coating. Meanwhile, after the introduction of SiCnws, the bonding strength and flexural strength of the coating were respectively increased by 54.54% and 59.77% compared to the LMS/SiC coating without SiCnws. The improved mechanical properties could be attributed to the pullout and bridging effects of SiCnws, which created multi-scaled reinforcements, thereby enhancing the load bearing capacity to increase the fracture toughness of the coating.","Wang, Changcong;Li, Kezhi;He, Qinchuan;Su, Yangyang;Huo, Caixia;Shi, Xiaohong",2018-10-01,Ceramics International,"Carbon/carbon composites,Coating,SiC nanowires,Oxidation resistance,Mechanical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.045,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.045
Fabrication and properties of ZrC–ZrB2/Ni cermet coatings on a magnesium alloy by atmospheric plasma spraying of SHS powders,"ZrB2 –ZrC/Ni composite powders were successfully produced from a Ni–Zr–B4C system by self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS), and ZrB2 –ZrC/Ni cermet coatings were deposited on a magnesium alloy substrate by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) using the SHS-derived powders as feedstock powders. Microstructure and phase composition of the SHS powders and APS coatings were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, respectively. Microhardness and wear resistance of the coatings were examined by using a Vickers hardness tester and pin-on-desk tribometer. The coatings exhibited lamellar and porous structure, mainly consisting of ZrB2, ZrC and Ni in addition to the by-product ZrO2. The coatings bonded well to the substrate with the bonding strength as high as 16.27MPa. Microhardness and wear resistance of the substrate were significantly improved by the coatings. The wear resistance of the coatings for the substrate initially increased and subsequently decreased with the increase in Ni content. The coating with 30wt% Ni in the feedstock powder displayed the highest microhardness of 525.02±96.08 HV0.1 and the best wear resistance for the substrate.","Xu, Jiaying;Zou, Binglin;Zhao, Sumei;Hui, Yu;Huang, Wenzhi;Zhou, Xin;Wang, Ying;Cai, Xiaolong;Cao, Xueqiang",2014-12-31,Ceramics International,"Atmospheric plasma spraying (APS),Cermet coating,Self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS),ZrC–ZrB2/Ni",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.07.029,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.07.029
Effect of the Al2O3 additive on the high temperature ablation behavior of the ZrC–ZrO2 coating for SiC-coated carbon/carbon composites,"The Al2O3 additive content in the ZrC–ZrO2 composite coating is adjusted by using the supersonic atmosphere plasma spraying method and the coatings are then tested by the oxyacetylene torch. The influence of the Al2O3 additive content on the anti-ablation property is studied. Results show that the ZrC–ZrO2 coating containing 10 vol% Al2O3 owns the lowest surface porosity and the best ablation resistance property. The ablated area is compact and mainly consists of big grains, which is because the addition of Al2O3 can promote the sintering of liquid ZrO2. The formed Al–Zr–O structure can promote the completeness and stability of the ZrO2 scale, which can inhibit the penetration of oxygen.","Huo, Caixia;Zhou, Lei;Guo, Lingjun;Wang, Jiancheng;Li, Yunyu;Sun, Jia;Liu, Lei",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Al2O3,ZrC–ZrO2 composite coating,Anti-ablation property,Carbon/carbon composites",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.014
Investigation of surface-modified anhydrous borax utilisation in raw glazes,"This study aims to determine the feasibility of preparing ceramic glaze using a surface-modified borate, which contributes boron to the composition without the need of a fritting process. In this context, surface modification of anhydrous borax powders (ABP) with magnesium stearate (MgSt) via dry powder coating is investigated. The surface modification of ABP with MgSt is optimised by employing modifier dosage of 0.5, 1, and 2 wt% and coating periods of 30, 60, and 120 min. The resulting powders are comparatively characterised via wettability, solubility, and dispersibility tests. The structural changes in surface-treated ABP are investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analyses. The results indicate that ABP surface could be switched from hydrophilic (17°) to hydrophobic (115°), its water solubility decreased from 40% to 10%, and a coating yield of approximately 74% was achieved with MgSt dosage of 1 wt% at a processing period of 2 h. Furthermore, FT-IR and XPS results indicated that MgSt is mainly coated over the surface of ABP via physical adsorption rather than chemical bonding. The glaze containing surface-treated ABP that was fired at 1050 °C, demonstrated complete melting and surface coverage without defects. Thus, effective dry coating as a single-step approach could be applied to obtain surface-modified ABP, which offers controlled solubility in glaze suspensions with improved dispersibility and excellent glaze coverage of the surfaces.","Akpinar, S.;Yazici, Z.O.;Can, M.F.",2018-10-15,Ceramics International,"Anhydrous borax,Dry coating,Magnesium stearate,Solubility,Glaze",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.050,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.050
SmPO4-coated Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 as a cathode material with enhanced cycling stability for lithium ion batteries,"SmPO4 coated Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 cathode materials were prepared by the precipitation method and calcined at 450°C. The crystal structures and electrochemical properties of the pristine and coated samples are studied by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, electron diffraction spectroscopy, galvanostatic cycling, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). It has been found that the electrochemical performances of the Li-rich cathode material have been substantially improved by SmPO4 surface coating. Especially, the 2wt% SmPO4-coated sample demonstrates the best cycling performance, with capacity retention of 88.4% at 1C rate after 100 cycles, which is much better than that of 72.3% in the pristine sample. The improved electrochemical properties have been ascribed to the SmPO4 coating layer, which not only stabilizes the cathode structure by decreasing the loss of oxygen, but also protects the Li-rich cathode material from side reaction with the electrolyte and increases the Li+ migration rate at the cathode interface.","He, Lei;Xu, Junmin;Han, Tao;Han, Hui;Wang, Yongjian;Yang, Jun;Wang, Jingrong;Zhu, Wenka;Zhang, Changjin;Zhang, Yuheng",2017-04-15,Ceramics International,"Lithium-rich cathode,Surface coating,SmPO4,High columbic efficiency,Cycling stability,Voltage fading",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.01.052,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.01.052
"Sintering resistance of La2Ce2O7, La2Zr2O7, and yttria stabilized zirconia ceramics","La2Ce2O7 (LC), La2Zr2O7 (LZ), and yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) nanostructured powders with different agglomerate structures were successfully synthesized via wet-chemical method, and their high-temperature sintering resistance was systematically studied in this paper. Experimental results indicate that the synthesized nanostructured YSZ sample possessed the highest sintering resistance while nanostructured LC sample had the lowest sintering resistance. Theory of sintering process at initial stage was used to analyze experimental results. Sintering abilities of materials were closely related to their surface energy, lattice and grain boundary diffusion coefficients, and powder morphologies. Moreover, intrinsic sintering resistance (ISR) and extrinsic sintering resistance (ESR) were defined to further clarify the experimental results. ISR is determined by surface energy, lattice and grain boundary diffusion coefficients of the material, while ESR is affected by dimensions and density of raw powders. The highest sintering resistance of YSZ originated from dense initial powder with large size, which led to extraordinary ESR of the sample. ISR of LZ was found to be much better than that of YSZ and LC, while ISR values of LC and YSZ were similar. Finally, as ISR ability of thermal barrier coating (TBC) materials can be clarified by studying the corresponding crystalline size evolution, a feasible approach was proposed to compare ISR ability of novel TBC materials.","Yi, Hao;Che, Junwei;Xu, Zihui;Liang, Gongying;Liu, Xiangyang",2020-10-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Intrinsic sintering resistance,Extrinsic sintering resistance,Sintering mechanism,Ionic diffusion coefficient,Surface energy",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.298,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.298
Repair of SiC coating on carbon/carbon composites by laser cladding technique,"A slurry-based laser cladding technique was used to repair the SiC coated carbon/carbon composites. The oxidation resistance of repaired samples at 1773 K for 10 h was investigated. Samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction pattern, scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscope; its interface characteristics were studied with scratch, thermal shock and internal friction tests. The results show that there is no obvious interface between the newly-formed coating and the original coating, and the newly-formed coating has a much smoother surface. With optimizing parameters, the new coating of 180 μm thickness possesses refined grains, flat surface, dense microstructure and good thermal stability. The number of internal defects in the samples repaired by laser cladding drops, compared with the damaged/undamaged samples. The weight loss of repaired samples decreases by 64.8% in comparison with the damaged ones, and it is almost the same with the undamaged samples according to a test of anti-oxidation behaviors. This is attributed to the enhanced oxidation resistance of dense newly-formed coating, which makes carbon/carbon composites well protected.","Wang, Han-Hui;Li, He-Jun;Shi, Xiao-Hong;Liu, Xue-Song;Kong, Jing-An;Zhou, Hang",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"Coating repair,Carbon/carbon composites,Laser cladding,Oxidation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.005
Hot corrosion behavior of NdYbZr2O7 exposed to V2O5 and Na2SO4 + V2O5 molten salts,"In order to evaluate the application prospects of NdYbZr2O7 as a novel TBC material, NdYbZr2O7 ceramic was synthesized via a solid-state reaction sintering method, and its hot corrosion behavior exposed to V2O5 and Na2SO4 + V2O5 molten salts at 900 °C, 1000 °C, and 1100 °C was comparatively investigated. For the V2O5 salt, the primary corrosion products were granular (Nd,Yb)VO4 as well as cube-like m-ZrO2. The corrosion layer consisted of two distinct layers, one of which was Zr-rich layer and another was V-rich layer. In the case of Na2SO4 + V2O5, NaVO3, as an intermediate product, played an important role in dissolving the NdYbZr2O7 ceramic. Herein, the (Nd,Yb)VO4 exhibited a rod/plate-like morphology, which could be attributed to the synergistic effect of low driving force and low nucleation rate. Since the molten salt infiltration rate was superior to the pore filling rate throughout the hot corrosion, the thickness of corrosion layer increased with the rise of temperature. The hot corrosion mechanisms of NdYbZr2O7 ceramic in various molten salts were discussed based on the phase diagram, Lewis acid-base rule and chemical thermodynamics. On this basis, the NdYbZr2O7 coating was prepared by atmospheric plasma spray (APS) and it exhibits a higher corrosion resistance compared to YSZ coating.","Wu, Yang;Bai, Zhiming;Zheng, Lei;He, Wenting;Guo, Hongbo",2020-05-31,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,NdYbZr2O7,Hot corrosion,APS",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.083,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.083
Comparison of hot corrosion behavior of nanostructured ScYSZ and YSZ thermal barrier coatings,"Hot corrosion behavior of nanostructured scandia (3.6mol%) and yttria (0.4mol%) stabilized zirconia (4ScYSZ) and yttria stabilized zirconia (4YSZ) were investigated. Thus, duplex TBCs (thermal barrier coatings), composed of a bond coat (NiCrAlY) and a top coat (4ScYSZ or 4YSZ), were deposited on the IN738LC Ni-based supperalloy by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS). Hot corrosion studies of plasma sprayed TBCs were conducted in 45wt% Na2SO4+55wt% V2O5 molten salt at 910°C for different times. Based on the results, it was revealed that ScYSZ coating has more hot corrosion resistance than YSZ coatings. Moreover, the mechanisms of degradation of both TBCs under corrosion salt were suggested.","Loghman-Estarki, M.R.;Shoja Razavi, R.;Edris, H.;Bakhshi, S.R.;Nejati, M.;Jamali, H.",2016-05-01,Ceramics International,"Nanostructured Thermal barrier coating,Hot corrosion,Atmospheric plasma spray,ScYSZ,YSZ",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.01.147,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.01.147
Residual stress distribution along interfaces in thermal barrier coating system under thermal cycles,"The residual interfacial stress plays an important role in crack initiating and propagating along the interface, which could result in delamination failure of the thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). In this study, the finite element model of air plasma spraying(APS) TBCs was established to assess the level and distribution of residual stress along top coat(TC)/thermally grown oxide (TGO) and bond coat (BC)/TGO interfaces under thermal cycles. Instead of using vertical stress S 22 in global coordinate system, the normal and tangential components in the local system along the interfaces, transformed from stress components S 11, S 22, and S 12 in the global one, were used to evaluate the way the cracks initiate and propagate along the interfaces. Firstly, the effect of the number of thermal cycles on residual stress was investigated. It was found that, for the TBCs model without TGO growth and crack, the impact of the number of thermal cycles on the stress is very insignificant and could be ignored. So the present study only chose to focus on the first thermal cycle. Then the influence of the TGO thickness and the interface amplitude on the normal and tangential residual stresses for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous temperature fields was explored. The results show that the TGO thickness, interface amplitude and temperature field affect the residual stress level and distribution, leading to different fracture mechanisms along TC/TGO and TGO/BC interfaces. Finally, the difference between the vertical stress in the global coordinate system and the normal stress in the local coordinate system was studied. Compared with vertical stress S 22, the stress components normal and tangential to the TC/TGO and TGO/BC interfaces are more appropriate to describing the stress distribution along the interfaces and predicting the propensity of crack initiating and propagating along the interfaces.","Yu, Q.M.;Cen, L.",2017-02-15,Ceramics International,"Finite element method,Thermal barrier coating,Residual stress,Thermal cycle",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.11.119,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.11.119
Thermal and mechanical performances of Nd2LaTaO7 oxide,"In the current study, a pure Nd2LaTaO7 compound with single weberite structure was synthesized and investigated. The analysis results indicated that the oxide exhibits favorable phase-stability up to 1473 K, and its coefficient of thermal expansion is greater than that of YSZ. Due to phonon scattering resulting from high-concentration oxygen vacancies, complicated crystal lattice structure, and differences in the ionic size and mass between the substituting atoms and Ta5+ ions, it exhibits relatively low thermal conductivity. Furthermore, its fracture toughness, Young's modulus, and Vickers hardness are lower than that of YSZ.","Shimin, Wang;Bin, Li;Debing, Sun;Hongsong, Zhang;Fei, Wang;Wenpeng, Mai;Qunpeng, Duan",2019-06-01,Ceramics International,"Rare-earth tantalate,Thermal-physical properties,Mechanical properties,Thermal barrier coatings",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.144,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.144
Tribological properties of titania nanofilms coated on glass surface by the sol–gel method,"Ce3+-doped and undoped TiO2 nanofilms with one, three, and five layers were prepared on glass surface by the sol–gel method. The thicknesses were about 40, 120 and 200nm. Atomic force microscopy analysis showed that many defects existed on uncoated glass substrate surface such as microcracks and microvoids, resulting in high surface roughness. After coating with the TiO2 nanofilms, the microdefects of the glass surface were filled and covered by film materials. With increased film layers and Ce3+ doping, the structure of the TiO2 nanofilms surface became more uniform and compact, and the surface roughness gradually decreased. Nanoindentation and friction wear tests on the samples surface revealed that the surface hardness and friction coefficient of uncoated glass substrate were about 6.8GPa and 0.37. After coating, the surface hardness of the samples increased and the friction coefficient remarkably decreased. Furthermore, with increased film thickness and Ce3+ doping, the friction coefficient of the sample gradually decreased and its wear-resisting property obviously increased. TiO2 nanofilms coated on the glass substrate surface can be used as protective layers of glass, exerting excellent anti-wear and friction reducing effects.","Ji, Guojun;Shi, Zhiming;Zhang, Wei;Zhao, Ge",2014-04-30,Ceramics International,"A.

Improving adhesive strength of WC-CoCr coating with novel bimodal roughening substrate: Finite element modeling,"The durability of a coating-substrate system is mainly determined by its adhesion strength. However, a major challenge is to effectively evaluate the adhesive effect after design, as measuring the adhesion strength of complex composite coatings is difficult. In this work, a bi-roughened surface of substrate was designed and its effects on the adhesive strength of WC-CoCr coatings were explored by simulation. Initially, a finite element model was established to simulate the substrate-coating system with bi-roughening (sub-roughness and sub-roughening angles) interface. In the case of monomodal Ra 7.5 μm, the adhesive strength was predicted to be only 68 MPa. While, the designed sub-roughening of Ra 0.8 μm enhanced the value to nearly 80 MPa. Moreover, the adhesive strength is further improved to above 100 MPa by tailoring the sub-roughening angle to 60°. The residual stresses along interfacial region decrease significantly for bi-roughening design, which can be responsible for enhanced adhesive strength. Additionally, individual crack growth occurs in almost every bi-roughening, and does not connect with the main crack, which result in a proportional increase in apparent interfacial shear strength. Briefly, adhesion strength is considerably improved for the bi-roughening design, which is beneficial for durability of the coatings during service.","Tahir, Adnan;Li, Guang-Rong;Wei, Zhi-Yuan;Liu, Mei-Jun;Yang, Guan-Jun;Li, Chang-Jiu",2020-06-01,Ceramics International,"Adhesive strength,Bimodal roughness,Durability,Interfacial crack,FEM,Residual stress",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.047,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.047
Influence of additives on microstructure and property of microarc oxidized Mg–Si–O coatings,"Ceramic coatings were fabricated on ZK60 magnesium alloy substrate by microarc oxidation (MAO) in Na2SiO3–KOH base electrolyte with four kinds of additives (i.e. KF, NH4HF2, C3H8O3 and H2O2). The effects of these additives on microstructure and property of coatings were investigated. The surface morphology, phase composition and corrosion resistance of the ceramic coatings were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and simulation body fluid (SBF) immersion test respectively. It is found that different additives can change the spark discharge phenomenon during microarc oxidation. It is proved that both potassium fluoride (KF) and ammonium bifluoride (NH4HF2) promote discharge and accelerate reaction while the introduce of glycerol (C3H8O3) leads to the refining of sparks and reduction of thermal effects. Results also demonstrate that the introduce of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) contributes to the increase of coating surface roughness and enlargement of surface micropore size. XRD results indicate that the ceramic coatings are mainly composed of Mg2SiO4, MgSiO3 and SiO2. The introduce of H2O2 hinders the reaction between SiO2 and MgO and creates favorable conditions for the formation of the MgO phase. The ceramic coatings formed in base electrolyte containing 7g/L NH4HF2 and 5mL/L C3H8O3 exhibit the highest corrosion resistance.","Pan, Y.K.;Chen, C.Z.;Wang, D.G.;Yu, X.;Lin, Z.Q.",2012-09-30,Ceramics International,"C.

Synthesis and biodegradation evaluation of nano-Si and nano-Si/TiO2 coatings on biodegradable Mg–Ca alloy in simulated body fluid,"In the present study, nano-Si and nano-Si/TiO2 composite coatings have been successfully synthesized on the surface of Mg–1wt%Ca alloy by the physical vapor deposition (PVD) method. The surface morphology and compositions of the coated specimens were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The results show the formation of thin and compact coating layers which homogeneously cover the surface of Mg alloy. Some micro-pores and micro-cracks were observed in the Si and Si/TiO2 films. It was also found that the Si and TiO2 nanoparticle had a spherical morphology with an average particle size of 30–40nm and 70–80nm, respectively. Electrochemical studies revealed that nano-Si/TiO2 coating offers a significant reduction in the corrosion rate (0.57mm/year) compared to the Si coated (0.91mm/year) and the uncoated alloys (6.21mm/year) in simulated body fluid (SBF). Hydrogen evolution studies showed a lower degradation rate of nano-Si/TiO2 (1.57ml/cm2/day) than that of nano-Si coated alloy (2.22ml/cm2/day). Immersion test showed that the nano-Si/TiO2 coating presented a greater nucleation site of hydroxyapatite (HA) than the uncoated sample. Thus nano-Si/TiO2 composite coating prepared by PVD on the Mg–Ca alloy is more appropriate for biomedical applications.","Bakhsheshi-Rad, H.R.;Hamzah, E.;Daroonparvar, M.;Kasiri-Asgarani, M.;Medraj, M.",2014-11-30,Ceramics International,"B.

A new precursor for fabricating TiN coating on 316L stainless steel at low temperature without corrosive byproducts,"High quality TiN coated 316L stainless steel can hardly be fabricated by the traditional chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods because of the formation of HCl (g) corrosive byproduct and phase transformation at high deposition temperature. To address the problem, herein, for the first time a novel TiCl2 precursor is proposed to fabricate TiN coating on 316L substrate in N2 atmosphere at low temperature. The idea is based on that metastable TiCl2 can release fresh Ti atoms by its disproportionation reaction, and then the fresh Ti atoms react easily with N2 to form TiN coating at low temperature without HCl byproduct. The reaction path, interface reaction, and performance of the TiN coating were investigated. The optimized nanograin TiN (45 nm) coating was successfully fabricated on 316L at 750 °C and it exhibited excellent corrosion resistance.","Song, Miao;Yang, Yafeng;Guo, Junjie;Xiang, Maoqiao;Zhu, Qingshan;Ge, Yu",2019-10-15,Ceramics International,"Chemical vapor deposition,Metastable precursor,Nanograin size,TiN coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.037,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.037
Hollow Zn2SnO4 boxes coated with N-doped carbon for advanced lithium-ion batteries,"Hollow Zn2SnO4@N–C composites were synthesized after the calcined process of precursor. The N-doped carbon coating layers, as a physical buffering matrix to reinforce the hollow structure, prevent interparticle agglomeration and improve the electronic conductivity of the electrodes. Compared with our previous studies, Zn2SnO4@N–C composites show an enhanced electrochemical performance (616mAhg−1 after 45 cycles) and high rate capability. With rational and delicate design, this kind of composites may be the potential anode materials for lithium-ion batteries.","Zhao, Yang;Huang, Ying;Wang, Qiufen;Wang, Ke;Zong, Meng;Wang, Lei;Sun, Xu",2014-01-31,Ceramics International,"Hollow boxes,N-doped carbon coating,Lithium-ion batteries,Electrochemical properties,Anode materials",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.07.147,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.07.147
Effect of Fe doping on the magnetic properties of PbPdO2 nanograin film fabricated by sol-gel method,"The single-phase Fe-doped PbPdO2 film was prepared using a sol-gel spin-coating method. The film had a nanograin structure consisting of compacted particles with an average crystallization size of about 35.2nm. Large amount of Pb vacancies were found in the film. The valences of the Pb, Pd and Fe ions of the film were confirmed to be near 2+, 2+ and 3+, respectively. The additional electron provided by Fe3+ and the high ionization energy of Fe3+ ensure the stability of the valence of doped Fe ions. The measurement of hysteresis loops and the theoretical fitting of the zero-field-cooled and field-cooled magnetization versus temperature curve indicated that the ferromagnetism and the paramagnetism coexist in the Fe-doped PbPdO2. And the ferromagnetism persisted up to 380K. A bound magnetic polaron model based on the Pb vacancies, the carriers and the doped Fe ions was utilized to account for the origin of the film's ferromagnetism. The isolated Fe ions or magnetic polarons were believed to be responsible for the paramagnetism in the film.","Liu, J.;Mei, C.;Chuang, P.Y.;Song, T.T.;Tang, F.L.;Su, H.L.;Huang, J.C.A.;Wu, Y.C.",2016-11-01,Ceramics International,"Fe-doped PbPdO2 film,Sol-gel spin-coating method,Magnetic properties,Bound magnetic polaron model",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.038,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.038
Preparation and characterisation of Fe/Fe3O4 fibres based soft magnetic composites,"Soft magnetic composites (FSMCs) have been prepared by using Fe fibres coated with a layer of Fe3O4, this layer playing the role of insulating material. The coating was made via blackening method by simply immersing the fibres in the blackening bath for 5, 10 and 15 min. The formation of the Fe3O4 coating on the surface of the fibres was confirmed by X-ray diffraction. The SEM investigation, used to evaluate the thickness of the coatings, has proved that increasing the coating duration leads to the increase of the coating thickness and complete coverage of the surface of the fibres. Differential scanning calorimetry and thermomagnetic measurements were used to investigate the thermal stability of the composite fibres. The fibres coated with Fe3O4 were compacted at a compaction pressure of 700 MPa to obtain toroidal magnetic cores. The obtained cores were characterised in DC and AC magnetisation regime. The analysis of the quasi-static hysteresis loops evidenced that increasing the thickness of the Fe3O4 leads to a slight deterioration of the compact's magnetic properties. However, as the thickness of the Fe3O4 layer increases, the development of eddy currents at a larger scale is hindered as proved by the AC magnetic investigations. A model for analytic separation of the core losses is proposed. By applying this model to the prepared samples, we are now able to discriminate between the occurring losses and adjust the preparation process of new samples to the targeted characteristics.","Neamţu, B.V.;Pszola, M.;Vermeşan, H.;Stoian, G.;Grigoraş, M.;Opriş, A.;Cotojman, L.;Marinca, T.F.;Lupu, N.;Chicinaş, I.",2020-08-20,Ceramics International,"Fibres based soft magnetic composites,Fe3O4 insulating layer,DC and AC magnetic Characterisation,Core loss separation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.165,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.165
Tension-tension fatigue behaviour of 3D braided SiCf/SiC composite with film cooling holes at 1350 °C in air,"The tension-tension fatigue behaviour of SiCf/SiC composites with film cooling holes (FCHs) was investigated at 1350 °C in air. The number of drilled holes were 1, 5, 10 (rectangular arrangement) and 11 (triangular arrangement), and the average diameter was 0.5 mm. The fatigue stresses were 80 MPa and 120 MPa at a frequency of 3.0 Hz, and the R ratio of minimum stress to maximum stress was 0.1. The stress-strain hysteresis curve, strain accumulation and modulus decrease were investigated, and characterization of the fracture morphology and microstructure was performed to reveal the initiation and evolution of damage during fatigue cycles. The results indicated that the FCHs exhibit little effect on the ultimate tensile strength of the composites. The fatigue life decreases with an increasing number of FCHs, and the effect of the FCHs on the fatigue life gradually decreases as stress levels increase. Specimens with triangular arrangement 11-H exhibit the worst fatigue life, and the damage mechanism is significant relative to large-area of fibre oxidation on the fracture surface. The weakening effect of FCHs on the fatigue performance of the composites is mainly due to the oxidation and embrittlement of fibres around the hole, and it is significant relative to initial crack nucleation and propagation in the coating and matrix.","Zhang, X.H.;Gao, H.S.;Wen, Z.X.;Li, M.Y.;Zhou, X.G.;Yue, Z.F.",2020-04-15,Ceramics International,"CMC,SiCf/SiC composite,Film cooling hole,Turbine blade,Three-dimensional four-step braided,Tension-tension fatigue",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.273,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.273
Effect of substrate temperature on microstructure and nanomechanical properties of Gd2Zr2O7 coatings prepared by EB-PVD technique,"In the present work, gadolinium zirconate (Gd2Zr2O7) coatings have been developed on Inconel-718 substrates by electron beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD) technique. The structural, morphological and mechanical properties as a function of substrate temperature have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), nanoindentation and scratch tests. XRD analysis revealed that the coatings showed cubic defect fluorite phase, and no secondary phase formation was observed in the coatings during deposition. The decrease in the lattice constant of the fluorite phase with increasing deposition temperature was explained on the basis of strain relaxation and vacancy concentration. Increased surface roughness of the coatings has been found with increasing substrate temperature as a result of increased crystallite size. An improved coating adhesion achieved for the coating deposited at higher substrate temperature of 973 K was confirmed by scratch test. Nanoindentation measurements indicated higher hardness (7.7 GPa) and resistance to plastic deformation and better capability to accommodate deformation energy for the coatings prepared at higher deposition temperature.","Jesuraj, S.

Colloidal stability of dextran and dextran/poly ethylene glycol coated TiO2 nanoparticles by hydrothermal assisted sol–gel method,"Colloidal stability of dextran (Dex) and Dex/poly ethylene glycol (PEG) coated TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) were investigated. The particles were successfully synthesized by a hydrothermal assisted sol–gel technique. The results of Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectrophotometry showed that Dex and PEG additions during hydrothermal process (HTP) led to the formation of long-term (more than 60 days) stable colloids, while the addition of dispersants after HTP did not have a significant impact on the colloidal stability of NPs. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) analyses proved that PEG and/or Dex coated NPs had less crystallinity than the plain TiO2. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy demonstrated the formation of primary bonds between NPs and polymeric dispersants. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) displayed stable particles with a core-shell structure resulting from coating of NPs by polymeric materials. Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) was also utilized to calculate the proportion of NPs to polymeric dispersant.","Naghibi, Sanaz;Madaah Hosseini, Hamid Reza;Faghihi Sani, Mohammad Ali",2013-09-30,Ceramics International,"TiO2 nanoparticle,PEG,Dextran,Hydrothermal assisted sol–gel,Colloidal stability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.04.018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.04.018
A rapid method for the preparation of silica-coated ZrO2 nanoparticles by microwave irradiation,"A novel synthesis of silica-coated ZrO2 nanoparticles is reported based on microwave irradiation (MW) method. The synthesis of silica-coated ZrO2 nanoparticles was realized by a rapid uniform hydrolysis and subsequent copolymerization of the precursor tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) on ZrO2 surface. One of the advantages of this MW irradiation method is the very short coating time and uniform heating in comparison to the conventional ones, allowing the synthesis of uniformly coated ZrO2 nanoparticles with silica. The XPS analysis revealed the shifts in binding energies for Zr 3d5/2 and Zr 3d3/2 peaks after coating confirming the formation of silica layer on the surface of ZrO2 nanoparticles. Characteristic silica peaks were observed in the FTIR spectra of coated nanoparticles. The shift in the isoelectric point measured by dynamic light scattering method was indicator of silica coverage of the ZrO2 surface. The coatings formed at 70°C were thin and uniform and extended up to 2nm from the ZrO2 surface as confirmed by the HR-TEM images.","Siddiquey, Iqbal Ahmed;Furusawa, Takeshi;Sato, Masahide;Bahadur, Newaz Mohammed;Uddin, Md.

Microstructure and interface-adhesion of thermally sprayed continuous gradient elastic modulus FeCrAl-ceramic coatings,"The bond strength between thermally sprayed metal bond-coats and ceramic top-coats is a key factor in determining their service life. However, most studies focus on interface modifications. In this research, based on FeCrAl bond-coats prepared by arc spraying, top-coats (Al2O3-40 wt% TiO2) were prepared by plasma spraying, and heat treatment was carried out in a hypoxic atmosphere. Continuous gradient elastic modulus FeCrAl-ceramic coatings were successfully prepared, and the microstructural and mechanical properties from the substrate to the top-coats were systematically investigated. The Al2O3 content gradually decreased from the top-coats to the substrate, forming continuous gradient elastic modulus FeCrAl-ceramic coatings. The oxide formed during the heat treatment filled the defects in the bond-coats and greatly improved the mechanical properties of the coating. The bonding strength of the continuous gradient elastic modulus coating was 21.7% greater than that of the as-received coating.","Li, Qiaolei;Deng, Chunming;Li, Lu;Lü, Jianguo;Song, Peng;Li, Chao;Wang, Mingjun;Wang, Chunjian;Zheng, Biju;Lu, Jiansheng",2020-04-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal spraying,Bonding strength,Elastic modulus,Hardness,Gradient coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.048,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.048
Comprehensive dynamic failure mechanism of thermal barrier coatings based on a novel crack propagation and TGO growth coupling model,"Comprehensive understanding of failure mechanism of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) is essential to develop the next generation advanced TBCs with longer lifetime. In this study, a novel numerical model coupling crack propagation and thermally grown oxide (TGO) growth is developed. The residual stresses induced in the top coat (TC) and in the TGO are calculated during thermal cycling. The stresses in the TC are used to calculate strain energy release rates (SERRs) for in-plane cracking above the valley of undulation. The overall dynamic failure process, including successive crack propagation, coalescence and spalling, is examined using extended finite element method (XFEM). The results show that the tensile stress in the TC increases continuously with an increase in an undulation amplitude. The SERRs for TC cracks accumulate with cycling, resulting in the propagation of crack toward the TC/TGO interface. The TGO cracks nucleate at the peak of the TGO/bond coat (BC) interface and propagate toward the flank region of the TC/TGO interface. Both TC cracks and TGO cracks successively propagate and finally linkup leading to coating spallation. The propagation and coalescence behavior of cracks predicted by this model are in accordance with the experiment observations. Therefore, this study proposed coating optimization methods towards advanced TBCs with prolonged thermal cyclic lifetime.","Wei, Zhi-Yuan;Cai, Hong-Neng;Li, Chang-Jiu",2018-12-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Thermally grown oxide (TGO) growth,Crack propagation,Failure mechanism,Thermal cycling",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.028,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.028
Preparation and structure control of a scalelike MoSi2-borosilicate glass coating with improved contact damage and thermal shock resistance,"The scalelike coatings with MoSi2 as emittance agent, flake fused quartz as coarse fillers, silica sol as dispersive medium of coating slurry, were prepared on rigid mullite fibrous ceramics to avoid fatal radial cracks and improve thermal shock resistance via combining slurry method with sol-gel method. And the particle size distribution of fused silica was changed to get different crack structure in scalelike coatings. Microstructure and phase composition of the coatings with different crack structure were investigated comprehensively. Contact damage resistance, thermal shock resistance and infrared radiating property were also studied. The results showed that only the coatings with mixing large and small particles of fused silica as coarse fillers could form crack network. The scalelike coatings with crack network went through 25 thermal cycles between 1500 °C and room temperature without peeling and spalling, and the bonding strength did not decrease after test. The scalelike structure with crack network also avoided radial cracks and exhibited some softness and less stiffness in Hertzian indentation test. The emissivity of coatings with different crack structure were all higher than 0.85; and the coatings with lower proportion of crack areas had higher emissivity.","Wu, Jinyu;Xu, Xiaojing;Xiong, Yanli;Guan, Xingyu;Jiao, Mengyu;Yao, Xinghe;Hu, Xiaoxia;Xu, Shunyi;Tao, Xin;Du, Haiyan",2020-04-15,Ceramics International,"Scalelike MoSi2-Glass coating,Slurry and sol-gel process,Crack structure,Mechanical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.212,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.212
Effects of laser surface remelting on the molten salt corrosion resistance of yttria-stabilized zirconia coatings,"In the present study, atmospheric plasma-sprayed yttria-stabilized zirconia coatings were post-remelted by a continuous diode laser to improve the hot corrosion resistance for as-sprayed coatings. The coating surfaces were covered with a salt mixture (V2O5 and Na2SO4) and then subjected to a hot corrosion test at 1100 °C in air. The influence of laser parameters including power and scanning rate on the coating microstructure and corrosion resistance was investigated. Results showed that the hot corrosion resistance can be improved by producing a dense and smooth surface and reducing the coating permeability to the molten salt. The transformation of the hot corrosion mechanisms was clarified on the basis of the observed corrosion behaviors. A laser power of 1500 W and scanning rate of 9 mm/s can produce minimal surface roughness with few segmented cracks, which can provide improved performance of the hot corrosion resistance.","Yi, Peng;Mostaghimi, Javad;Pershin, Larry;Xu, Pengyun;Zhan, Xianghua;Jia, Delong;Yi, Hao;Liu, Yancong",2018-12-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,Yttria-stabilized zirconia,Laser remelting,Molten salt corrosion resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.041,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.041
The oxidation behavior of MoSi2-CrSi2-Si/SiC coating for C/C composites in H2O-O2-Ar atmosphere: Experiment and first-principle investigation,"The MoSi2-CrSi2-Si/SiC multi-component coating was prepared by two-step pack cementation on carbon/carbon composites. To investigate the effect of water vapor on the anti-oxidation of the coated samples, two kinds of atmosphere (50%H2O-50%O2, 50%O2-50%Ar) were designed for comparison with a total pressure of 1atm at 1773K. The results showed that, after being tested for 10h, the weight loss of the coated samples in O2+Ar and H2O+O2 were 0.243% and 0.436% respectively. The reasons for different weight losses can be attributed to the water vapor, which could degrade the protective ability of the glass layer formed by SiO2 and Cr2O3 and thereby accelerate the oxidation of MoSi2 and CrSi2. Based on the Mulliken analysis calculated by the first principle, the corresponding water vapor corrosion resistance of the prepared coating was in the following order: SiC>MoSi2>CrSi2, which was consistent with the experimental phenomenon.","Guo, Liping;Fu, Qiangang;Sun, Jia;Cheng, Chunyu",2017-08-15,Ceramics International,"Ceramic matrix composites,Weight loss,High temperature corrosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.020,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.020
Effect of processing variables on the photocatalytic properties of ZnO thin films prepared using the polymeric precursor method,"The preparation of ZnO thin films using the polymeric precursor method is reported, and the influence of the thickness and calcination temperature on their effective photocatalytic activity was analyzed. The ZnO thin films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectroscopy (UV-DRS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Thicker films with a lower calcination temperature exhibited better photoactivity for RhB photodegradation under UV irradiation. The average particle size increased from 14 to 45nm as the calcination temperature increased from 400 to 600°C. In addition, the stability results indicated no significant deactivation even after four successive re-uses in RhB photodegradation.","Carvalho, Kele T.G.;Fidelis, Suzane C.;Lopes, Osmando F.;Ribeiro, Caue",2015-11-30,Ceramics International,"Zinc oxide,Spin-coating,Rhodamine B,Water decontamination",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.04.155,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.04.155
"Improvement on the phase stability, mechanical properties and thermal insulation of Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 by Gd2O3 and Yb2O3 co-doping","Gd2O3 and Yb2O3 co-doped 3.5mol% Y2O3–ZrO2 and conventional 3.5mol% Y2O3–ZrO2 (YSZ) powders were synthesized by solid state reaction. The objective of this study was to improve the phase stability, mechanical properties and thermal insulation of YSZ. After heat treatment at 1500°C for 10h, 1mol% Gd2O3–1mol% Yb2O3 co-doped YSZ (1Gd1Yb-YSZ) had higher resistance to destabilization of metastable tetragonal phase than YSZ. The hardness of 5mol% Gd2O3–1mol% Yb2O3 co-doped YSZ (5Gd1Yb-YSZ) was higher than that of YSZ. Compared with YSZ, 1Gd1Yb-YSZ and 5Gd1Yb-YSZ exhibited lower thermal conductivity and shorter phonon mean free path. At 1300°C, the thermal conductivity of 5Gd1Yb-YSZ was 1.23W/mK, nearly 25% lower than that of YSZ (1.62W/mK).

The effect of a buffer layer on the structure and the performance of cutting-tools for ZrWN films that are deposited using DCMS and HIPIMS,"This paper determines the optimal settings for the deposition of ZrWN nitride films using reactive direct current magnetron sputtering (DCMS) and high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HIPIMS), with pure Zr and W metal targets and Ar plasma and N2 reactive gases. The materials tested as buffer layers are metal tungsten (W) and tungsten nitride (WN) thin films. Using a Taguchi method, this study determines the effect of deposition parameters for the buffer layer (W DC power, substrate bias, N2/(N2+Ar) flow rate and substrate temperature) on the structural and mechanical properties, and the dry machining performance of cutting-tools for multilayer ZrWN/W and ZrWN/WN/substrates. In the confirmation runs using grey Taguchi analysis, there is an improvement of 32.31% and 13.38% in surface roughness and flank wear, respectively. The films are characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (FEI-TEM) and a nanoindenter. The TEM pattern for the ZrWN films shown corresponds to the (111), (200) and (220) planes of the face-center-cubic phase. Pretreatment of a tungsten carbide tool uses oxygen plasma etching to enhance the adhesion of the multilayer ZrWN/WN coating. Compared with coatings that are deposited using DCMS, the samples that are deposited using HIPIMS exhibit a higher film density and a smoother surface. In the HIPIMS mode, the XRD diffraction peaks of the films are sharper and more intense, which indicates an improvement in crystallinity.","Chang, Kai-Sheng;Kao, Jin-Yih;Huang, Chia-Ho;Hsu, Chun-Yao;Hong, Po-Da",2018-06-01,Ceramics International,"Multilayer,Grey Taguchi method,HIPIMS,Cutting-tools performance,Oxygen plasma etching",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.171,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.171
Design of core-shell structured YSZ@Cu cermet powders with thermal conductivity anisotropy by electroless deposition,"Core-shell structured cermet powders with thermal conductivity anisotropy have been brought into focus because they have a great potential application as the horizontal thermal diffusion layer material in multilayer thermal protective coating (TPC). In this contribution, core-shell structured YSZ@Cu cermet powders were fabricated by electroless deposition (ED) of Cu on yttria-stabilised zirconia (YSZ) powder. The surface of YSZ powder was uniformly coated with a thin Cu shell of approximately 2 μm. Through X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) analysis, it was found that trace CuO and Cu2O oxides formed on the surface of Cu shell. Results of thermal spraying adaptability analysis show the flowability of core-shell structured YSZ@Cu cermet powder improved to 56.8 s/50 g, which conforms better to the basic requirements of thermal spraying material. By differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) tests, the YSZ@Cu powder had good thermal stability. In particular, between 25 and 500 °C, the anisotropy thermal conductivity rose higher than 1.8 and it remained stable at approximately 1.6 with temperature as high as 900 °C. All these features promise it a high-performance thermal conductivity anisotropy material.","Zhang, Nan;Li, Qingkui;Yang, Kaijun;Wang, Hailong;Zhu, Jinpeng;Ma, Zhuang;Gao, Lihong;Liu, Yanbo;Liu, Yang;He, Jilin",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"YSZ@Cu cermet,Core-shell structure,Anisotropic thermal conductivity,Electroless deposition",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.201,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.201
In vitro evaluation of Ag doped hydroxyapatite coatings in acellular media,"The goal of the present contribution is to show what is the effect of Ag addition on in vitro bioactivity and degradation characteristics of hydroxyapatite (HAP) in simulated body fluid (SBF), Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and phosphate buffer solution (PBS) over a period of immersion at 37 ± 0.5 °C ranged from 1 to 21 days. Also, the corrosion investigations in all three media were carried out at 37 ± 0.5 °C. The results showed that the coatings behaviour is modulated with respect to the testing media and indicated that the Ag addition into hydroxyapatite has enhanced the general behaviour of HAP by either preventing and/or reducing dissolution of the HAP in SBF and DMEM solutions, while in PBS media the Ag addition contributed to a very slow degradation of hydroxyapatite. Thus, it can be said that the Ag addition into HAP enhances the overall chemical stability and behaviour in acellular media.","Vranceanu, Diana M.;Parau, Anca C.;Cotrut, Cosmin M.;Kiss, Adrian E.;Constantin, Lidia R.;Braic, Viorel;Vladescu, Alina",2019-06-01,Ceramics International,"Films,Electron microscopy,Interfaces,X-ray method,Corrosion,Apatite,Biomedical applications",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.191,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.191
Hydroxyapatite–Titania nanotube composite as a coating layer on Co–Cr-based implants: Mechanical and electrochemical optimization,"Inadequate mechanical properties of pure hydroxyapatite (HA) coating layers make it an unsuitable candidate for many load-bearing orthopedic implants. In this study, Titania nanotubes (TNT) and HA were synthesized using Rapid Breakdown Adonization (RBA) and sol–gel methods, respectively. The sintering process at different temperatures was then conducted for the phase transformation of titanium. HA–TNT mixtures in different quantities and phases were prepared for coating on Co–Cr-based substrates. To optimize the coated HA–TNT composite layer in term of hardness, bonding strength and corrosion potential, empirical models based on Response Surface Methodology (RSM) were developed. The synthesized TNT and HA–TNT coated samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The predicted models generated by RSM were compared with the experimental results, and close agreement was observed. While the models demonstrate that TNT quantity is a more significant factor than sintering temperature in improving hardness (H), bonding strength (P) and the corrosion potential (E corr) of a coated substrate, sintering temperature still has a considerable effect on H and E corr. The optimum HA–TNT composite coating layer in terms of the mechanical and electrochemical properties were obtained with a TNT ratio of 1.07(wt%) at a sintering temperature of 669.11°C.","Rezazadeh Shirdar, Mostafa;Taheri, Mohammad Mahdi;Moradifard, Hossein;Keyvanfar, Ali;Shafaghat, Arezou;Shokuhfar, Tolou;Izman, Sudin",2016-05-01,Ceramics International,"Hydroxyapatite–Titania nanotube composite,Co–Cr-based implant,Mechanical and electrochemical properties,Response surface methodology",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.01.080,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.01.080
Modification of electrophoretic deposition of chitosan–bioactive glass–hydroxyapatite nanocomposite coatings for orthopedic applications by changing voltage and deposition time,"This article presents electrophoretic depositions of chitosan (CS), bioactive glass (BG), and hydroxyapatite (HA) applied on titanium (Ti) substrate from ethanol-based suspension. The strategy was utilized to modify the deposition of particles with different values of sizes and Zeta potentials, and consequently obtain desirable nanocomposite coating. SEM studies showed that uniform distribution of particles was obtained on isolated substrate at pH 4.5. Moreover, modified deposition of BG microparticles (<37µm) and HA nanoparticles (<150nm) in chitosan matrix was reached by changing voltage and deposition time. The results of X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed a composite with high content of HA was fabricated at pH 4.5, V=20V, and t=15min. The deposition mechanism at the initial and final times was significantly related to self-assembly of HA nanoparticles that chelated by cationic macromolecular chains and located on BG microparticles, and CS-coated particulates of HA nanoparticles, respectively. The results of potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies demonstrated that the CS–BG–HA composite coating acts as a barrier layer in corrected simulated body fluid (C-SBF).","Molaei, A.;Yari, M.;Afshar, M.

On the micrometre precise mould filling of liquid polymer derived ceramic precursor for 300-µm-thick high aspect ratio ceramic MEMS,"This paper describes a novel and scalable method for the fabrication of polymer derived ceramics (PDC) structures with high aspect ratio and micrometre scale features. Elastomeric micro-moulds composed of a filling pot are used to deliver via sacrificial micro-channels a precise amount of the liquid ceramic precursor to the target location with the micro-scale functional structures. To improve the filling properties of the mould and to ease the de-moulding of the fragile green body parts, we investigated various channel and mould coating materials, such as carbon and Teflon®-like C4F8. The coating properties were characterised by measuring the contact angle and the advancing speed of the PDC inside micro-channels. We found that, the C4F8 Teflon®-like coating yields the best de-moulding results for high aspect ratio moulds, whereas the carbon coating yields a two-fold increase in filling speed compared to bare PDMS. The fabricated samples and their side-wall properties were characterised in detail by means of optical and scanning electron microscopy. We present process parameters for well-defined ceramic samples containing micrometric features fabricated with this new approach opening the use of this outstanding material for new MEMS applications where resistance to harsh environment such as mechanical wear, high temperatures or corrosion is required. The presented fabrication method has the potential to be scalable up to cost-efficient mass production.","Grossenbacher, Jonas;Gullo, Maurizio R.;Bakumov, Vadym;Blugan, Gurdial;Kuebler, Jakob;Brugger, Juergen",2015-01-31,Ceramics International,"Polymer derived ceramic,Micro-moulding,Capillary filling,Wetting angle",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.08.112,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.08.112
Deposition and characterization of nanocrystalline and amorphous Ni–W coatings with embedded alumina nanoparticles,"Nanocrystalline and amorphous Ni–W coatings containing Al2O3 nanoparticles were electrodeposited from three different ammoniacal citrate baths by direct current (DC) method. The effects of nanoparticles on compositional, structural and morphological features of Ni–W coatings were investigated. The effects of bath chemical composition and current density on codeposition behavior of nanoparticles were also studied. Guglielmi model for particle deposition was applied to identify the kinetics of particle deposition. The presence of nanoparticles may affect on coating grain size, tungsten content and the rate of metal deposition. In addition, nanoparticles can result in more compact coatings with fewer defects. The extent of these effects depends on bath chemical composition and may be influenced by the synergistic effect of Ni on deposition of W. It was also found that the kinetics of particle deposition and the effect of current density on codeposition behavior of nanoparticles are highly dependent on bath chemical composition.","Yari, Saeed;Dehghanian, Changiz",2013-09-30,Ceramics International,"B.

"Evaluation of hot corrosion behavior of CSZ, CSZ/micro Al2O3 and CSZ/nano Al2O3 plasma sprayed thermal barrier coatings","Hot corrosion is one of the main destructive factors in thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) which come as a result of molten salt effect on the coating–gas interface. Hot corrosion behavior of three types of plasma sprayed TBCs was evaluated: usual CSZ, layer composite of CSZ/Micro Al2O3 and layer composite of CSZ/Nano Al2O3 in which Al2O3 was as a topcoat on CSZ layer. Hot corrosion studies of plasma sprayed thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) were conducted in 45wt% Na2SO4+55wt% V2O5 molten salt at 1050°C for 40h. The graded microstructure of the coatings was examined using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffractometer (XRD) before and after hot corrosion test. The results showed that no damage and hot corrosion products was found on the surface of CSZ/Nano Al2O3 coating and monoclinic ZrO2 fraction was lower in CSZ/Micro Al2O3 coating in comparison with usual CSZ. reaction of molten salts with stabilizers of zirconia (Y2O3 and CeO2) that accompanied by formation of monoclinic zirconia, irregular shape crystals of YVO4, CeVO4 and semi-cubic crystals of CeO2 as hot corrosion products, caused the degradation of CSZ coating in usual CSZ and CSZ/Micro Al2O3 coating.","Nejati, M.;Rahimipour, M.R.;Mobasherpour, I.",2014-04-30,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,Hot corrosion,Plasma spray,CSZ/Al2O3 composite",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.08.135,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.08.135
Preparation of alumina based tubular asymmetric membranes incorporated with coal fly ash by centrifugal casting,"Design of new efficient membranes from sustainable sources such as coal fly ash (CFA) has been receiving rapidly growing attention. In the present work, alumina-based tubular asymmetric membranes were incorporated with different amounts of CFA using the centrifugal casting technique. The amount of CFA added to the matrix of the alumina tubes was varied from 10 to 40 wt% on a dry weight basis. The development of the ceramic membranes containing CFA comprised the following steps: raw materials dispersion, membrane preparation by centrifugal casting using high-speed mold rotation, drying of the green body followed by sintering at 1200 °C. The techniques used for membrane characterization included measuring mechanical strength, apparent porosity, morphology by scanning electron microscopy, linear shrinkage, hydraulic performance, and cornstarch retention. High CFA fraction in the alumina-based membranes resulted in higher porosity and higher water permeability, accompanied by a decrease in mechanical strength and linear shrinkage. The observed permeate flux was between 116 and 370 L m−2 h−1 bar−1, and the observed retention was above 99% for all the membranes tested. The addition of CFA for the preparation of asymmetric tubular membranes based on alumina allows utilization of industrial waste, reduces the cost and is interesting from both an economic and environmental points of view. These membranes have the potential for applications such as wastewater treatment and as a support for selective layer coatings.","de la Rocha, Melissa R.;Virginie, Mirella;Khodakov, Andrei;Pollo, Liliane D.;Marcílio, Nilson R.;Tessaro, Isabel C.",2020-10-07,Ceramics International,"(A) centrifugal casting,(E) membranes,(D) alumina,(D) CFA",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.296,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.296

We used X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and field-emission transmission electron microscopy to explore the structural, morphological, chemical, and microstructural features, respectively, of these films as a function of the growth condition (strontium doping concentrations varied from 1, 3, and 5mol%). The PZT thin film processed at the 3mol% Sr exhibited the best electrical characteristics, including a low leakage current of 2.27×10−7 A/cm2 at an electric field of 50kV/cm, a large capacitance value of 2.74μF/cm2 at a frequency of 10kHz, and a high remanent polarization of 37.95μC/cm2 at a frequency of 5kHz. We attribute this behavior to the optimal amount of strontium in the PZT film forming a perovskite structure and a thicker interfacial layer at the PSZT film-RuO2 electrode interface.","Prasad Bag, Sankar;Her, Jim-Long;Pan, Tung-Ming",2017-09-30,Ceramics International,"Electrical properties,Lead zirconate titanate (PZT),Sol-gel,Structure,Thin films",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.160,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.160
Unraveling the mechanical and tribological properties of a novel Ti5Si3/TiC nanocomposite coating synthesized by a double glow discharge plasma technique,"A novel Ti5Si3/TiC nanocomposite coating has been successfully prepared on a Ti–6Al–4V substrate by a double cathode glow discharge technique to address its poor tribological properties. The microstructural features of the Ti5Si3/TiC nanocomposite coating were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The nanocomposite coating consisted of cauliflower-like Ti5Si3 grains with an average grain size of ~15nm and TiC nanoparticles having an average grain size of ~15nm distributed at its boundaries. The mechanical and tribological properties of the Ti5Si3/TiC nanocomposite coating were compared with those of a monolithic Ti5Si3 nanocrystalline coating. The results clearly showed that the Ti5Si3/TiC nanocomposite coating exhibited a unique combination of higher fracture toughness and hardness as compared to the monolithic Ti5Si3 nanocrystalline coating, which thus exerted a positive effect on its wear resistance.","Xu, Jiang;Liu, Linlin;Jiang, Lei;Munroe, Paul;Xie, Zong-Han",2013-12-31,Ceramics International,"C.

"Microstructural characteristic, outward-inward growth behavior and formation mechanism of MAO ceramic coating on the surface of ADC12 Al alloy with micro-groove","The ceramic coatings on the surface of aluminum alloy substrates with micro-grooves have been successfully fabricated in the silicate solution via micro-arc oxidation (MAO) approach. Microstructure characterization showed that the larger main discharge channels were located in the center of micro-groove, the smaller secondary discharge channels were located on both sides of main discharge channel; and a few irregular micro-pores existed in the vicinity of all discharge channels, which were mainly cause by the rapid cooling and solidification of discharge channels hindering the removal of gases produced via reaction. Moreover, the growing direction of coating in the initial stage was mainly outward-growth and resulted in the formation of inverted triangle coating structure, which was due to the sharp-angled effect. But in the final growing stage, the inward-growth behavior played a key role owing to the spark transfer. According to above results and discussion, the formation of smooth, uniform and homogeneous ceramic coating on the surface of whole trapezoidal micro-groove substrate contained four stages: anodic oxidation growth, sharp corner rapid growth, coating homogenization and groove self-filling.","Wang, Jian;Huang, Shuai;He, Mingyang;Wangyang, Peihua;Lu, Yangfan;Huang, Hongjian;Xu, Lei",2018-05-31,Ceramics International,"Micro-groove,Ceramic coating,Outward-inward growth behavior,Formation mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.189,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.189
Ti-based nanocoatings on Al2O3 powders,"Ti-based nanocoatings on ceramic powders were successfully fabricated by heterogeneous precipitation method. Commercial Al2O3 (average particle size of 0.5μm), titanium tetrabutoxide (Ti(C4H9O)4) and urea (CO(NH2)2) have been used as starting materials. Selecting appropriate precipitation conditions, both the thickness and the uniformity of Ti-based nanocoatings were adjusted. With a molar ratio TiO2/Al2O3 =0.05 and the use of urea in excess, a homogeneous nanocoating of ∼20nm on the alumina powder surface was attained.

Laser glazing of plasma-sprayed nanostructured yttria stabilized zirconia thermal barrier coatings,"Nanostructured thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) consisting of yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) ceramic top coat and NiCrAlY metallic bond coat were prepared by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS). The Nd:YAG pulsed laser was used for laser treatment of top coat surface. The microstructure and thermal insulation capability of plasma-sprayed and laser-glazed thermal barrier coatings were investigated. The microstructure and phase composition of the coating were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray diffractometry (XRD). The nanostructured plasma-sprayed coating contained non-melted or partially melted nanosized particles and columnar grains, whereas the microstructure of laser-glazed coating consisted of columnar grains in the fracture surface and equiaxed grains on the surface. Laser glazing, which helps to eliminate the surface porosities and other structural defects of coatings deposited by the plasma spraying method, should contribute to the improvement of their surface roughness. XRD results revealed that both as-sprayed and laser-glazed coatings consisted of non-transformable tetragonal (T′) phase. The results of the thermal insulation capability test indicated that the thermal insulation capability of the laser-glazed coating, as compared to the as-sprayed coating, was slightly lower due to the microstructural change in the glazed layer of top coat.","Ghasemi, Reza;Shoja-Razavi, Reza;Mozafarinia, Reza;Jamali, Hossein",2013-12-31,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,Microstructure,Laser glazing,Atmospheric plasma spraying.",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.05.066,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.05.066
Tribological performance of Yttrium (III) and Zirconium (IV) ceramics reinforced WC–10Co4Cr cermet powder HVOF thermally sprayed on X2CrNiMo-17-12-2 steel,"In this paper, an experimental study has been performed on failure analysis of cermet coatings thermally sprayed on X2CrNiMo-17-12-2 stainless steel using a high-velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) technique. A comparative study was carried out to investigate the microstructural, mechanical and tribological properties of pure and ceramic-reinforced WC–10Co4Cr cermet coatings. Two different feedstocks i.e. Yttrium-III (Yttria) and Zirconium-IV (Zirconia) were used to develop two different ceramic-reinforced WC–10Co4Cr powders. Tribological properties were tested with the help of laboratory scale pot tester. Coal ashes (i.e., fly ash and bottom ash) were used as the erodents. Different parameters like velocity, time, concentration of particles, and impact angle were varied during the tribological experiments. The microstructural analysis reveals the interlocked lamellae splats, pores and unmelted particles on the as-sprayed surfaces. Yttria reinforced WC–10Co4Cr coating exhibit superior tribo-resistance and mechanical properties. The zirconia reinforced WC–10Co4Cr coating has shown good wear resistance in fly ash slurry which possesses a weak acidic nature (pH = 6.32–6.09 for concentration range of 30–60 wt%). Microhardness of WC–10Co4Cr cermet was also improved with the addition of Yttria. The erosion mechanisms were analyzed by using backscattered X-ray scanning electron microscope (SEM), interactive 3D surface plots, and 2D pseudo-images.","Singh, Jashanpreet;Kumar, Satish;Mohapatra, S.K.",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Slurry erosion,Stainless steel 316L,Cermet coating,Yttria,Zirconia,HVOF thermal spraying",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.007
Self-growth of nanocrystalline structures for amorphous Sr0.925Bi0.05TiO3 thin films with high energy density,"Process of self-growth nanocrystalline structure was explored to improve the dielectric properties of amorphous Sr0.925Bi0.05TiO3 (SBT) thin films through controlling the annealing temperature. The crystallinity of the material was 15% when annealed at 550 °C, and the resulting nanocrystalline particles were 14 nm in size as determined by XRD analysis. Therefore, the proposed process could produce a novel film of an amorphous matrix coating nanocrystalline particles. Finite element analysis results showed that the applied electric field was focused primarily in the amorphous matrix, which could effectively decrease the probability of low voltage breakdown of the nanocrystalline particles. Simultaneously, the nanocrystalline particles supplied more polarization charges, which helped to improve the dielectric constant of the inorganic composite. Combining the merits of amorphous and crystalline phases, the ultimate energy storage density of the modified sample was as high as 21.2 J/cm3, which represents an improvement of 5.1 J/cm3 compared with that of pure amorphous SBT thin film.","Li, Qiuxia;Gao, Wenbin;Su, Zhen;Yao, Manwen;Yao, Xi",2018-10-15,Ceramics International,"Sr0.925Bi0.05TiO3 thin films,Nanocrystalline,Breakdown strength,Dielectric constant,Energy storage",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.233,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.233

The synthesis of Bi2Te3 with rhombohedral structure is confirmed via X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis. Fourier transform infrared analysis (FTIR) demonstrates the presence of tannic acid on the surface of Bi2Te3 nanoflakes.

Gradient stiffening induced interfacial cracking and strain tolerant design in thermal barrier coatings,"Strain tolerant structures endow thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) with exceptional capability to bear various strains generated during service. However, the strain tolerance of TBCs inevitably degrades when stiffening occurs at high temperatures. Herein, we tailored a strain tolerant structure to resist degradation based on an understanding of the unique stiffening behavior and consequent failure mechanism of TBCs. The degree of gradient stiffening across the thickness of TBCs is caused by temperature-dependent sintering kinetics of ceramic coatings. As a result, vertical and in-plane cracks are formed in a scale-progressive way. Simulation results reveal that the differential degree of stiffening is a main cause of interfacial cracking. Subsequently, we proposed a strain tolerant structure that is tailored by lowering the stiffening rate of regions exposed to higher temperatures. Due to the weakened differential stiffening effect, the driving force that extends the interfacial cracks was significantly lowered. Thus, this strain tolerant TBC is expected to be able to resist degradation caused by sintering. These results will guide advanced design of TBCs for future applications.","Wang, Li-Shuang;Wei, Zhi-Yuan;Cheng, Bo;Liu, Mei-Jun;Li, Guang-Rong;Dong, Hui;Yang, Guan-Jun",2020-02-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Strain tolerant structure,Gradient stiffening,Anti-degradation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.226,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.226
Role of defect states on nonlinear properties of 8 MeV electrons irradiated zinc oxide thin films under off-resonant regime,"In the present work, ZnO thin films were synthesized by sol-gel with subsequent spin coating on corning glass substrates. To understand the variations in the structural, optical, and nonlinear optical properties of ZnO thin films, 8 MeV electron irradiation with different dose rates (0 kGy, 1 kGy, 5 kGy, and 10 kGy) was performed. The XRD spectra showed transition from polar crystal growth orientation to non-polar crystal growth orientation of the films when the irradiation dose rate was increased from 0 kGy to 10 kGy and this was attributed to the reduced thickness of the irradiated films. The generation of localized surface states below the conduction band upon electron irradiation was confirmed by the quantification of the Urbach energy. A large band gap shrinkage was observed in the irradiated films (3.31–3.10 eV) due to the enhanced surface states. The photoluminescence spectra showed reduction in the NBE emission due to the enhanced surface states in the irradiated films. Open aperture and closed aperture Z-scan measurements were performed to extract the nonlinear absorption coefficient (β) and nonlinear refractive index (n2) values using 532 nm Nd:YAG laser having pulse width of 7 ns. The open aperture Z-scan profiles of the films showed the presence of normalized transmittance valley, which was attributed to the two photon absorption (TPA) behaviour. The reduction in the depth of the normalized transmittance valley in irradiated films was ascribed to the bleaching of carriers in the ground states due to their trapping in the defect states. The closed aperture Z-scan curves showed the presence of normalized pre-focal peak, followed by a valley, which is characteristic of the self-defocusing nonlinear refraction behaviour. The electron irradiation with different dose rates provided an opportunity to understand the variations in the optoelectronic properties of the ZnO thin films considering the various defect states generated upon irradiation.","Sandeep, K.M.;Bhat, Shreesha;Dharmaprakash, S.M.",2018-06-01,Ceramics International,"8 MeV electron irradiation,ZnO thin films,Sol-gel spin coating,Localized defects,Two photon absorption,Figure of merit",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.112,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.112
High voltage resistance ceramic coating fabricated on titanium alloy for insulation shielding application,"To endow the insulation shielding of electromechanical devices, a TiO2 based ceramic coating with high voltage resistance was fabricated on titanium alloy by plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO). The effects of PEO coatings with different phase composition and microstructure on insulation performance were determined. The results show that the ceramic coating formed in the silicate-based solution was mainly composed of rutile, anatase TiO2 and Al2TiO5. As the coating thickens from 10 to 36 µm, the increasing cross-sectional porosity enables the dielectric strength decrease from 32.94 ± 2.1 V/μm to 11.9 ± 0.71 V/μm and the electric resistivity drop from 1.17 × 108 Ω cm to 0.99 × 108 Ω cm respectively. With 2 g/L KOH added into the basic electrolyte, the thickness of coating significantly increased to 50.0 ± 2.1 µm, accompanied by the enhanced crystalline degree of rutile TiO2 phase and the decreasing of internal defects. In this way, the optimum coating with preferable resistivity of 1.08 × 1010 Ω cm, high breakdown voltage of 617.78 ± 26.31 V and dielectric strength of 12.36 ± 0.53 V/μm was achieved.","Wang, Shuqi;Wang, Yaming;Cui, Yi;Zou, Yongchun;Wu, Yunfeng;Chen, Guoliang;Jia, Dechang;Zhou, Yu",2019-02-01,Ceramics International,"Ceramic coating,Plasma electrolytic oxidation,High voltage resistance,Insulating property",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.083,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.083
Ablation resistance of HfC–SiC coating prepared by supersonic atmospheric plasma spraying for SiC-coated C/C composites,"In order to improve the ablation properties of carbon/carbon composites, HfC–SiC coating was deposited on the surface of SiC-coated C/C composites by supersonic atmospheric plasma spraying. The morphology and microstructure of HfC–SiC coating were characterized by SEM and XRD. The ablation resistance test was carried out by oxyacetylene torch. The results show that the structure of coating is dense and the as-prepared HfC–SiC coating can protect the C/C composites against ablation. After ablation for 30s, the linear ablation rate and mass ablation rate of the coating are −0.44μm/s and 0.18mg/s, respectively. In the ablation center region, a Hf–Si–O compound oxide layer is generated on the surface of HfC–SiC coating, which is conducive to protecting the C/C composites from ablation. With the ablation time increasing to 60s, the linear ablation rate and mass ablation rate are changed to −0.38μm/s and 0.26mg/s, respectively.

The effect of foam's porosity and hydroxyapatite coating was investigated in uniaxial compression tests. The results show that the coating magnifies the pressure strength of the structure about five times and enhances its mechanical properties. The uniaxial compression test was simulated in a finite element package in which the porous structure was modeled by crushable foam material model. The results of simulation demonstrate a reasonable correspondence with the experimental data. The results also show that crushable foam material is a good candidate for modeling mechanical behavior of barium titanate foams under compression.,"Zarkoob, Hoda;Ziaei-Rad, Saeed;Fathi, Mohammadhossein;Dadkhah, Hossein",2012-05-31,Ceramics International,"Mechanical properties,Barium titanate foam,Hydroxyapatite coating,Finite element modeling",10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.12.057,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.12.057
Improved bio-physical performance of hydroxyapatite coatings obtained by electrophoretic deposition at dynamic voltage,"This study investigates the effects of the electrophoretic deposition process (EPD) at dynamic voltage on the physical and biological characteristics of hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings. HA powder is synthesized and used for preparation of HA/ethanol suspension which is subsequently characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), zeta potential and particle size analyses. Samples are prepared from commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti) substrates and coated with HA using EPD at dynamic voltage that keeps a constant depositional rate by adjusting the current and electrical field during the process. The HA-coated samples are dried and sintered at 800°C for 2h to densify the coatings. The XRD, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), EDS and adhesion tests are used to characterize the coated samples. The cross-sectional SEM images indicate that the thickness of coatings enhances as the current increases from 0.07 to 0.35mA. The coatings are more uniform, packed and non-cracked at lower currents while HA particles start to arrange in a highly porous structure and show non-uniform, cracked and non-stable coatings as the current increases. The results also demonstrate that the best adhesions for the coatings are obtained at lower currents of 0.07 and 0.15mA. Morphological studies and cell biological experiments are conducted using MG63 cells cultured on the HA-coated sample with the best overall physical performance. The number of attached and proliferated cells on the selected HA-coated sample is higher than on the non-coated titanium sample and culture plate used as control. There are significantly higher ALP activity and better cytoskeleton organization of cells on the HA-coated sample. This study shows that the EPD process at dynamic voltage can influence the structure and morphology of the coatings; therefore, substrate engineering can be used to improve and control cell–substrate interactions.","Tahmasbi Rad, Armin;Solati-Hashjin, Mehran;Osman, Noor Azuan Abu;Faghihi, Shahab",2014-09-30,Ceramics International,"Hydroxyapatite coating,Electrophoretic deposition,Dynamic voltage,Physical performance,Biological response",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.04.116,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.04.116
Hot corrosion resistance of air plasma sprayed ceramic Sm2SrAl2O7 (SSA) thermal barrier coatings in simulated gas turbine environments,"Samarium strontium aluminate (Sm2SrAl2O7-SSA) and Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) were developed on NiCrAlY bond coated Inconel 718 superalloy substrate using air plasma spray process. The hot corrosion study was conducted in simulated gas turbine environments (molten mixtures of 50 wt% Na2SO4 + 50 wt% V2O5 and 90 wt% Na2SO4 + 5 wt% V2O5 + 5 wt% NaCl) for two different temperatures of 700 and 900 °C. A developed SSA TBCs showed about 8% and 22% lower lifetime at 700 and 900 °C, respectively than YSZ TBCs in 50 wt% Na2SO4 + 50 wt% V2O5 (vanadate). The hot corrosion life of SSA TBCs being found about 13% and 39% lower than YSZ TBCs in 90 wt% Na2SO4 + 5 wt% V2O5 + 5 wt% NaCl (chloride) at 700 and 900 °C, respectively. X-ray diffraction results showed the formation of SmVO4, SrV2O6, and SrSO4 as a major hot corrosion product in 50 wt% Na2SO4 + 50 wt% V2O5 and 90 wt% Na2SO4 + 5 wt% V2O5 + 5 wt% NaCl environments respectively for SSA TBCs. Similarly, YSZ TBCs also showed YVO4 as hot corrosion product in vanadate and chloride environments. Both the TBCs suffer a more severe hot corrosion attack in chloride environment at 900 °C. The leaching of Sr2+ and Y3+ ions from SSA and YSZ respectively play a vital role in the destabilization of coating in vanadate and chloride environments at 700 and 900 °C. In both SSA and YSZ TBCs, the leaching of ion has significantly low influence as compared to attack by chloride ions at the bond coat-top coat interface in the presence of chloride environment. The hot corrosion resistance of SSA TBCs was improved three times higher in the presence of MgO and NiO inhibitor in vanadate environment at 900 °C mainly due to the formation of a stable Ni3V2O8 phase at the surface.","Baskaran, T.;Arya, Shashi Bhushan",2018-10-15,Ceramics International,"Hot corrosion,Thermal barrier coatings,Vanadates and chlorides molten salt,Air plasma spray,Inhibitor",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.234,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.234
Damage evolution and fracture of ceramic coating systems in circle plate bending tests: Experimental observation and modeling,"The coating thickness-dependent damage and fracture of ceramic coating systems were investigated systematically by using circle plate bending tests based on a scanning electron microscope. Through experimental observations and measurements, results demonstrated that the damage of coating layer appeared because of effects of both radial and circumferential moments for thin coating cases, and because of main circumferential moment effect for thick ones. A circle plate bending damage model for the coating layer was presented to describe coating layer damage evolution and fracture. Via the model, one can effectively predict the failure phenomena of coating layer under the circle plate bending, which were consistent with experimental observations. In addition, modeling results of the relationships between critical external loads and damage zone sizes for coating layer were also consistent with experimental measurements. The damage was found to have a catastrophic characteristic near the failure point based on the mathematic damage model.","Liu, H.Y.;Wei, Y.G.;Liang, L.H.;Liu, X.H.;Wang, Y.B.;Long, H.",2020-04-15,Ceramics International,"Ceramic coating systems,Fracture,Damage model,Circle plate bending",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.065,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.065
Microstructure and anti-oxidation properties of multi-composition ceramic coatings for carbon/carbon composites,"To protect carbon/carbon (C/C) composites from oxidation at elevated temperature, an effective WSi2–CrSi2–Si ceramic coating was deposited on the surface of SiC coated C/C composites by a simple and low-cost slurry method. The microstructures of the double-layer coatings were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy analyses. The coating exhibited excellent oxidation resistance and thermal shock resistance. It could protect C/C composites from oxidation in air at 1773K for 300h with only 0.1wt.% mass gain and endure the thermal shock for 30 cycles between 1773K and room temperature. The excellent anti-oxidation ability of the double-layer WSi2–CrSi2–Si/SiC coating is mainly attributed to the dense structure of the coating and the formation of stable vitreous composition including SiO2 and Cr2O3 produced during oxidation.","Tao, Feng;He-Jun, Li;Qian-Gang, Fu;Yu-Lei, Zhang;Xiao-Hong, Shi",2011-01-31,Ceramics International,"Carbon/carbon composites,Ceramic,Coating,Oxidation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2010.08.027,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2010.08.027
On the formation and properties of chromium carbide and vanadium carbide coatings produced on W1 tool steel through thermal reactive diffusion (TRD),"Carbide coatings have been used to enhance the lifetime service of molds used for hot and cold forging, extrusion and powder metallurgy which are subjected to abrasive forces. Thermal reactive diffusion (TRD) process via molten salt bath is one of the coating processes suitable for the mentioned applications. The process has many advantages including excellent adhesion to the substrate as well as cost efficiency over other similar surface coating methods. The novelty in this research is the formation of hard carbide coatings using two separate oxide baths containing chromium oxide (Cr2O3) and vanadium oxide (V2O5). The coatings were produced on W1 tool steel by using TRD method via molten salt baths at 1000 °C for 8, 10 and 12 h, respectively. Phase structure, composition and microstructure of the coatings were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron probe micro-analyzer (EPMA), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The hardness of the coatings was evaluated by micro-indentation test. The results showed that chromium carbide and vanadium carbide coatings are formed successfully on the substrate with chemical formula Cr7C3 and VC, respectively. Vanadium carbide layer showed higher hardness (1854 HV) relative to the chromium carbide layer (1782 HV). However, its thickness (16 μm) was relatively lower than that of the chromium carbide layer (20 μm) after similar immersion time of 12 h. Moreover, it was found that, while the coating thickness increases with time, there is a specific time to reach the optimum thickness for each type of coatings.","Ganji, Omid;Sajjadi, Seyed Abdolkarim;Yang, Zhi Gang;Mirjalili, Mostafa;Najari, Mohammad Reza",2020-11-30,Ceramics International,"Thermal reactive diffusion,Oxide bath,Carbide coatings,Vanadium carbide,Chromium carbide,Hardness",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.326,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.326
Characterization of plasma electrolytic oxidation coating on low carbon steel prepared from silicate electrolyte with Al nanoparticles,"The plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) coatings were prepared on low carbon steel from silicate electrolyte without and with Al nanoparticles, respectively. The structure, composition, anti-wear and anti-corrosion properties of the PEO coatings were investigated. The results indicated that the Al nanoparticles in the silicate electrolyte turned into alumina during the PEO process and reduced the amount of iron oxides in the coating. The PEO coating prepared from silicate electrolyte with Al nanoparticles showed enhanced wear resistance due to the formation of alumina. Furthermore, the coating was characterized by sealed pores on the surface, different from the open pores on the surface of PEO coating prepared from silicate electrolyte without Al nanoparticles. The modified structure and the changed composition of PEO coating by introducing Al nanoparticles in the electrolyte significantly improved the corrosion resistance of the coating, demonstrated by the electrochemical corrosion and salt spray tests.","Yang, Wenbin;Liu, Weimin;Peng, Zhenjun;Liu, Baixing;Liang, Jun",2017-12-15,Ceramics International,"Low carbon steel,Plasma electrolytic oxidation,Al nanoparticles,Tribology,Corrosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.084,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.084
Osseointegration of sputtered SiC-added hydroxyapatite for orthopaedic applications,"Over the last few years, a trend in medical applications is to find solutions for metallic implants using coatings that can improve bioactivity and osseointegration. The goal of this study was to obtain and investigate sputtered hydroxyapatite coatings enriched with SiC to enhance the bioactivity and osseointegration of Ti alloys used in orthopaedic applications. The films were characterized in terms of phase composition, roughness, corrosion resistance in a synthetic body fluid (SBF) and in vitro biocompatibility with MG 63 osteoblast-like cells. All of the investigations were conducted using XRD, AFM, cell viability assays and proliferation tests. The results revealed that the addition of SiC had a positive influence on the properties of the sputtered hydroxyapatite. The addition of SiC led to an improvement in coating adhesion and corrosion resistance in an SBF solution over the HAP coating. All of the coatings presented cell viability values over 90%, revealing their suitability for medical applications.","Vranceanu, D.M.;Cotrut, C.M.;Bramowicz, M.;Titorencu, I.;Kulesza, S.;Kiss, A.;Berbecaru, A.;Pruna, V.;Branzei, M.;Vladescu, A.",2016-06-30,Ceramics International,"B: Porosity,C: Corrosion,D: Apatite,E: Biomedical applications",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.03.114,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.03.114
Nanostructured SnO2 thin films for NO2 gas sensing applications,We report the synthesis of nanostructured SnO2 by a simple inexpensive sol–gel spin coating method using m-cresol as a solvent. This method facilitates rapid synthesis at comparatively lower temperature enabling formation of nanostructures suitable for gas-sensing applications. Various physicochemical techniques have been used for the characterization of SnO2 thin films. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the single-phase formation of tetragonal SnO2 having crystallite size 5–10nm. SnO2 showed highest response (19%) with 77.90% stability toward 100ppm nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at 200°C. The response time of 7s and recovery time of 20min were also observed with the same operating parameters. The probable mechanism is proposed to explain the selective response toward nitrogen dioxide. Impedance spectroscopy studies showed that the response to nitrogen dioxide is mainly contributed by grain boundaries. The reproducibility and stability study of SnO2 sensor confirmed its candidature for detection of NO2 gas at low concentration (10–100ppm) and lower operating temperature.,"Khuspe, G.D.;Sakhare, R.D.;Navale, S.T.;Chougule, M.A.;Kolekar, Y.D.;Mulik, R.N.;Pawar, R.C.;Lee, C.S.;Patil, V.B.",2013-12-31,Ceramics International,"Sol–gel synthesis,SnO2 thin films,Crystal structure,NO2 sensor,Stability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.04.047,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.04.047
Hydrophobic surface modification toward highly stable K2SiF6:Mn4+ phosphor for white light-emitting diodes,"K2SiF6:Mn4+ phosphor is well known for its excellent red emission performance which is vital for improving the color rendering of white light-emitting diodes. However, the poor moisture resistance limits its application in optical devices. In this paper, K2SiF6:Mn4+ phosphor is coated with an inorganic hydrophobic protective layer to obtain good moisture resistance. Chemical vapor deposition method was used to decompose acetylene at high temperature, and the generated nanoscale carbon layer worked as a hydrophobic protective coating on the surface of the phosphor. Microstructure, compositions and properties of the synthesized K2SiF6:Mn4+@C phosphor were investigated in detail. It is found that most of the deposited carbon is coated on the surface of phosphor crystals in amorphous state. The carbon atoms are bonded with the fluorine element in K2SiF6:Mn4+ phosphor, forming carbon-fluorine (C–F) covalent bonds. The moisture resistance of K2SiF6:Mn4+@C phosphor is improved owing to the protection of the hydrophobic carbon. The relative emission intensity of K2SiF6:Mn4+@C phosphor could maintain 73% of the initial luminous intensity after immersing in the aqueous solution at room temperature for 8 h, whereas K2SiF6:Mn4+ phosphor without carbon coating was only 0.7% remaining of the initial value under the same conditions.","Liu, Yun-Xia;Hu, Jia-Xu;Ju, Li-Cheng;Cai, Chao;Hao, Van-Bui;Zhang, Sheng-Hui;Zhang, Zong-Wei;Xu, Xin;Jian, Xian;Yin, Liang-Jun",2020-05-31,Ceramics International,"K2SiF6:Mn4+,Chemical vapor deposition,Moisture-resistant,Carbon coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.123,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.123
Effect of Cu doping on the structural and electrochemical properties of lithium-rich Li1.25Mn0.50Ni0.125Co0.125O2 nanopowders as a cathode material,"Lithium- manganese-rich oxides are believed to be suitable candidate for cathode materials in the next generation of lithium-ion batteries. However, they have some disadvantages such as low initial coulombic efficiency, low rate capacity, and deficient cyclability. Different approaches such as elemental doping and surface coating have been adopted to overcome these shortcomings. In this study, Cu-doped Li1.25Mn0.50Ni0.125Co0.125O2 was synthesized by sol-gel method. The prepared samples were characterized using thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, surface area analysis, and field emission scanning electron microscopy. Galvanostatic charge-discharge measurement and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were also conducted to investigate the electrochemical performance of the prepared samples. The XRD patterns revealed that all the samples had two phase structures. By doping Cu, the lattice parameters and the volume of the samples changed. The first discharge capacity of the doped samples was found to be lower than that of the undopped sample. In comparison with the pristine material, Cu-doped ones displayed better cycling performance and rate capability. The Li1.25Mn0.50Ni0.125Co0.125-xCuxO2 sample (with x = 0.05), which delivers an initial discharge capacity of 225.2 mAhg−1 at 0.1 C, was found to have the highest capacity retention with the best cycling performance (207.4 mAhg−1), after 50 cycles. The optimum performance of the doped samples could be related to its lower charge transfer resistance and better structural stability.","Sorboni, Y.

Effects of plasma spray parameters on TiO2-coated mild steel using design of experiment (DoE) approach,"In this study, a design of experiment (DoE) method was utilised to identify the effect of air plasma spray (APS) parameters on several main properties of titanium dioxide (TiO2) coatings. Titanium dioxide (titania) feedstocks with sizes ranging from 10μm to 45μm were sprayed onto the mild steel substrates with different plasma spraying parameters. A 24 full factorial design was used to investigate the effects of four varying principal parameters at two levels, namely, the plasma power (20 and 40KW), the powder feed rate (6 and 22g/min), the scanning speed (0.2 and 0.5m/s), and the number of cycles (10 and 20), on four important properties of coatings; microhardness, thickness/cycle, deposition efficiency (DE), and porosity. The results showed that one the most important factor in affecting all responses was the plasma power. It strongly affected the hardness and the porosity which had a primary effect on the thickness/cycle and the DE values. In contrast, the interaction of the powder feed rate and the scanning speed had a negative effects on both thickness/cycle and DE. The number of cycles has no profound effect on the considered responses; it can only be used as a factor to achieve different coating thicknesses. To conclude, a plasma power of 30kW with a low level of powder feed rate of 6g/min and 0.5m/s of scanning speed is most preferable to optimise TiO2 coating deposition on mild steels.","Forghani, S.M.;Ghazali, M.J.;Muchtar, A.;Daud, A.R.;Yusoff, N.H.N.;Azhari, C.H.",2013-04-30,Ceramics International,"B.

Oxidative protection of a carbon-bonded carbon fiber composite with double-layer coating of MoSi2-SiC whisker and TaSi2-MoSi2-SiC whisker by slurry method,"This paper presents a double-layered coating system consisting of MoSi2 ceramic reinforced with SiC whiskers and a MoSi2-TaSi2 ceramic coating reinforced with SiC whiskers. This system improves oxidation resistance of carbon-bonded carbon fiber (CBCF) composites. Double-layer coating was about 160µm in thickness and no interfaces or cracks between the layer and matrix were observed. Isothermal oxidation tests revealed that as-prepared coating presented excellent oxidation resistance, which could protect CBCF composites at 1500°C for 160min with 0.02% weight loss, whereas weight loss of single MoSi2 ceramic coating reinforced with SiC whiskers reached 0.08%.

Preparation of biphasic hydroxyapatite/ β-tricalcium phosphate foam using the replication technique,"Biphasic hydroxyapatite/β-tricalcium phosphate foams were prepared using the replication technique starting from a precipitated hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2: HAP) powder, and sodium glycerophosphate (GP). The effect of the grinding time, solid loading, dispersant amount, and etching, replication, and sintering processes were investigated. The SEM, OEM and FTIR analyses proved that the surface of the polyurethane template must be treated with NaOH solution to make it more hydrophilic prior to the coating process. With a solid loading of 40 wt-%, the slurries prepared from the precipitated hydroxyapatite presented a shear thinning behavior, which was useful for the coating process. The SEM analysis of the foams showed that the optimum number of coating layers to obtain foam with an identical structure with the template was limited to three. The use of GP and the optimized preparation parameters helped to decrease the consolidation temperature of the ceramic foams to 1000 °C. The XRD and FTIR analyses of the prepared foams showed that the thermal treatment of the GP and the HAP mixture led to a partial decomposition of the HAP to tricalcium phosphate. The fitting of the XRD patterns and the obtained lattice parameters proved that the decomposition was accompanied by the insertion of sodium from GP toward the lattice of tricalcium phosphate and the formation of Na-β-tricalcium. The results of the SEM analysis, the pore size distribution and the mechanical strength showed that the presence of the Na-β-tricalcium reduced the pore size distribution from 500-2700 to 100–1700 μm, decreased slightly the total porosity from 80 vol-% to 70 vol-%; and improved the mechanical strength of the obtained foam from 1.56 MPa to 2.60 MPa.","Khallok, Hamza;Elouahli, Abdelaziz;Ojala, Satu;Keiski, Riitta L.;Kheribech, Abdelmoula;Hatim, Zineb",2020-10-01,Ceramics International,"Calcium phosphate,Sodium glycerophosphate,Coating,Sintering,Porous bio-ceramic",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.019
Metal oxide one dimensional photonic crystals made by RF sputtering and spin coating,"We report here the analysis of the light transmission properties of one dimensional photonic crystals made by multilayers of silicon dioxide and titanium dioxide. A precise fabrication by radiofrequency sputtering of a photonic crystal allows us to accurately model the transmission spectrum of the crystal, by taking into account the wavelength dependent refractive indexes of the materials. We found that, while the dispersion of silicon dioxide is in good agreement with data reported in literature, the dispersion of titanium dioxide is more critical. Using such dispersions we could fit the transmission spectra of silicon dioxide/titanium dioxide one dimensional photonic crystals made by spin coating layer deposition starting from nanoparticle colloidal dispersions. The fit takes into account the porosity of the layers and the losses due to Rayleigh scattering.","Scotognella, Francesco;Chiasera, Alessandro;Criante, Luigino;Aluicio-Sarduy, Eduardo;Varas, Stefano;Pelli, Stefano;Łukowiak, Anna;Righini, Giancarlo C.;Ramponi, Roberta;Ferrari, Maurizio",2015-08-31,Ceramics International,"Photonic crystals,Silica,Titania,Sol gel",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.03.077,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.03.077
Effect of different solvents on the structural and optical properties of zinc oxide thin films for optoelectronic applications,"Zinc oxide (ZnO) seed solutions were prepared using 4 different solvents, namely, methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH), isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and 2-methoxyethanol (2-ME). The prepared seed solutions were used to synthesize ZnO thin films using a low-cost sol–gel spin-coating method. The effect of different solvents on the structural and optical properties of ZnO thin films was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and an ultraviolet–visible–near infrared spectrophotometer (UV–vis–NIR). The images obtained in the FESEM and AFM showed that the thin film prepared using 2-ME has the smallest grain size. Moreover, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) results showed that the synthesized ZnO films are polycrystalline with preferred orientation along the (002) plane, whereas the IPA-derived films have a preferred orientation on (101) plane. The ZnO thin film synthesized with 2-ME has the highest transmittance (>90%), lowest surface roughness of 3.131nm and highest band gap energy of 3.28eV.

In vitro bioactivity of silicon nitride–hydroxyapatite composites,"Silicon nitride-based ceramics are characterised especially by high chemical resistance, superior combination of fracture toughness, hardness and bioinertness. However, the biological applications often require additional properties, e.g. bioactivity enabling stronger bonding to the host tissue. Hydroxyapatite coating prepared by sol–gel route, which provides pure, stable and nano-crystalline product is one of the ways to achieve bioactivity of bioinert ceramics. Therefore silicon nitride–hydroxyapatite composites were prepared by infiltration of hydroxyapatite precursor sol into the silicon nitride based porous ceramics. The conditions of sol preparation were optimised to be appropriate for pure HA synthesis: ageing at elevated temperature (85°C) and calcinations at 500°C for 1h. Cytotoxicity and in vitro bioactivity of Si3N4–HA composites were tested in order to verify the effect of hydroxyapatite addition on the biological properties of composite. After immersion of porous composite into simulated body fluid (SBF) for 21 days, calcium phosphate layer was formed on the surface of silicon nitride–hydroxyapatite composites, indicating their bioactivity.","Precnerová, Magdaléna;Bodišová, Katarína;Frajkorová, Františka;Galusková, Dagmar;Varchulová Nováková, Zuzana;Vojtaššák, Ján;Lenčéš, Zoltán;Šajgalík, Pavol",2015-07-31,Ceramics International,"D.

Sintering behaviour and properties of YAlSiO and YAlSiON glass-ceramics,"Four different YAlSiO and YAlSiON compositions that produced either glass or glass-ceramic materials were designed. Densities, glass transition temperatures, coefficients of thermal expansion and hardness data were established for each material. The sintering behavior was determined from the hot stage microscopy (HSM) runs. For the YAlSiO glass compositions, the viscosity–temperature curves were estimated from five characteristic HSM points using Scholze's method. The YAlSiON glass-ceramics with higher Y content showed YAlO3 and SiAl6O2N6 crystals and the poorer Y composition had crystalline precipitates of Si3N4, Si4Al2O2N6 and Y2SiAlO5N. The effects of the Al/Si and Y/Si ratios, and the nitrogen content on the properties have been discussed. These glass-ceramics showed relatively high thermal expansion coefficient and hardness and, therefore, its application as protective coatings for metallic components against high temperatures and/or corrosive environments is envisaged.","Sainz, M.A.;Miranzo, P.;Osendi, M.I.",2011-07-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Effect of codeposition parameters on the hardness and adhesion of TiVN coatings,"A systematic study of the effect of PVD cathodic arc deposition parameters on TiVN coating performance was carried out to analyze the structure, surface morphology, chemical composition, hardness and adhesion of these coatings. The effects of four factors including operation pressure, substrate bias voltage, and the currents applied to the Ti target and to the V target were evaluated. The investigated coatings were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, adhesion tests (i.e., scratch tests) and Vickers microhardness tests. The results of this study showed that the current applied to the V target was the factor having the greatest effect on TiVN coating hardness, while the bias voltage applied to the substrate had the greatest effect on adhesion strength.

Chemical vapour deposition of pyrolytic carbon from impinging jets,Pyrolytic carbon coatings were deposited on a graphite substrate by chemical vapour deposition technique from impinging jets of ethylene gas. The growth and structure of the coatings were investigated as a function of gas flow velocity. The deposition rate of the coatings increased linearly with the square root of gas velocity or flow rate of ethylene. This behaviour was explained by a mass-transport theory. The coatings exhibited cone-like morphology at low gas velocities and cauliflower-like morphology at high gas velocities. Textural analyses revealed that all the coatings were preferentially oriented in the 〈001〉 direction perpendicular to the substrate.,"Eroglu, S.;Gallois, B.M.",1996-12-31,Ceramics International, ,10.1016/0272-8842(95)00121-2,https://doi.org/10.1016/0272-8842(95)00121-2
Tribological behaviors of single and dual sol–gel ceramic films on Ti–6Al–4V,"TiO2, SiO2, hydroxyapatite (HA), TiO2–HA and SiO2–HA thin films with good biocompatibility were grown on Ti–6Al–4V (coded as TC4) substrate by sol–gel and dip-coating processes from specially formulated sols, followed by annealing at 500°C. The chemical states of some typical elements in the target films were detected by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). High-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is applied to characterize the surface and cross-sectional morphologies of obtained films. Various phases of the films were characterized by XRD. The tribological properties of thin films sliding against an AISI52100 steel ball were evaluated on a reciprocating friction and wear tester. As a result, the target films were obtained. Compared with the TC4 substrate, all the sol–gel ceramic films are superior in resisting wear. Among all, HA film shows the best resistance while SiO2 film shows the worst wear resistance both under higher (3N) and lower load (1N). TiO2 shows a good wear resistance under lower load but higher load. Compared with TiO2, the wear resistance of the dual film TiO2–HA can be improved under 3N but deteriorated under 1N. Compared with SiO2, the wear resistance of SiO2–HA is improved both under 3N and 1N. Compared with HA, the wear resistances of dual films are deteriorated both under 3N and 1N. Under 0.5N, a very long wear life for TiO2–HA is also obtained, illustrating that the lower wear resistance of dual films is closely related to the applied load. SEM observation of the morphologies of worn surfaces indicates that the wear of TC4 is characterized by abrasive wear. Differently, abrasion, plastic deformation and micro-crack dominate the wear of ceramic films. The superior friction reduction and wear resistance of HA films are greatly attributed to the slight plastic deformation of the film. Sol–gel is a potential method being applied to implant materials for wear protection according to proper process designs. The single HA film and the dual TiO2–HA film is suggested for biomedical application from the point of view of wear protection.","Zhang, Wenguang;Liu, Weimin;Liu, Ying;Wang, Chengtao",2009-05-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Stabilizing the structure and suppressing the voltage decay of Li[Li0.2Mn0.54Co0.13Ni0.13]O2 cathode materials for Li-ion batteries via multifunctional Pr oxide surface modification,"The development of Li-rich layer cathode materials has been limited by poor cycle, rate performance, phase transformation and voltage decay. To improve these properties, a facile and low-cost wet method is employed to fabricate Pr6O11 coating layer on Li[Li0.2Mn0.54Co0.13Ni0.13]O2 nanoparticles. The 3–6nm Pr6O11 coating layer is observed on the surface of Li[Li0.2Mn0.54Co0.13Ni0.13]O2 by HRTEM. Interestingly, HAADF-STEM and EDS analyses show that the transition metal ions and the praseodymium ions mutually infiltrate in the Pr6O11 coating layer and Li[Li0.2Mn0.54Co0.13Ni0.13]O2 nanoparticles during calcination. A combination of HAADF-STEM with EDS and XPS studies reveals that Pr6O11 coating layer is bridged to Li[Li0.2Mn0.54Co0.13Ni0.13]O2 nanoparticles by the chemical bonds of transition phase Li1.2MXPr1−xO2. XRD patterns show that all samples are indexed to the layered structure α-NaFeO2, but the lattice parameters are influenced lightly after Pr6O11 coating. HRTEM and SAED analyses elucidate that the super large Pr ions surface-doping and the Pr6O11 coating are verified to suppress the transformation of layer to spinel structure in the bulk nanoparticles after cycles. The sample coated with 3wt% Pr6O11 exhibits wonderful electrochemical performance with the first coulomb efficiency of 85.6%, the capacity retention ratio of 97.9% after 50 cycles and the discharge capacity of 162.2mAhg−1 at 5C. The resistant of charge transfer and the electrodes polarization are reduced by Pr6O11 coating according to EIS. Therefore, Pr6O11, which contains the super large Pr ions, plays two roles: the first one, it is coated on the Li[Li0.2Mn0.54Co0.13Ni0.13]O2 nanoparticles to optimize the environment of the interface reaction between electrodes and electrolyte; the other one, its Pr ions surface-doping stabilizes the structure in the superficial region of Li[Li0.2Mn0.54Co0.13Ni0.13]O2 nanoparticles and suppresses the voltage decay. The multifunctional Pr6O11 can play a significant role in accelerating development of new materials with excellent stabilization and high capacity.","Li, Jiguang;Li, Jianling;Yu, Tianheng;Ding, Feixiang;Xu, Guofeng;Li, Zhanyu;Zhao, Yuguang;Kang, Feiyu",2016-12-31,Ceramics International,"Pr6O11 coating,Super large Pr ions surface-doping,Stabilizing the structure,Suppressing the voltage decay,Li[Li0.2Mn0.54Co0.13Ni0.13]O2 nanoparticles",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.08.206,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.08.206
Preparation and wear properties of Ni/TiN–SiC nanocoatings obtained by pulse current electrodeposition,"In this report, Ni/TiN–SiC nanocoatings were designed by pulse current electrodeposition (PCE) technique. The influence of plating parameters on morphology, microstructure, microhardness, and wear behavior of the as-obtained coatings were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), triboindentry, and abrasion testing. Results indicated incorporation of numerous TiN and SiC nanoparticles in Ni/TiN–SiC nanocoatings prepared at 4 A/dm2. Average sizes of TiN and SiC nanoparticles were estimated to 45.9 nm and 37.2 nm, respectively. Cross-sectional views of nanocoating obtained at 4 A/dm2 revealed high concentrations of Ti (19.6 at%), Si (12.1 at%), and Ni (53.3 at%). Hence, Ni/TiN–SiC nanocoating deposited at 4 A/dm2 with average microhardness of 848.5 Hv illustrated the highest microhardness when compared to other nanocoatings. On the other hand, wear rate of Ni/TiN–SiC nanocoating prepared at 4 A/dm2 was only 13.6 mg/min, indicating excellent wear resistance. In addition, only some small surface scratches were observed, indicating outstanding wear performance.","Xia, Fafeng;Li, Qiang;Ma, Chunyang;Liu, Wenqing;Ma, Zhipeng",2020-04-15,Ceramics International,"Ni/TiN–SiC nanocoating,Pulse current electrodeposition,Microstructure,Microhardness,Wear resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.017
Evaluation of nanosecond laser ablation and scratch resistance of tantalum carbide coated graphite substrates,"The present work aimed at investigating the effect of nanosecond laser parameters on ablation characteristics such as ablation depth and surface roughness of plasma sprayed tantalum carbide coated graphite substrates. The micro scratch tests were performed on the laser ablated and as-sprayed coatings to evaluate the critical loads and coefficient of friction. The laser ablated surface with minimum ablation depth and surface roughness was found to exhibit 18% higher critical loads when compared to that of as-sprayed surface. However, laser ablated surfaces exhibited slightly higher friction coefficient than as-sprayed surfaces due to formation of metastable oxide layer (Ta6O) on the top surface of TaC coatings as indicated by XRD. The maximum ablation and scratch resistance could be found at maximum pulse energy of 250 μJ, maximum scanning speed of 1000 mm/s and moderate hatch spacing of 20 μm. While, the failure of as-sprayed TaC coatings was attributed to local collapsing of material due to degradation of mechanical properties such as elastic modulus, surface porosity and surface roughness, laser ablated surfaces exhibited wedge spallation at the end of scratch zone only.","Harish, D.V.N.;A, Bharatish;Murthy, H.N.

Significance of sensitization process in electroless deposition of Ni on nanosized Al2O3 powders,"The electroless deposition of Ni on nanosized α-Al2O3 powders of about 150nm diameter has been studied by employing SnCl2 sensitization and PdCl2 activation approach. The bath for electroless deposition was prepared by using NiCl2·6H2O, C6H5NaO7·H2O, NH4Cl and NaH2PO2·H2O, and the deposition was carried out at a bath temperature of 70°C with a pH value of 8.5. The morphology, microstructure and phase structure of Ni-coated α-Al2O3 nanopowders were characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffractometry (XRD), respectively. It is found that, the sensitization process followed by repetitive resining greatly affects the morphology of Ni deposited in the form of nanoparticles onto the ultrafine alumina particles, different from the conventional continuous electroless film/coating deposited on coarser particles. The resining of the SnCl2 sensitized ultrafine α-Al2O3 particles prior to PdCl2 activation process leads to varied amount of deposited Ni particles with diameters of 50–80nm on the Al2O3. It is revealed that, subsequent reduction process (activation) from Pd2+ to Pd is linked to the original sites of Sn2+ by simultaneous oxidation process from Sn2+ to Sn4+ on the previously sensitized α-Al2O3 nanopowders. Consequently, the form of deposited Ni correlated closely to the surface distribution of reduced Pd which may be continuous or discrete determined predominantly by the density of adsorbed Sn2+ on the powders during sensitization process. It demonstrates a possibility of depositing different distribution structures of metals on nanosized α-Al2O3 powders through controlling SnCl2 sensitization process.","Pang, J.N.;Jiang, S.W.;Lin, H.;Wang, Z.Q.",2016-02-15,Ceramics International,"Electroless deposition,Ni nanoparticles,Al2O3,Sensitization,Activation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.11.137,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.11.137
Tribological behavior of ZrO2/WS2 coating surfaces with biomimetic shark-skin structure,"This study demonstrated the dry friction and wear behavior of sol-gel ZrO2/WS2 coatings with biomimetic shark-skin textured surfaces. The effect of added WS2 on the microstructure and mechanical properties of ZrO2 coatings was examined and the dry sliding wear and friction behaviors against commercial AISI1045 steel balls were investigated. After adding WS2, the micro hardness of ZrO2 coating decreased by ~39% (from 23.7 GPa to 14.5 GPa), and the average steady state friction coefficient was decreased from ~0.43 to ~ 0.2. When the ZrO2/WS2 coating surface was textured biomimetic shark skin, nearly 66% decrease of the average steady state friction coefficient and 82% decrease of ball wear rate were obtained as compared with the pure ZrO2 coatings. The possible frictional mechanism of the biomimetic shark-skin structures was discussed.","Li, Xuemu;Deng, Jianxin;Lu, Yang;Zhang, Liangliang;Sun, Jie;Wu, Fengfang",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"ZrO2 coatings,Tungsten disulfide,Shark-skin-inspired micro-grooves,Tribological properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.177,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.177
Structure and electrical insulation characteristics of plasma-sprayed alumina coatings under pressure,"In this work, alumina coatings were fabricated on 316LN austenitic stainless steel by a plasma spray technique. The pressure dependence of the surface electrical resistivity of alumina coatings was investigated in detail. A combination of scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction was employed to understand the microstructure and properties of the as-sprayed alumina coatings. The coatings can endure high pressures under a practical working environment. The surface electrical resistivity of the alumina coatings decreases continuously with an increase in pressure to 250MPa. Interestingly, the surface resistivity is still greater than 107 Ω·mm for 250MPa, demonstrating that the coatings have good electrical insulation properties and can be fully utilized in the magnet support of ITER.","Luo, Rongrong;Li, Pengyuan;Wei, Haihong;Chen, Hui;Yang, Kun",2018-04-15,Ceramics International,"Alumina coatings,Surface resistivity,Crystal structure,X-ray techniques",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.216,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.216
Thermal shock resistance of thermal barrier coatings for nickel-based superalloy by supersonic plasma spraying,"Double-layer thermal barrier coatings (TBCs), including a top ZrO2 layer and an inner CoNiCrAlY layer, were deposited on nickel-based superalloy using supersonic atmospheric plasma spraying (SAPS). Thermal shock resistance of the TBCs between 1200°C and room temperature was investigated. After thermal shock test, the adhesive strength of the coatings was evaluated through scratch test. The SAPS–TBCs present good thermal shock resistance, exhibiting only 0.26% mass gain up to 150-time thermal cycling. Before thermal cyclic treatment, SAPS–TBCs exhibited a strong adhesion with the absence of the thermally grown oxide (TGO) between out and inner layer. With the increasing of thermal cycles, the TGO layer was formed and its thickness firstly increased and then dropped down. The critical load fell down by about 32% for topcoat–bondcoat adhesion (up to 50 cycles) and 35% or so for TBCs–substrate adhesion (up to 150 cycles) compared to the counterpart of as-sprayed specimens. The strain introduced by the existence of TGO and mixed oxides resulted in a varied adhesion for TBCs on nickel-based alloy during thermal cycling.","Sun, Jia;Fu, Qian-Gang;Liu, Guan-Nan;Li, He-Jun;Shu, Yong-Chun;Fan, Gao",2015-09-30,Ceramics International,"C.

Synergistic effect of Ce4+ modification on the electrochemical performance of LiNi0·6Co0·2Mn0·2O2 cathode materials at high cut-off voltage,"Ni-rich layered LiNi0·6Co0·2Mn0·2O2 materials have recently drawn much attention for their high specific capacity. However, they still suffer from the cycling instability arising from Li+/Ni2+ ions mixing in crystal structure and harmful side reactions with electrolyte, especially charged at high cut-off voltage to achieve higher energy density. In this study, the Li(Ni0·6Co0·2Mn0.2)O2 (NCM622) cathode materials were prepared by sol-gel method, and Ce4+ modification was utilized to improve cycling stability and rate performance. Through XRD refinement, XPS, SEM and TEM characterization, it was found that in the case of 0.5 at% level, Ce4+ ions not only entered into the crystal lattice to replace transition metal ions, but also produced CeO2 coating on the surface of NCM622 particles. The results of electrochemical performance showed that after 100 cycles at 1 C rate, the capacity retention of NCM-0.5 sample increased by 11.03% compared to pristine sample. Besides, in the case of 5 C, the capacity of NCM-0.5 sample reached to 114.92 mAh·g−1, much higher than that of NCM-0 (91.92 mAh·g−1). The findings indicate that it is the synergistic effect of Ce4+ that endows NCM622 excellent cycling stability and rate performance at high cut-off voltage.","Wang, Ruoxing;Li, Zhimin;Yang, Zi;Zhang, Maolin;Zhang, Dongyan;Yan, Yangxi",2020-09-01,Ceramics International,"Lithium-ion battery,LiNi0·6Co0·2Mn0·2O2,Ce doping,Electrochemical performance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.247,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.247
YSZ/MoS2 self-lubricating coating fabricated by thermal spraying and hydrothermal reaction,"Thermal sprayed ceramic coatings have extensively been used in components to protect them against friction and wear. However, the poor lubricating ability severely limits their application. Herein, yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)/MoS2 composite coatings were successfully fabricated on steel substrate with the combination of thermal spraying technology and hydrothermal reaction. Results show that the synthetic MoS2 powders are composed of numbers of ultra-thin sheets (about 7 ~ 8 nm), and the sheet has obvious lamellar structure. After vacuum impregnation and hydrothermal reaction, numbers of MoS2 powders, look like flowers, generate inside the plasma sprayed YSZ coating. Moreover, the growing point of the MoS2 flower is the intrinsic micro-pores of YSZ coating. The friction and wear tests under high vacuum environment indicate that the composite coating has an extremely long lifetime (> 100,000 cycles) and possesses a low friction coefficient less than 0.1, which is lower by about 0.15 times than that of YSZ coating. Meanwhile, the composite shows an extremely low wear rate (2.30 × 10−7 mm3 N−1 m−1) and causes slight wear damage to the counterpart. The excellent lubricant and wear-resistant ability are attributed to the formation of MoS2 transfer films and the ultra-smooth of the worn surfaces of hybrid coatings.","Li, Shuangjian;Zhao, Xiaoqin;An, Yulong;Liu, Duanduan;Zhou, Huidi;Chen, Jianmin",2018-10-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal spray,YSZ/MoS2,Self-lubricating,Friction and wear,Transfer film",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.258,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.258
Use of cryogenic machining to improve the adhesion of sphene bioceramic coatings on titanium substrates for dental and orthopaedic applications,"Rods of commercially pure titanium were machined using standard oil-based emulsion and cryogenic cooling, and were then coated with sphene (CaTiSiO5) bioceramic by spray coating using an automatic airbrush. The sphene bioceramic was synthesized in-situ starting from a suspension of polysiloxane that used as SiO2 precursor, CaCO3 and TiO2 nanoparticles. The suspension was deposited on the machined substrates, which were heat treated up to 950 °C in order to promote the formation of sphene ceramic. The produced coated prototypes were characterized to evaluate the effect of the machining conditions on surface roughness and microstructure of the substrate, and thereby their effect on coating adhesion. Nanoindentation tests were employed to determine the hardness and elastic modulus of the coating through its thickness. Results showed that the reduced amount of defects on the surface of the cryo-machined substrates, contributed to increase the hardness, elastic modulus and adhesion strength of the coating-substrate interfaces compared to standard machined samples, therefore improving adhesion of the coating to the underlying substrate.","Biasetto, Lisa;Bertolini, Rachele;Elsayed, Hamada;Ghiotti, Andrea;Bruschi, Stefania",2019-04-01,Ceramics International,"Titanium,Machining,Cryogenic,Sphene,Coating adhesion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.063,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.063
Raspberry-like superhydrophobic silica coatings with self-cleaning properties,"Here we report, an easy, straightforward and novel way to prepare raspberry-like superhydrophobic silica coatings for self-cleaning applications. The hydrophobic silica particles were obtained by simple condensation of fluoroalkoxysilane (17FTMS) in ethanol at room temperature. These silica particles were embedded into the sol–gel processed silica matrix and deposited on glass plates. On this coating surface, water drops exhibited a contact angle of 152° and rolls off the surface at sliding angle of 10°. This extremely low sliding angle was employed to self-clean the superhydrophobic coating, where dirt particles accumulated on the surface of superhydrophobic coating was efficiently cleaned by quickly sliding water drops. The stability of the microstructure as well as the wetting properties of the coating surface was investigated by scratch resistance and water stream impact test. The superhydrophobic coatings endured against the scratch of applied force of ~150mN.

"Plasma sprayed TiO2: The influence of power of an electric supply on relations among stoichiometry, surface state and photocatalytic decomposition of acetone","The influence of input power on plasma sprayed coating was studied for a water-stabilized plasma spray torch (WSP®) and ceramic coatings formed from titanium dioxide (TiO2). All other spray setup parameters were secured during the experiment with electric supply power as the only variable factor. Physical characteristics of the coatings were tested by means of Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy which are able to determine the stoichiometry and surface chemical composition of the coatings. Further, stoichiometry and surface states are crucial for the photocatalytic efficiency of the coatings. The photocatalytic procedure involved was UV-induced decomposition of acetone. Links between the tested features are drawn. The lower supply power used during the spraying of TiO2 coating resulted in higher activity with respect to the photocatalytic point of view.

Cutting performance and wear mechanism of Ti–Al–N/Al–Cr–O coated silicon nitride ceramic cutting inserts,"In the present work, Ti–Al–N/Al–Cr–O coating was deposited on silicon nitride cutting inserts by PVD technique. The micro-structure, chemical composition, hardness and coating/substrate adhesion were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), micro-indentation and scratch tests, respectively. The cutting performance of the Ti–Al–N/Al–Cr–O coated silicon nitride cutting inserts were investigated in turning HT250 gray cast iron and AISI 4340 steel under dry environment. The uncoated inserts were applied for turning tests as comparison. The results revealed that higher hardness was obtained by covering Ti–Al–N/Al–Cr–O coating on silicon nitride cutting inserts with acceptable coating/substrate adhesion. The cutting performance of the Ti–Al–N/Al–Cr–O coated silicon nitride inserts was higher than that of the uncoated inserts for both gray cast iron and steel turning. The wear of the coated inserts was a combination of abrasion and adhesion under given cutting conditions, both in cast iron turning and steel turning. It can be concluded that the obtained Ti–Al–N/Al–Cr–O coated silicon nitride inserts perform better than uncoated inserts in cast iron and steel turning and are capable of reducing machining costs.","Long, Ying;Zeng, Junjie;Shanghua, Wu",2014-08-31,Ceramics International,"Silicon nitride cutting inserts,Ti–Al–N/Al–Cr–O coating,Cutting performance,Wear mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.02.038,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.02.038
Novel synthesis of core–shell structured Fe3O4@SiO2 nanoparticles via sodium silicate,"In this study, core–shell-structured Fe3O4@SiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized using sodium silicate (Na2SiO3), which is more suitable for mass production than the conventional silane precursor tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). In the particle-surface coating process to form a core–shell structure with Fe3O4, the Na2SiO3 was neutralized with HCl(aq) to form silane groups, and the resulting silane groups combined with hydroxyl groups (OH − ) present on the surfaces of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Because of the core–shell nanostructure of the single particles, the Fe3O4 nanoparticles were accompanied by significant changes in their intrinsic physicochemical properties. In addition, it was confirmed that there were differences in the thickness of the SiO2 under different neutralized pH conditions for the coating-layer implementation with Na2SiO3. The behavior of the Fe3O4 nanoparticle characteristics with respect to the SiO2 coating-layer thickness was primarily due to changes in the surface properties, associated with the degree of cathodic increase of the surface charge. An intensified negative surface charge enhanced the dispersibility of the particles in aqueous solution with enhanced electrostatic repulsion, which was even higher than that of the conventional TEOS-coated nanoparticles. In addition, the surface coating of SiO2 caused a decrease in magnetization with an increase in the coating-layer thickness, which was comparable to the general tendency associated with increasing the weight per unit particle. However, it was somewhat superior to those of the conventional TEOS method because of the difference in morphology.","Cha, Ji Hyun;Choi, Hyun-Hee;Jung, Yeon-Gil;Choi, Sung-Churl;An, Gye Seok",2020-07-31,Ceramics International,"Magnetite,Sodium silicate,Core–shell structure,Dispersion,Zeta potential",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.233,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.233
"Solution-based synthesis of dense, large grained CuIn(S, Se)2 thin films using elemental precursor","Compared with the expensive and complicated vacuum techniques, the solution-based process to deposit I-III-VI2 chalcogenide thin films (I=Cu, III=In or Ga, VI=S or Se) has attracted great interests due to its lower cost, higher scalable production and better application in flexible substrate. Herein, a low-toxic and high-active mixture solvent comprised of 1, 2-ethanedithiol and 1,2-ethylenediamine is utilized to dissolve elemental Cu, In and S powders at 60°C, forming the CuInS2 (CIS) precursor solution. After spin coating and annealing in a both Ar gas and selenium atmosphere, a dense and large-grained chalcopyrite CuIn(S,Se)2 (CISSe) thin films with a close-packed grain size of ~800nm are prepared, eliminating a undesired fine fine-grained bottom layer. In addition, the selenization temperature of the CISSe thin films is also discussed, which influences the phase composition, crystallinity and morphology of CISSe thin films.

Influence of interface morphology on erosion failure of thermal barrier coatings,"The thermal barrier coating system (TBCs) has complex structure and works in severe service environment. Erosion is one of the main factors causing the failure of TBCs. In the present study, the particle erosion process of atmospheric plasma sprayed (APS) thermal barrier coatings at elevated temperature was simulated by the finite element method. The effects of interface morphology on the penetration depth, particle ricochet velocity and interface stress state were studied, and the key parameters such as particle size, initial velocity and erosion position were also considered. The cosine curve with constant wavelength and varying amplitude was used to represent different interface roughness of TBCs. The results show that the interface morphology has little effect on the penetration depth of top coat (TC) and the particle ricochet velocity. The influence of particle erosion position related to the interface morphology is obvious. Basically, the greater the interface roughness is, the more violent the interfacial stress fluctuation is. During the erosion process, the stress in the middle of the interface is significantly higher than that at other positions. These results facilitate understanding of the particle erosion failure mechanism of APS TBCs. The influence of interface morphology should be considered in erosion research.","Yu, Q.M.;He, Q.;Ning, F.L.",2018-12-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Interface morphology,Particle erosion,Finite element method",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.188,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.188
Effect of hot dip silicon-plating temperature on microstructure characteristics of silicide coating on tungsten substrate,"W-silicide coatings were deposited on tungsten substrate by using hot dip silicon-plating method under various temperatures. The phase composition, microstructure, and concentration distribution of elements were investigated. The results show that the W-silicide coatings consist of WSi2 layer and interface layer (W5Si3 layer), and the WSi2 coatings have a strong preferred orientation on the (211) and (206) crystal faces. The hot dip temperature has a significant effect on thicknesses and grain sizes of coatings. With the increase of hot dip temperature, the thicknesses of WSi2 layer and W5Si3 layer, and grain sizes increase obviously. Moreover, a high silicon concentration is observed at coating surface when the temperature is 1560 °C, and the highest silicon concentration is about 46 wt% (84.79 at.%).","Zhang, Yingyi;Qie, Junmao;Cui, Kunkun;Fu, Tao;Fan, Xuelian;Wang, Jie;Zhang, Xu",2020-03-31,Ceramics International,"Tungsten,Tungsten disilicide,Hot dip silicon-plating,Coating,Microstructure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.270,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.270
Efficient visible light magnetic modified iron oxide photocatalysts,Magnetite iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles were synthesized via simple co-precipitation method using ferrous and ferric ions salts. Fe3O4 nanoparticles were modified by silica and titania. Pure and modified nanoparticles were employed for dye degradation under visible light. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated inverse spinel structure of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The particle size of magnetite nanoparticles is decreased due to coating of silica and titania. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy indicated the spherical morphology for all samples. The synthesized Fe3O4 nanoparticles were ferromagnetic in nature with highest saturation magnetization value of 1.1034emu as compared to silica and titania coated samples. Fourier transform infra-red spectra confirmed the incorporation of magnetite nanoparticles with silica and titania. Titania modified magnetite sample showed the highest photocatalytic activity as compared to silica modified magnetite nanoparticles and bare iron oxide under visible light irradiations.,"Shamaila, Sajjad;Bano, Tahira;Sajjad, Ahmed Khan Leghari",2017-12-01,Ceramics International,"Magnetite,Silica,Titania,Photocatalysis,Magnetic properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.193,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.193
Carbon-coated porous Si/C composite anode materials via two-step etching/coating processes for lithium-ion batteries,"A highly stable Si/SiOx/C composite was synthesized in this study through NaOH etching and carbon-coating approaches for use as an anode material in Li-ion batteries (LIBs). The two-step process not only enhanced the electronic conductivity of the as-synthesized Si/SiOx/C composite by using the two-step etching/coating processes to enhance the columbic efficiency of Si during cycling processes but also architecturally provided an amorphous Si/SiOx composite to buffer volume expansion. The Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction results demonstrate that the etching process involves a transition from crystalline Si to amorphous SiOx. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results further confirm that the vibration mode of Si–O bonding changes from symmetric to asymmetric. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis reveals that we can control specific surface area and pore-size distribution of NaOH-modified Si by tuning the parameters pertaining to the solid content of Si in NaOH solution. After optimizing the etching and carbon-coating processes, the modified Si/C composite delivered ~780 mAh g−1 for more than 200 cycles at 0.5C, which was better than un-modified one of 315 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles. The results clearly indicate that we could improve cycle stability of Si anode drastically through the NaOH etching process and carbon coating modification. The proposed methodology may provide a potential approach to promoting the synthesis of Si-based anodes for use in the commercial applications of LIBs.","Hsieh, Cheng-Che;Lin, Yan-Gu;Chiang, Chao-Lung;Liu, Wei-Ren",2020-12-01,Ceramics International,"Silicon,Sodium hydroxide,Etching,Anode,Lithium-ion batteries",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.128,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.128
Preparation and characterization of plasma-sprayed yttria stabilized zirconia as a potential substrate for NOx sensor,"Fully stabilized zirconia containing 8mol% of yttria was synthesized by solid state reaction method and deposited as a thick film by plasma spray coating. The crystal structure and phases developed were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The surface structure, surface morphology and microstructure developed were studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The actual doping content was measured by electron probe micro-analyzer(EPMA). The plasma sprayed YSZ was characterized for its electrolytic properties by ac and dc conductivity measurements. The maximum conductivity for plasma sprayed YSZ was found to be −1.62 Scm−1, which was lesser than the conductivity of standard 8YSZ of −1.03 Scm−1 at pO2=0.21atm. However; conductivity trends in the arrhenius plot was observed to be similar for entire YSZ's, suggesting that the conductivity mechanism is same and dominated by oxygen ion conductivity independent of oxygen partial pressure. These promising electrolytic properties of thermal sprayed YSZ suggest that the thermal spray coating method may lead to be used as a potential method for the fabrication of NOx sensor.","Son, Chanjin;Bhardwaj, Aman;Hong, Jae-Woon;Kim, Jin-Wook;Moon, Heung-Soo;Noh, Hyo-Seop;Song, Sun-Ju",2017-04-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal spray coating,YSZ,Electrolyte,Mixed potential theory,NOx sensor",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.001
Synthesis of Mo-doped TiO2/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite for photoelectrocatalytic applications,"This study was carried out with the goal of lowering the band gap and electron recombination of the titanium dioxide through doping with Mo, and hybridizing with reduced graphene oxide, respectively, for photoelectrocatalytic applications. Mo with various atomic percentages (0.5, 1, 2, and 3 at%) was doped with TiO2 using the mechanical alloying technique. The results of the ultraviolet diffuse reflectance spectroscopy analysis revealed that the TiO2 doped with 1 at% Mo possessed the lowest band gap energy. Also, to further improve the photoelectrocatalytic efficiency, the 1 at% Mo-doped TiO2 powder was hybridized with the reduced graphene oxide (RGO) through UV-assisted photocatalytic reduction of the graphene oxide. The XRD, FESEM, EDX, and FTIR analyses were implemented for characterization of the TiO2, 1 at% Mo-doped TiO2, and 1 at% Mo-doped TiO2/RGO powders. The superior integration of the TiO2 and RGO was achieved as a result of the photocatalytic reduction method. After coating the powders on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass using the doctor blade technique, linear sweep voltammetry, amperometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests were used to study the photoelectrocatalytic behavior of the samples. The results of the electrochemical tests showed that the photoelectrocatalytic activity of the TiO2 was significantly enhanced as doped with Mo, and hybridized with the RGO. The mechanisms affecting the photoelectrocatalytic response in the Mo-doped TiO2/RGO composite are discussed, as well.","Dargahi, Z.;Asgharzadeh, H.;Maleki-Ghaleh, H.",2018-08-01,Ceramics International,"A.

Formation of new MXene film using spinning coating method with DMSO solution and its application in advanced memristive device,"Uniform MXene films have been successfully achieved by tuning the process conditions and concentration of Ti3C2 in various solutions. Three different processing methods, i.e. mechanical exfoliation, dipping on wafer, and spin-coating technique, have been investigated in details. In addition, optimized conditions of concentration and dispersion of Ti3C2 in various solutions have been explored as well as spinning speed of spin coater. Next, the physical characteristics of MXene films were investigated and analyzed by optical microscopy (OM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. Moreover, the MXene films have been introduced into silicon-based devices using conventional semiconductor processing steps. For the first time, two-terminal memristive devices with MXene layers were fabricated.

Al2O3 coated LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode material by sol–gel method: Preparation and characterization,"LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2, a promising cathode material over conventional ones for lithium-ion battery, was synthesized via the sol–gel method. The cathode material was coated by Al2O3 through a modified coating process to improve the electrochemical cycle performance and rate capacity. For samples with thicker Al2O3 coating, there was an increase with a subsequent decrease in the discharge capacity for cut-off voltage increasing from 4.3–3.0V to 4.5–3.0V. The Al2O3 coating optimized at 5% can apparently improve the discharge capacity and the cycle performance of LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 at high voltage. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images also confirmed uniform coating at this optimized content. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and conductivity test results suggested suppression in the growth of charge transfer resistance and an enhancement in the conductivity for Al2O3-coated LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2.","Qiu, Qi;Huang, Xi;Chen, Yanmei;Tan, Yan;Lv, Weizhong",2014-08-31,Ceramics International,"Al2O3 coating,LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2,Cathode material,Electrochemical property",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.03.023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.03.023
The preparation and magnetic properties of sodium-modified iron oxide thin films by a solgel method,"Spinel-type thin magnetic films consisting of sodium-modified iron oxide were prepared using a solgel method and a dip-coating technique. Iron(III) nitrate [Fe(NO3)3 . 9H2O] and sodium methoxide [CH3ONa] were dissolved in ethylene glycol and 2-methoxyethanol to form the starting solution. The thickness was controlled by the solution parameters and withdrawal speed. Magnetization values depended on the amount of sodium doping [cNa = 0−0.5, where c Na = Na (Fe + Na) ], the temperature and the atmosphere during firing cycles. Films were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction measurement (cobalt anode), UV—VIS, SEM and magnetization measurements. Reasonable results were obtained for a sodium doping level of cNa = 0.2 at an annealing temperature of 430°C. The magnetization and coercive force were 188.5 × 103 T (150 emu/cm3) and 4 × 103 A/m (50 Oe), respectively.","Sedlar, Miroslav",1994-12-31,Ceramics International, ,10.1016/0272-8842(94)90011-6,https://doi.org/10.1016/0272-8842(94)90011-6
Preparation and characterization of Ni–AlN nanocoatings deposited by magnetic field assisted electrodeposition technique,"In this study, traditional nickel coating and Ni–AlN nanocoatings were deposited on mild steel surfaces using magnetic field-assisted electrodeposition (MFAED) technique. Microstructures, compositions, and microhardness values of nanocoatings were examined by digital holographic microscopy (DHM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The microhardness, wear, and corrosion properties of nanocoatings were also examined. The nanocoating prepared at 0.4 T (abbreviated as S-0.4) showed uniform and compact structure with AlN and Ni sizes around 42.7 nm and 84.2 nm, respectively. Diffraction peaks of nickel grains became broader and lower in intensity as magnetic field rose from 0.2 T to 0.4 T, indicating nickel grains refinement in S-0.4 nanocoating. Among three coatings, S-0.4 nanocoating exhibited the highest microhardness with average value of 846.2 Hv and lowest mass loss of 46.4 mg. By comparison, S-0 coating exhibited the highest mass loss with average value of 95.7 mg. S-0.4 nanocoating exhibited the minimum corrosion current density of 0.35 × 10−4 A/cm2, demonstrating the best corrosion resistance among all three coatings.","Xia, Fafeng;Li, Qiang;Ma, Chunyang;Guo, Xue",2020-02-01,Ceramics International,"Ni–AlN nanocoating,Magnetic field assisted electrodeposition,Microstructure,Crystal texture,Wear performance,Corrosion property",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.244,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.244
Effect of process conditions on spray dried calcium carbonate powders for thermal spraying,"Powder preparation is an important stage in the production of thermal spray coatings with the desired characteristics. An important powder feature is flowability, which can be adjusted through particle morphology, particle size and size distribution. Combined, these features dictate the quality of the coating produced. To increase a powder's flowability, spherical particles within a particular size range are ideal. One way to achieve this is through spray drying. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of spray drying process parameters on the physical properties of calcium carbonate powder, with the goal of producing large, spherical particles ranging between 50 and 100 μm in preparation for thermal spray experiments. A key aspect was the use of ethanol to aide in the production of large spheres. A 23 factorial design of experiments (DoE) was utilised to study the following process parameters: gas flow rate, feed flow rate and solids loading. The resulting powders were characterised in terms of particle size, morphology and production yield. Porous, hollow, spherical particles were produced in a suitable size range for thermal spraying, which was attributed to the rapid evaporation of ethanol. Statistical analysis was utilised to interpret trends between the spray drying parameters and powder characteristics quantitatively.","Chahal, H.K.;Matthews, S.;Jones, M.I.",2020-08-18,Ceramics International,"Powders: chemical preparation,Suspensions,Drying,Thermal applications",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.140,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.140
Influence of low velocity impact on oxidation performance of SiC coated C/SiC composites,"Dropped-weight impact tests were carried out to investigate the coating damage behavior of SiC coated plain-woven C/SiC composites under low velocity impact. The oxidation performance after impact was evaluated in a wet oxygen environment. The relationships between coating damage area, oxidizing weight loss and the flexural strength after oxidation with the impact energy were analyzed. It was concluded from the test results that 0.5 J was the impact energy corresponding to damage initiation of the coating, where the oxidation loss was 2.49% and the strength retention ratio was 94.92%, almost the same as the untreated coating. Between 0.5 J and 2 J, the weight loss of oxidation increased with impact energy, and the oxidation mechanism gradually changed from a diffusion-controlled local oxidation to a reaction-controlled uniform oxidation. When the impact energy was larger than 2 J, although the coating damage still increased with impact energy, weight loss and residual flexural strength remained almost constant. The residual strength remaining was no more than 8% of the non-oxidized C/SiC, indicating that the coating totally loses its anti-oxidation function.","Yao, Leijiang;Lyu, Peng;Bai, Guodong;Augousti, Andy T.",2019-11-30,Ceramics International,"C/SiC composites,Low velocity impact,Coating,Oxidation,Flexural strength",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.025
The influence of laser treatment on thermal shock resistance of plasma-sprayed nanostructured yttria stabilized zirconia thermal barrier coatings,"The main goal of this paper was to evaluate the effects of laser glazing on the microstructure and thermal shock resistance of nanostructured thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). To this end, nanostructured yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) top coat and NiCrAlY bond coat were deposited on Inconel 738LC substrate by air plasma spraying (APS). The Nd:YAG pulsed laser was used for laser treatment of top coat surface. The thermal shock behavior of plasma-sprayed and laser-glazed coatings was investigated by quenching the samples in cold water from 1000°C. The microstructure and phase composition of the coatings were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffractometry (XRD). Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was used to analyze the interface diffusion behavior of the bond coat elements. The results of SEM revealed that the laser glazing process reduced the surface roughness, eliminated the porosity of the surface and produced network cracks perpendicular to the surface. XRD results also indicated that both as-sprayed and laser glazed coatings consisted of non-transformable (T′) phase. Thermal shock test results showed that the lifetimes of the plasma-sprayed TBCs were almost doubled by laser glazing. Continuous network of segmented cracks perpendicular to the surface produced by laser glazing improved the strain accommodation and recognized it as the main enhancement mechanism for TBC life extension.","Ghasemi, Reza;Shoja-Razavi, Reza;Mozafarinia, Reza;Jamali, Hossein",2014-01-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Nanomechanical behaviour of Ni – YSZ nanocomposite coatings on superalloy 690 as diffusion barrier coatings for nuclear applications,"Ni-YSZ nanocomposite coatings with different Ni content in the range of 0–50 wt.% were developed on Inconel 690 substrates using an electron beam physical vapour deposition method to optimise the Ni concentration in order to enhance the durability of coatings for nuclear applications. X ray diffraction confirmed the formation of cubic phases of Ni and YSZ in the Ni-YSZ nanocomposite coatings. Increased addition of Ni was found to increase the crystallite size of Ni which resulted in lower strain. FESEM analysis of cross-sectional view of the compositionally graded Ni-YSZ coating with low concentration of Ni showed dense columnar structure and exhibited increased porosity along the columnar boundaries with higher concentration of Ni. FESEM and XRD analyses suggest that the grains of the columnar growth could be along (111) plane of the YSZ phase. The elemental composition of individual layers constituting the compositionally graded Ni-YSZ was confirmed by Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy analysis. The nanoindentation analysis of the as deposited coatings showed an increase in the hardness from 1.7 to 9.1 GPa, reduced Young’s modulus from 48 to 168 GPa, elastic recovery from 15.03% to 32.78% and resistance to plastic deformation from 0.0021 to 0.027 with the increased Ni content. Scratch test confirmed superior adhesion of the Ni-YSZ (50 wt.%: 50 wt.%) nanocomposite coating with the substrate. Also, investigation on the scratch track of Ni-YSZ (50 wt.%:50 wt.%) coating did not reveal chipping or spallation of the coating throughout the scratch track indicating a good adherence of coating with the substrate. The structural and the nanomechanical properties of Ni-YSZ (50 wt.%:50 wt.%) nanocomposite coating suggest that it could be used as diffusion barrier coating in the components of nuclear vitrification furnaces which are operated at higher temperatures.","Dharini, T.;Kuppusami, P.;Panda, Padmalochan;Ramaseshan, R.;Kirubaharan, A.M.

Effect of the interface morphology and initial nanocrack on the fracture property of a ceramic reinforced plasma-sprayed coating,"The introduction of ceramic particles can greatly improve the mechanical properties of plasma-sprayed coatings. The coating morphology obtained during deposition and thermal stress inducement at the ceramic/alloy interfaces affect the initial nanocrack formation and the failure mechanism, which were investigated in this study. Scanning electron microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were used to examine the morphology of the initial nanocracks, the phase composition at the ceramic/alloy interfaces and the fracture characteristics. During plasma spraying, different ceramic particle morphologies resulted in different deposition structures with various curvatures. The fracture results indicated that the interface between two adjacent ceramic particles or areas with small ceramic particles were weak areas. Nanocracks formed at the ceramic/alloy interfaces and then developed along the interface between ceramic particles. The effects of the morphology of ceramic particles on the inducement of thermal stress, the formation and evolution of nanocracks and the fracture characteristics of plasma-sprayed coatings are discussed.","Huang, Taihong;Deng, Chunming;Song, Peng;Lü, Jianguo;Li, Chao;Shu, Yongchun;Sun, Benshuang;Ahmad, Syed Awais;Ji, Qiang;Yi, Jianhong",2020-11-30,Ceramics International,"Ceramic particles,Interface,Nanocracks,Thermal stress,Plasma spray",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.279,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.279
Electrophoretic deposition of carbon nanotubes and bioactive glass particles for bioactive composite coatings,"The production of bioactive coatings consisting of 45S5 Bioglass® and mutli-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) was investigated. In addition to pure Bioglass® coatings, the co-deposition and sequential deposition of Bioglass® particles (size <5μm) and CNTs on stainless steel substrates were carried out in order to fabricate bioactive, nanostructured composite layers. The optimal experimental conditions were determined using well-dispersed suspensions by means of a trial-and-error approach by varying the relevant EPD parameters: applied voltage and deposition time. SEM images demonstrated the successful fabrication of Bioglass®/CNT composites by revealing their morphology and topography. The co-deposition of Bioglass® particles and CNTs resulted in homogenous and dense coatings exhibiting the presence of well-dispersed CNTs placed in-between micron-sized Bioglass® particles. This network of high-strength CNTs embedded in the glass layer could act as reinforcing element leading to higher mechanical stability of the coatings. The coatings obtained by sequential deposition offered a two-dimensional nanostructured fibrous mesh of CNTs covering the Bioglass® layer thus providing a controlled (ordered) nano-topographical surface. This surface nanostructure has the potential to promote the attachment and growth of osteoblast cells and to benefit the formation of bone-like nanosized hydroxyapaptite crystals in contact with body fluids.","Charlotte Schausten, M.;Meng, Decheng;Telle, Rainer;Boccaccini, Aldo R.",2010-01-31,Ceramics International,"Electrophoretic deposition,Carbon nanotubes,Bioactive glass,Biomaterials",10.1016/j.ceramint.2009.09.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2009.09.008
The effect of pulse-reverse electroplating bath temperature on the wear/corrosion response of Ni-Co/tungsten carbide nanocomposite coating during layer deposition,"In this article, the effect of bath temperature during layer deposition on the electrochemical/abrasion responses of Ni-Co/tungsten carbide nanocomposite coating has been investigated. The Ni-Co/tungsten carbide nanocomposite coating was obtained using simultaneous deposition of tungsten carbide nanoparticles in three Ni-Co bath temperatures of 20, 40, and 60 °C. Afterwards, in order to characterize the obtained coatings, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), X-Ray diffraction (XRD), MAP analysis, potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy methods in 3.5 wt% NaCl, and also abrasion test using a pin on disc method were carried out. The results of this study revealed that the deposition obtained from Ni-Co bath contains tungsten carbide nanoparticles and results in strong (200) and hard (111) textures in the coating at different temperatures. Also increasing the bath temperature from 20 to 40 °C results in the absorption of cobalt and tungsten carbide nanoparticles, as well as reducing the nickel content and corrosion resistance in the coating, and on one hand it increases the abrasion resistance of the coating. However, a bath-temperature increase from 40 to 60 °C results in reducing the absorption of cobalt and tungsten carbide nanoparticles, and increasing the nickel content and corrosion resistance in the coating as well as reducing the abrasion resistance of the coating.","Sabzi, M.;Dezfuli⁠, S.

The film was black nickel electrodeposited by diluted nitric acid and then a thin TiO2 layer coating was deposited by Sol-gel process. The microstructure of the film was analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) detector. X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique was used to determine the phases formed in the heterostructured film. Optical properties of the heterostructured film were measured by UV–visible spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) Test. Results showed that the heterostructured NiO-TiO2 films had a cauliflower characteristic and was amorphous crystallographically. The heterostructured films also increased the absorption coefficient of the solar absorber plates up to more than 98% in the visible-ultraviolet range.

Effect of preparation parameters on the properties of hydroxyapatite containing micro-arc oxidation coating on biodegradable ZK60 magnesium alloy,"Recently, micro-arc oxidation (MAO) is intensely studied as a promising surface treatment method for biodegradable magnesium alloys due to the excellent wear resistance and bonding strength of the MAO coating. In order to improve the bioactivity of the coating, hydroxyapatite (HA) nano-particles were added in the MAO electrolyte in the present study to prepare HA containing MAO coatings on the biodegradable ZK60 magnesium alloy. The HA concentration in the electrolyte, the preparation voltage and oxidation time were adjusted to prepare coatings with different morphologies, composition and properties. It was found that the coating was greatly influenced by these three parameters. The immersion test demonstrated that the HA containing MAO coating owned increased bioactivity and long-term protective ability compared with the base coating. A HA containing coating with good combination of corrosion resistance and phase composition could be obtained by properly selecting the above parameters.","Lin, Xiao;Wang, Xin;Tan, Lili;Wan, Peng;Yu, Xiaoming;Li, Qi;Yang, Ke",2014-08-31,Ceramics International,"Biodegradable magnesium,Coating,Micro-arc oxidation,Hydroxyapatite",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.02.104,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.02.104
Template-free synthesis of uniform hollow silica nanoparticles for controllable antireflection coatings,"Antireflection coatings consisting of nanoparticles have promising applications in a wide range of UV optical fields, such as high-power laser systems and space telescopes. However, an open question for these coatings is how to minimize light scattering caused by the nanoparticles. Here, we utilize hollow silica nanoparticles to realize antireflection coatings, which largely diminish light scattering and, hence, exhibit excellent transmission even at UV wavelengths. The hollow silica nanoparticles were synthesized using a template-free approach and then dip coated onto fused silica substrates to form antireflection coatings. The coatings were found to exhibit nearly 100% transmission at any wavelength ranging from the UV to IR bands by variation of the coating thickness. Moreover, the coatings showed relatively high environmental stability because their hollow structures were insensitive to contaminants. This study provides a novel route to fabricate UV antireflection coatings with improved optical properties and good environmental stability, which will help promote the understanding, design and fabrication of optical coatings.","Ye, Longqiang;Li, Lili;Wang, Xuchun;Zhang, Yulu;Yan, Lianghong",2020-04-15,Ceramics International,"Hollow silica nanoparticles,Template-free synthesis,Antireflection coating,Refractive index",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.242,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.242
Biodegradation of hydroxyapatite coated Rex-734 alloy with silver and selenium/chitosan substitutions: In vitro analysis,"Hydroxyapatite (HA) based bioceramic coatings; such as single-HA, double layered with Silver-Ag, Selenium-Se and Chitosan substitutions on Rex-734 alloy were executed by using the sol-gel method. Surface morphologies and adhesion strengths of the obtained coatings were investigated and coating material weight losses and metal ion releases from the substrates were determined in SBF (Simulated Body Fluid) environment. The coatings were characterized by SEM, EDS, XRD and adhesion strengths between the substrate and bioceramic coatings were measured with adhesion tests. SEM analyses revealed that crack-free surface morphologies were obtained in all bioceramic coatings. The coatings were kept in SBF for immersion periods from one to four weeks and the weight loss (%) in coatings and changes in ion release rates were determined. HA/Ag double layered coatings applied on the Rex-734 alloy increased the adhesion strength and accordingly reduced the weight losses (%) of coating materials in SBF. Se/Chitosan double layered coatings were found to decrease the adhesion strength and increase the weight losses (%) in SBF. Additionally, all bioceramic coatings were observed to prevent the elemental ion release by physical barrier effect for the release of metal ions during the four weeks immersion period in SBF.","Aksakal, B.;Say, Y.;Buyukpinar, Ç.;Bakirdere, S.",2017-10-15,Ceramics International,"Hydroxyapatite,Sol-gel coating,Rex-734,Biodegradation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.139,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.139

The effects of Ag layer thickness on the morphology of Ag NPs and performance of Ag/FTO bilayer films were investigated. The annealed Ag/FTO bilayer film with a 5nm-thick Ag layer (Ag5/FTO bilayer film), which was covered with densely distributed 70-nm Ag NPs, possessed a sheet resistance of 5.7Ω/sq that is lower than that of the FTO single-layer film (8.5Ω/sq). The annealed Ag5/FTO bilayer film was selected for further optimization by coating it with sputtered aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) layers. After thermal annealing, the AZO/Ag/FTO trilayer film with a 500nm-thick AZO layer had a figure of merit of 2.97×10−2 Ω−1, which is more than double that of the FTO single-layer film (1.30×10−2 Ω−1). The results indicate that the introduction of Ag NPs and AZO layer can effectively improve the overall photoelectric property of FTO single-layer films.","Ren, Nai-fei;Huang, Li-jing;Zhou, Ming;Li, Bao-jia",2014-07-31,Ceramics International,"Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO),Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs),AZO/Ag/FTO film,Magnetron sputtering,Photoelectric property",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.01.087,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.01.087
A study on the oxidation resistance of electrodeposited and nanostructured YSZ thermal barrier ceramic coatings,"A method is developed to electrodeposit nanostructured yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as thermal barrier ceramic coating on In.738LC Ni base superalloy substrate. The microstructure of the deposit and its oxidation resistance were investigated in detail in the present study. The first step was to applying an incipient conversion coating from an acidic solution in order to improve the coating adhesion. The deposition was performed in an aqueous solution containing yttrium and zirconium soluble salts as well as potassium chloride. Oxidation resistance of the specimens was tested at 1000°C through a cyclic voltammetry method. The surface morphology and cross section of specimens were examined by a scanning electron microscope. According to the obtained results, it was concluded that nanostructured YSZ coating can obtained by electrochemical synthesis with better oxidation resistance compared to the conventional coatings. This was attributed to the formation of the ultrafine and compact structures. Meanwhile, homogenous distribution of micro-pores which was observed within the coating might have also affected the oxidation phenomenon.","Narimani, Neda;Saremi, Mohsen",2015-12-31,Ceramics International,"Yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ),Oxidation resistance,Nanostructured ceramic,Thermal barrier coatings,SEM",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.08.064,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.08.064
Titanium dioxide-reduced graphene oxide thin film for photoelectrochemical water splitting,"The incorporation of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) on a TiO2 surface had been demonstrated to be an effective method to enhance the photoelectrochemical performance. A TiO2–rGO thin film was fabricated by depositing TiO2 on ITO using an aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition method and GO dip-coating, followed by thermal reduction of the GO layer. The fabricated thin film was characterized using XRD and FESEM techniques. The photoelectrotrochemical performance of the TiO2–rGO thin film was investigated under the illumination of simulated solar light. The TiO2–rGO showed a higher photocurrent response (80.2µA) than bare TiO2 (13.1µA). This improved photoelectrochemical performance was due to the rGO, which increased the electron transport and thereby minimized the charge recombination process. The TiO2–rGO thin film showed good stability, even after being subjected to 1000 voltammetric cycles, and the rGO sheets remained adhered to the surface of the TiO2 thin film.","FA, Jumeri;HN, Lim;Z, Zainal;NM, Huang;A, Pandikumar",2014-11-30,Ceramics International,"Graphene,Photoelectrochemistry,Titanium oxide,Thin film,Water splitting",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.06.130,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.06.130
Leakage current and dielectric breakdown in lanthanum doped amorphous aluminum oxide films prepared by sol–gel,"Dielectric Al2−2x La2x O3 (x=0.00, 0.005, 0.02, 0.05, and 0.10) thin films were fabricated on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates by sol–gel spin coating. The surface morphology of Al2−2x La2x O3 thin film was observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy. The chemical state of the lanthanum in aluminum oxide films was analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), indicating that lanthanum reacts with absorbed water to form lanthanum hydroxide. J–E measurements were used to investigate the current conduction mechanism and breakdown behavior. The results show that La doping changes the conduction mechanism and makes influences on leakage current. The dominating conduction process of 10% La doped Al2O3 films turns into the space charge limited current (SCLC) mechanism in the field region ranging from 25 to 150MV/m. The leakage current of the films with 10% La doping decreases by three orders of magnitude from 10−6 to 10−9 at the electric field of 25MV/m. The breakdown strength increases with the increasing content of lanthanum.","Zou, Pei;Yao, Manwen;Chen, Jianwen;Peng, Yong;Yao, Xi",2016-02-15,Ceramics International,"Aluminum oxide film,Leakage current,Lanthanum doping,Dielectric breakdown,MIM capacitors",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.11.084,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.11.084
Corrosion protection of carbon steel by alumina-titania ceramic coatings used for industrial applications,"Alumina ceramic coatings containing 14 and 48 wt% TiO2 were thermally sprayed on carbon steel substrates by oxy-fuel using a neutral and oxidizing flame. The permeation of aggressive ions into these coatings was evaluated at different times and their protective behavior was compared with hard chromium coatings. The results showed that, in the first 24 h, the hard chromium coating was the most protective; however, its ability to protect the substrate substantially decreased after 7 days. On the other hand, a moderate performance was observed at 24 h for the alumina-14 wt% TiO2 coatings that were manufactured using the oxidizing flame, but after 7 days of exposure, these coatings displayed protective properties that exceeded those achieved by the hard chromium coating at 24 h. The other alumina-titania coatings behaved relatively weakly, most likely due to the ease with which the aggressive ions permeated through the pores and cracks of each coating.","Pinzón, Angie Vanessa;Urrego, Karen Julieth;González-Hernández, Andrés;Rincón Ortiz, Mauricio;Vargas Galvis, Fabio",2018-12-01,Ceramics International,"Ceramic coatings,Al2O3-TiO2,Corrosion,Impedance,Flame spray",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.273,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.273
Simulation and characterization of Ni–doped SiC nanocoatings prepared by jet electrodeposition,"Ni–doped SiC nanocoatings were successfully prepared by jet electrodeposition in this paper. Jet fluid process was simulated by using FLUENT software, and the microstructure, corrosion behavior and mechanical properties of the nanocoatings were examined through the use of scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), electrochemical workstation and triboindenter nanomechanical tester. Results indicated that when nozzle diameter was Φ8mm, maximum jet rate and kinetic energy were 113m/s and 543m2/s2, respectively. SEM and XRD results demonstrated that Ni-doped SiC nanocoatings produced at Φ8mm had fine, uniform and smooth microstructure, and average grain diameters of Ni and SiC were 344nm and 75nm, respectively. Among three diameters of nickel nozzles considered, Ni–doped SiC nanocoating produced at Φ8mm had minimum average corrosion current density of 0.66 × 10−4 A/cm2, thereby indicating the best corrosion resistance. Ni–doped SiC nanocoating deposited at a diameter of Φ8mm exhibited the highest nanohardness (~ 33.4GPa) among all three coatings, whereas the coating prepared at Φ4mm had the lowest nanohardness (~ 23.7GPa).","Cui, Wei;Wang, Ke;Xia, Fafeng;Wang, Peter",2018-04-01,Ceramics International,"Ni–doped SiC nanocoating,Jet electrodeposition,Simulation,Characterization,Corrosion resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.189,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.189
Hierarchical architecture of Ti3C2@PDA/NiCo2S4 composite electrode as high-performance supercapacitors,"A novel Ti3C2@PDA/NiCo2S4 composites as high performance supercapacitor electrodes were synthesized by the hydrothermal treatment process. The chemical modification and uniformly coating of Ti3C2 surface by polydopamine (PDA) can prevent the structural collapse and over-oxidation of Ti3C2 during the hydrothermal synthesis of NiCo2S4. Furthermore, the confined-synthesis of smaller NiCo2S4 particles between the Ti3C2 layers, not only prevent the restacking of Ti3C2 that between the adjacent monolayers during cycling, but also afford high surface areas accessible to charge transfer and ion diffusion. Thereby, enhance the electrochemical cycling stability of the Ti3C2@PDA/NiCo2S4 composite. It is significant to explore how NiCo2S4 alters the microstructure, morphology as well as supercapacitors performance of Ti3C2 to tune the microstructure and performance of Ti3C2 by appropriate hydrothermal synthesis strategy. The experimental results exhibit a prominent improvement in the supercapacitor performance, the gravimetric capacitance of Ti3C2@PDA/NiCo2S4 composites achieve as high as 495 F g-1 at 2 mV s-1, which increase the 10 times as compared to the pristine Ti3C2. Furthermore, the cycling stability of the Ti3C2@PDA/NiCo2S4 composites electrode was enhanced significantly by the hierarchical architecture, and showed exceptional capacitance retention (81.16%) even after 3000 cycles. The dramatic improvement in the supercapacitors performance of Ti3C2@PDA/NiCo2S4 electrodes is attributed to impressive conductive matrix Ti3C2, the effective modification of small size Ni2Co2S4, and the strong interfacial interaction between Ti3C2@PDA and NiCo2S4. This study demonstrating its attractive application prospect of Ti3C2 Mxenes modified with bimetallic sulfide as electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors.","Wu, Wenling;Niu, Dongjuan;Zhu, Jianfeng;Gao, Yan;Wei, Dan;Zhao, Chunhui;Wang, Chengwei;Wang, Fen;Wang, Lei;Yang, Liuqing",2019-09-30,Ceramics International,"Ti3C2 Mxenes,NiCo2S4,Confined-synthesis,Electrochemical performance,Supercapacitor",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.149,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.149
Self-organization wear characteristics of MTCVD-TiCN-Al2O3 coated tool against 300M steel,"The chemical thermodynamic of the cutting process was analyzed by Gibbs free energy function method. Tool life, wear characteristics, surface roughness and fractal characteristics of surface profile curves were investigated by high-speed turning of 300M with coated cutting tool. According to the chemical thermodynamic analysis, some products may be generated in this cutting system, which have a positive effect on high-speed cutting, such as TiO2 and SiO2. The reasons for the tool failure involved adhesive wear, abrasive wear, chipping, coating spalling and micro-crack. The self-organization wear characteristics (e.g. oxygen-containing surface layer and secondary structures) of the coated tool were found, which can play the role of protection, lubrication and heat insulation. The formation and disappearance of the self-organization structures affected the size of surface roughness. On the basis of the fractal analysis, a more stable and better machined surface quality was obtained at v c = 300m/min which can be selected for finish machining.","Zheng, Guangming;Cheng, Xiang;Yang, Xianhai;Xu, Rufeng;Zhao, Jun;Zhao, Guoyong",2017-11-30,Ceramics International,"Failure analysis,Interfaces,Wear resistance,TiO2,Cutting tools",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.017
ZrB2–SiC gradient oxidation protective coating for carbon/carbon composites,"To improve the oxidation protective ability of carbon/carbon composites, ZrB2–SiC gradient coating was prepared on the surface of C/C composites by an in-situ reaction method. The ZrB2–SiC gradient coating consisted of an inner ZrB2–SiC layer and an outer ZrB2–SiC–Si coating. The phase composition and microstructures of the multiphase coating were characterized by XRD, EDS and SEM. Results showed that the inner coating is mainly composed of ZrB2 and SiC, while the outer multiphase coating is composed of ZrB2, SiC and Si. The multilayer coating is about 200μm in thickness, which has no penetration crack or big hole. The oxidation behavior of the coated C/C composites at 1773K in air was investigated. Results show that the gradient ZrB2–SiC oxidation protective coating could protect C/C from oxidation for 207h with only (4.56±1.2)×10−3 g/cm2 weight loss, owing to the compound silicate glass layer with the existence of thermally stable phase ZrSiO4.","Ren, Xuanru;Li, Hejun;Chu, Yanhui;Li, Kezhi;Fu, Qiangang",2014-06-30,Ceramics International,"B.

Anatase–rutile transformation of TiO2 sol–gel coatings deposited on different substrates,"Titanium dioxide is widely used in a lot of applications. The properties of TiO2 strongly depend on its phase composition. The transformation temperature between phases is influenced by a lot of factors. One of them is a type of substrate under the TiO2 film. In presented work, thin films of TiO2 were deposited by the sol–gel method on silicon, stainless steel (304L) and Co–Cr–Mo alloy (Vitallium). The process of anatase–rutile phase transformation was investigated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) studies of deposited coatings. The results were compared with anatase–rutile transformations temperature of TiO2 powders obtained by analogous sol–gel process. The temperature of anatase–rutile phase transformation changed in the range of 700–1000°C and strongly depends on a kind of substrate. It was found that anatase–rutile transformation of TiO2 coating proceeded at a higher temperature than rutilization of titania powders.","Miszczak, Sebastian;Pietrzyk, Bożena",2015-07-31,Ceramics International,"Titania,Anatase,Rutile,Crystallization,Sol–gel",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.02.066,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.02.066
"Preparation, characterization and oxidation behavior of CeO2-gradient NiCrAlY coatings applied by HVOF thermal spraying process","Conventional and CeO2-gradient NiCrAlY coatings (0.5–2.0 wt% of nano-CeO2 from the inner layer to layers adjacent to the outer surface) were produced by the high-velocity oxy-fuel spraying (HVOF) process. Microstructural characteristics, phases analysis and high-temperature oxidation behavior of the functionally graded (FG) NiCrAlY/nano-CeO2 coatings were investigated and compared with those monolayer (ML) NiCrAlY coatings with without CeO2 nanoparticles. The microstructure of the ML- and FG-coatings, as well as processed powders, were characterized using a transmission electron microscope (TEM), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), microhardness testing and Raman spectroscopy. On account of the calculation of oxidation behavior of the coating, the ML- and FG-coatings were exposed to laboratory's air at 1000 °C up to 100 h (short-term exposure) and 5000 h (long-term exposure) and moreover, the weight gain versus oxidation time and oxide growth rate were subsequently examined. Obtained results indicated that FG-NiCrAlY/nano-CeO2 coating had a better oxidation resistance as well as a lower oxide growth rate compared to the rest of the ML-coatings. In addition, increasing oxidation resistance of FG-NiCrAlY/nano-CeO2 coating can be attributed by controlling Al and O diffusion due to the formation of relatively thin, dense, and sticky Al2O3 oxide scale. Besides, all cases of the oxidized ML- and FG-coatings had a parabolic rate behavior owing to their diffusion-controlled oxidation under short- and long-term oxidation tests.","Ghadami, F.;Sabour Rouh Aghdam, A.;Ghadami, S.",2020-08-15,Ceramics International,"FG-NiCrAlY/nano-CeO2 coating,Structural characteristics,Oxidation behavior,Diffusion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.155,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.155
Incorporation of Y2O3 nanoparticles and glycerol as an appropriate approach for corrosion resistance improvement of Ni-Fe alloy coatings,"Ni-Fe coatings have been recently developed to use for various industrial applications; however, their relatively inappropriate corrosion resistance have restricted their beneficial usage. This study aims to improve the corrosion-resistance of Ni-Fe coatings through incorporation of Y2O3 nanoparticles as reinforcing agent accompanied by glycerol as an electrolyte additive. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to assess the surface morphology, chemical composition, and constituent phases, respectively. Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), Tafel polarization, and open circuit potential (OCP) measurements were employed to study the corrosion behavior of the fabricated coatings. Results proved that the corrosion resistance of the coatings improves with incorporation of Y2O3 nanoparticles. Ni-Fe-4 g/L Y2O3 coating exhibits the best corrosion behavior due to its higher Y2O3 content. Altogether, results demonstrated that the volume fraction of the Y2O3 is the governing factor exerting a determining role in the corrosion behavior of the coatings.","Safavi, Mir Saman;Babaei, Farid;Ansarian, Alireza;Ahadzadeh, Iraj",2019-06-01,Ceramics International,"Ni-Fe alloy coatings,Y2O3 nanoparticles,Glycerol,Electrodeposition,Corrosion behavior",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.177,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.177
Fabrication and corrosion resistance of calcium phosphate glass-ceramic coated Mg alloy via a PEG assisted sol–gel method,"To slow down the initial biodegradation rate of magnesium (Mg) alloy, crack-free CaO–P2O5–SrO–Na2O glass-ceramic coatings (CaPs) were synthesized using polyethylene glycol (PEG) assisted sol–gel method followed by a heat-treatment at 400°C. The thermal behaviors of the synthesized glass-ceramics were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric (DSC/TG). The glass transition temperature (T g ) of calcium phosphate system shifted to a lower temperature (~226°C) due to the addition of PEG, which promoted the crystal nuclei formation, thereafter induced a great amount of Ca2P2O7 at a relatively low temperature. The effects of PEG addition on the corrosion behaviors of the coated Mg alloys were investigated by the electrochemical measurements and immersion tests in simulated body fluid (SBF). It was found that the coatings comprised of massive crystalline phases could slow down the degradation rate and decrease the mass loss of the Mg alloy substrates from 78.04% to 3.81% in the 7th day test, showing a better anti-corrosion property than that of the calcium phosphate coatings without the addition of PEG. Moreover, protection effect of PEG assisted synthesis of calcium phosphate coating gradually declined after the initial soaking time, which was confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. These results implied that crystallization induced by PEG addition would affect the corrosion resistance of the coated Mg alloy and subsequently influence the degradation rate.","Wang, Xuexin;Cai, Shu;Liu, Tielong;Ren, Mengguo;Huang, Kai;Zhang, Ruiyue;Zhao, Huan",2014-03-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Development and testing of carbon-bonded alumina foam filters for continuous casting of steel,"Carbon-bonded alumina filters with special design for continuous casting were produced by the replication technique using different coating procedures. The filters were investigated regarding filter strut diameter, porosity and cold crushing strength. The potential filter capacity and the mechanical load expected during the immersion in a continuous casting tundish were calculated. The best compromise between mechanical strength and structural features was achieved by combining the advantages of centrifugation, dip coating and spray coating. This filter type was analyzed by computed tomography and withstood the contact with molten steel in a casting test. After melt contact, the filter material exhibited near-surface decarburization and alumina-based in-situ layer formation. The observed layers were more pronounced in zones with potentially lower melt flow velocity. The results of the study indicated that the produced filters are able to withstand the severe conditions in continuous casting.","Wetzig, Tony;Luchini, Bruno;Dudczig, Steffen;Hubálková, Jana;Aneziris, Christos G.",2018-10-15,Ceramics International,"Continuous casting,Steel,Carbon-bonded alumina,Ceramic foam filter",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.022
Preparation of feedstocks from nano/submicron-sized TiO2 particles to obtain photocatalytic coatings by atmospheric plasma spraying,"Atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) has been proved useful in obtaining TiO2 coatings with effective photocatalytic activity. However, the influence of feedstock characteristics on photocatalytic activity has hardly been addressed. This study was undertaken to prepare TiO2 photocatalytic coatings by APS from different feedstocks. The feedstocks were obtained by spray drying suspensions of a nano- and a submicron-sized TiO2 powder, with different solids contents and/or ratios of the nano- to submicron-sized particles. All the resulting powders were fully characterised to assess their suitability for use in APS processes. Feedstock powders were then deposited on steel coupons by APS using hydrogen or helium as secondary plasma gas. Coating microstructure and phase composition were characterised. Coating photocatalytic activity was determined by measuring the degradation of methylene blue dye in an aqueous solution. Powder characterisation showed that all feedstocks met plasma spray operation requirements with regard to agglomerate size distribution and density, as well as to powder flowability. Optimum agglomerate density was obtained when a well-balanced mixture of nano- and submicron-sized particles was used. All coatings displayed a bimodal microstructure with partially melted agglomerates that retained the initial nano- or submicron-sized structure and composition (anatase phase) of the feedstock, surrounded by a fully melted matrix mainly formed by rutile. As expected, coating porosity as well as the amount of partially melted areas depended strongly on plasma spray conditions and on feedstock characteristics. With regard to photocatalytic activity, a reasonably good fit of a first-order kinetic model to the experimental data was found for all coatings. The kinetic constants obtained displayed higher values than those of a commercial sol–gel coating. The values of these constants were related to feedstock characteristics as well as to plasma spraying conditions on the basis of anatase content. The contribution of other factors to the resulting coating surface is also discussed.","Bordes, Mari Carmen;Vicent, Mónica;Moreno, Arnaldo;López, Verónica;Moreno, Rodrigo;Salvador, Marí;a Dolores;Benavente, Rut;Sánchez, Enrique",2014-12-31,Ceramics International,"D.

Effect of BN/SiC interfacial coatings on the tensile properties of SiC/SiC minicomposites fabricated by PIP,"Boron nitride and silicon carbide interfacial coatings were deposited by chemical vapor infiltration to prepare SiC/SiC minicomposites by the precursor infiltration and pyrolysis process. The tensile properties of the SiC/SiC minicomposites were assessed by the acoustic emission method. A single-layered BN coating increased the strength of the uncoated minicomposite from 416.4 MPa to 478.6 MPa, while the strengths of the BN/SiC-1 and BN/SiC-2 samples with a double-layered coating were 582.3 and 638.1 MPa, respectively. The total thickness of the BN/SiC-2 coating was the same as that of BN/SiC-1, while the BN/SiC-2 sample had a thicker BN layer. Besides the release of residual stress and elastic deformation stages, the stress-strain curve of minicomposite with interfacial coating contains a non-linear stage corresponding to the matrix crack generation, propagation, and deflection. Moreover, minimal fiber debonding was observed in the uncoated minicomposite, whereas fiber debonding of BN and BN/SiC-1 minicomposites occurred at the interface between the BN coating and fibers. In the double-layered BN/SiC-2 minicomposites, following matrix crack generation and propagation into the BN coating, cracks deflected both between the sublayers and at the interface between BN and fibers, where the debonding occurred.","Dai, Jianwei;Wang, Yiguang;Xu, Zhenhua;Mu, Rende;Liu, Wei;He, Limin",2020-11-30,Ceramics International,"Ceramic matrix composites,Interfacial coating,Precursor infiltration and pyrolysis,Chemical vapor infiltration,Tensile properties,Fracture mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.292,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.292
Effects of chemical additives on high-field electromechanical properties of PMN–PT–BT ceramics,"A chemical additive method using sol–gel reactions was used to modify the composition and resultant properties of a commercially available 0.96(0.91Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3–0.09PbTiO3)–0.04 BaTiO3 (PMN–PT–BT) ceramic. Without an additional ball-mixing process, several combinations of minor additives such as Fe, Ba, Sr, Zn, and Ti were incorporated by the chemical method. Weak- and high-field characteristics including dielectric properties, induced strain and polarization, and associated hystereses were evaluated for the samples sintered at 1200°C for 4h. All properties were found to depend on the chemical additives and temperature. Especially, the temperature dependence of high-field characteristics revealed different behavior from that reported for conventionally prepared samples. For example, the samples containing 0.5wt.% SrO, 0.5wt.% ZnO, and 0.5wt.% TiO2 did not exhibit a transition to piezoelectric behavior at the temperature expected from the dielectric measurements. Overall, the coating process has been successfully used to modify, and in some cases, enhance the high-field characteristics of PMN-based ceramics for electromechanical uses.","Cho, Yong S.;Yoon, Chang H.;Pilgrim, Steven M.",2005-12-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Effect of GNPs content on thermal and mechanical properties of a novel hybrid Cu-Al2O3/GNPs coated Ag nanocomposite,"Hybrid Cu-Al2O3/GNPs coated Ag nanocomposites with GNPs content of 0%, 0.3%, 0.6%, 0.9% and 1.2% were successfully manufactured with improved mechanical and good electrical and thermal properties. Compressive strength, hardness, thermal and electrical properties were studied. The results indicated that compressive strength and hardness are significantly improved by increasing GNPs achieving 88.1% and 55.2% improvement, respectively. This improvement is attributed to the remarkable mechanical strength of GNPs, the reduction of grain size and the precipitation of GNPs on the grain boundaries of Cu. However, the coefficient of thermal expansion and electrical conductivity were reduced. Interestingly, increasing GNPs content has almost negligible effect of the thermal conductivity, at which the thermal conductivity is slightly reduced by a factor of 5% only by increasing GNPs content to 1.2%. These results highlight the advantage of reinforcing Cu-Al2O3 nanocomposites by GNPs coated Ag for manufacturing hybrid nanocomposite with improved mechanical properties and good thermal conductivity.","Wagih, A.;Abu-Oqail, A.;Fathy, A.",2019-01-31,Ceramics International,"Hybrid Cu-Al2O3/GNPs nanocomposites,Electro-less coating,Mechanical properties,Thermal conductivity,Electrical resistivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.001
Processing and characterization of sol–gel titania membranes,"In this work we present a structural characterization of sol–gel titania membranes obtained in both supported and unsupported forms. We used two commercial grade alumina supports obtained from Whatman and Rojan Advanced Ceramics. The unsupported membranes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TG), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), nitrogen sorption, and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). Morphological studies were performed in both supported and unsupported membranes using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). In order to evaluate the performance of the supported membranes, single-gas permeation experiments were carried out at room temperature with nitrogen, helium, and carbon dioxide. We concluded from nitrogen sorption experiments that increasing the membrane heat treatment temperature leads to samples with lower specific surface areas and greater pore sizes. Close packed titania particles of uniform size were observed in SEM micrographs of unsupported membranes. The SEM analyses also revealed the presence of titania coatings on supported membranes. Some of the obtained membranes showed a separation capacity for He/CO2 and He/N2 larger than that expected for the Knudsen mechanism in the investigated pressure range. However, a good part of the analyzed samples showed an improvement of their separation capacity with increasing the feed pressure.","Caldeira, Lecino;Vasconcelos, Daniela C.L.;Nunes, Eduardo H.M.;Costa, Vilma C.;Musse, Ana P.;Hatimondi, Sueli A.;Nascimento, Jaílton F.;Grava, Wilson;Vasconcelos, Wander L.",2012-05-31,Ceramics International,"E.

Biocompatibility was studied using NIH-3T3-cells (mouse embryonic fibroblast) and >70% viability was found. These results open up the possibility of using these materials in large panoply in orthopaedics, dentistry and other hard tissue replacement applications where biofunctional, structural and antimicrobial properties are required.","Esteban-Tejeda, Leticia;Smirnov, Antón;Prado, Catuxa;Moya, José S.;Torrecillas, Ramón;Bartolomé, José F.",2016-05-01,Ceramics International,"Biocermets,Antimicrobial coating,Biocompatible coating,Bactericidal glass coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.01.090,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.01.090
Oxidation-dominated wear behaviors of carbide-based cermets: A comparison between WC-WB-Co and Cr3C2-NiCr coatings,"A WC-40WB-12Co coating has been developed and demonstrated to have comparable oxidation resistance, remarkably enhanced hardness (over 2 times higher) and improved wear resistance (2–4 times higher) than the widely used Cr3C2-25NiCr coating at elevated temperatures. Wear failure of Cr3C2-NiCr coating was dominated by severe subsurface cracking due to oxidation and its poor high-temperature mechanical properties. By contrast, in the WC-WB-Co coating, the thin oxide scale formed on the surface increased lubrication and hindered further oxidation. The WC-WB-Co coating provided strong mechanical support for the oxide layer. The coating thereby achieved an outstanding high-temperature wear performance. Based on detailed comparisons, the wear mechanisms of these carbide-based cermet coatings at elevated temperatures were proposed.","Wang, Haibin;Yan, Xifeng;Zhang, Hannah;Gee, Mark;Zhao, Chong;Liu, Xuemei;Song, Xiaoyan",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"WB,Cermet coating,Oxide layer,Hardness,High temperature wear resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.113,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.113
"Structure and properties of PVD TiAlN and TiAlN/CrAlN coated Ti(C, N)-based cermets","Ti(C, N)-based cermets were coated with TiAlN and TiAlN/CrAlN films by physical vapor deposition. The cross-sectional morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the adhesive strength was evaluated by the scratch test. Cutting tests on the coated cermets were conducted on the different cutting conditions. The cutting performance and wear mechanism were analyzed with SEM and EDS. It is found that TiAlN coating has a better adhesion to the cermet substrate. The coated cermet inserts show better wear resistance than the uncoated ones. By contrast, the TiAlN coating suffers a slight abrasive flank wear. However, the TiAlN/CrAlN coating show more severe adhesive flank wear because of the Cr interdiffusion between the inserts and the workpiece. In addition, TiAlN coating is weak in resisting against oxidation wear, while the TiAlN/CrAlN coating has an excellent resistance to oxidation.","Yang, Wei;Xiong, Ji;Guo, Zhixing;Du, Hao;Yang, Tianen;Tang, Jun;Wen, Bin",2017-02-01,Ceramics International,"Films,Ti(C, N)-based cermet,Mechanical properties,Cutting tools",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.151,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.151
Carbon nanotube-metal oxide nanocomposite gas sensing mechanism assessed via NO2 adsorption on n-WO3/p-MWCNT nanocomposites,"A series of WO3/multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) nanocomposite sensors was fabricated by bar-coating slurries using different ratios of MWCNTs to WO3 nanoparticles. The morphology, composition, and structure of the fabricated nanocomposites were examined using electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, ultraviolet and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements, with the aim of completely identifying the physical and electronic structures of the nanocomposites. The effects of the different ratios of the nanocomposites on the electrical conductance and NO2 gas sensing properties were examined and compared with the morphological investigation results. The synergetic properties of the nanocomposite sensors were a result of the combined effect of low-doped semiconducting WO3 and metallic MWCNTs. Because nanoscale sensors exhibit a maximal response on the scale of their depletion depth, individual components with conductivities that are either too low or too high cannot meet the condition. Meanwhile, their mixture can establish the required condition for the maximal response which appears as a synergetic effect. Based on this effect, the optimal nanocomposite sensor (0.5 wt% MWCNT) showed a response of ~18 for 5 ppm NO2 at 150 °C with short response/recovery times (~87 s /~300 s). The synergetic effect in nanocomposite sensors cannot be explained by the interfacial Schottky barrier model, which has been used for sensors of agglomerated particles.","Hung, Nguyen Manh;Chinh, Nguyen Duc;Nguyen, Tien Dai;Kim, Eui Tae;Choi, GyuSeok;Kim, Chunjoong;Kim, Dojin",2020-12-15,Ceramics International,"WO3/MWCNT composite,NO2 detection,Nano sensor",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.097,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.097
Effect of process parameters on behaviour of zeolite coatings obtained by hydrothermal direct synthesis on aluminium support,"This work reports the results of an experiment study on anti-corrosion coatings obtained by the direct growth of zeolite Y films on aluminium substrates by an amine-modified hydrothermal synthesis. In particular, the effect of the TEA (triethanolamine) presence was evaluated in terms of coating performances by varying synthesis times and drying temperatures. The morphological analysis showed that the films were homogeneous and compact up to 120μm in thickness. Peel tests confirmed the good adhesive properties of all kinds of investigated coatings. In the end, electrochemical tests, carried out in 3.5% NaCl and in Ca(OH)2 saturated solution, showed good barrier properties offered by this type of coating. Low drying temperature allowed to keep TEA entrapped in the zeolite structure so that it greatly influenced corrosion protection behaviour.","Calabrese, L.;Bonaccorsi, L.;Pietro, D.

Enhanced electrochemical energy storage properties of carbon coated Co3O4 nanoparticles-reduced graphene oxide ternary nano-hybrids,"In this article, we have synthesized carbon-coated cobalt oxide nanoparticles (NPs) and their nanocomposite with reduced graphene oxide (C@Co3O4/r-GO) via chemical and ultrasonication techniques. The observed higher electrical conductivity (1.4 × 10−3 S/m) of the nanocomposite than the pristine NPs (1.9 × 10−8 S/m) was due to the combined effect of the carbon-coating and r-GO nanosheets. The higher specific surface area (118 m2/g) of the nanocomposite was due to the relived agglomeration of the NPs via the carbon-coating and r-GO matrix. The nanocomposite based electrode shows exceptional gravimetric capacitance of 674 F/g at 1 A/g and loses just 18% of its initial capacitance after 103 charges/discharge cycles. The superior electrochemical performance of the nanocomposite was due to its higher surface area and synergistic improvements between carbon-coated NPs and highly conductive r-GO nanosheets. In the nanocomposite, the r-GO nanosheets play a double role to increase the energy storage properties. For example, the r-GO sheets acted as a capacitive supplement as well as a conductive matrix for a speedy redox reaction. Highly conductive nanocomposite also showed lower charge transfer resistance (Rct ~ 12.78 Ω) during the electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) tests that further facilitated the redox reaction to achieve higher pseudocapacitance. The observed electrical and electrochemical results demonstrate the potential of the C@Co3O4/r-GO nanocomposite for hybrid supercapacitors.","Aadil, Muhammad;Zulfiqar, Sonia;Sabeeh, Humera;Warsi, Muhammad Farooq;Shahid, Muhammad;Alsafari, Ibrahim A.;Shakir, Imran",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"Electrical conductivity,Gravimetric capacitance,Specific surface area,Hybrid supercapacitors,Pseudocapacitance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.090,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.090
Influence of the coating preparation method and of nanosilica addition on the bonding character of Si3N4 layer on a silica crucible,"An improved preparation method of coating, by directly brushing a Si3N4 slurry with nanosilica on a green body, was successfully practiced to increase the binding strength and to prevent shedding of the coating from the crucible sidewall during the directional solidification of polycrystalline silicon. Two types of coatings were prepared: a pure Si3N4 coating achieved by brushing the slurry on a sintered silica substrate, which is a standard process in industrial production, and Si3N4 coatings with different nanosilica contents applied to the green silica substrate. The properties of two types of coatings such as slurry permeation, the binding strength with substrate, and the related binding mechanisms, were discussed. The results showed that the permeation ability of the slurry to the silica substrate was an important factor for the binding strength, and the addition of an appropriate amount of nanosilica to the slurry with green silica as the substrate was an effective way to promote the permeation ability. After heat treatment at 1200°C in air and 1500°C in an argon atmosphere, the Si3N4 coating with 2.8wt% nanosilica brushed on a green silica substrate exhibited the highest binding strengths of 0.33MPa and 0.75MPa, respectively. Furthermore, the introduction of nanosilica increased the coating density which is conducive to reducing the wetting kinetics of liquid silicon.","Gong, Xiaoxiao;Du, Haiyan;Zhang, Xiaoyan;Hu, Xiaoxia;Zhang, Dingyin",2014-06-30,Ceramics International,"Si3N4 coating,Nanosilica,Permeation,Wetting kinetics,Binding strength",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.12.104,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.12.104
Nanometre pyroxenic glass-ceramics prepared by crystallization of Saudi basalt glass,"Glass from the melting of basaltic rocks has many technological applications. Crystallization of basaltic glass from the northern Harrat area in the temperature range of 800–1000 °C gave augitic pyroxene as the major phase with small amounts of olivine, haematite and magnetite. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) indicated that the crystallization occurred within 810–900 °C, and partial melting occurred near 1150 °C. The microcrystalline structure shows nanospheres 10–100 nm in diameter from the augitic phase in all the crystalline samples, and the nanospheres may include small amounts of olivine, haematite and magnetite. The dilatometer showed that the glass-transition temperature is 650 °C. The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the glass-ceramic was between 70.84 and 79.91 × 10−7 °C−1. Additionally, the Vickers microhardness and density values of the basaltic glass-ceramic were within 718–800 kg/mm2 and 2.88–2.98 g/cc, respectively. Generally, the samples resistance to acidic solutions is lower than in alkaline solutions. A thin metallic film on the glass-ceramic surface was obtained after heat treatment at 1000 °C due to the oxidation of iron on the surface. However, the present basaltic glass can be used in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) as a sealant between connectors and fuel cells and as coatings for some metals.","Abu Safiah, Mamdouh O.;Hamzawy, Esmat M.A.",2019-03-31,Ceramics International,"Basalt glass-ceramic,Pyroxene,Nanostructure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.128,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.128
Anti-oxidation performance of carbon aerogel composites with SiCO ceramic inner coating,"To improve the oxidative-resistant ability of carbon fibre-reinforced carbon aerogel composites (C/CAs), C/CAs were impregnated with a silicon oxycarbide (SiCO) precursor sol several times. After gelating, aging, solvent exchanging, ambient drying, and pyrolyzing, the SiCO precursor sol infiltrated the nanoporous C/CA, and anti-oxidation carbon aerogel composites with a SiCO ceramic inner coating (C/CA-SiCO) were prepared. It was found that the density of the material increases with the number of times that impregnation and pyrolysis were carried out. The mechanical properties and the anti-oxidant performance were significantly improved after the deposition with different numbers of the SiCO coating cycles. The bending strength increased from 2.2 MPa to 10.8–32.3 MPa and the compressive strength (10%ε) increased from 0.4 MPa to 3.6–44.4 MPa. The weight loss for the as-prepared composites after heating at 1600 °C for 60 min in air was only 7.6%, and the in-plane shrinkage was less than 2%. Additionally, after the oxidation resistance test, the surface of the C/CA-SiCO had abundant β-SiO2 crystalline, whereas its inner region of the composite remained amorphous.","Li, Xiafei;Feng, Junzong;Jiang, Yonggang;Li, Liangjun;Feng, Jian",2019-06-01,Ceramics International,"Carbon aerogel composites,SiCO sol,Microstructure,Mechanical property,Anti-oxidation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.169,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.169
PVD-CrAlN and TiAlN coated Si3N4 ceramic cutting inserts-2. High speed face milling performance and wear mechanism study,"In the authors’ prior works, the microstructure, turning cutting performance and wear mechanisms of PVD-CrAlN and TiAlN coated silicon nitride cutting inserts on turning of gray iron were studied. In the present work, based on the authors’ former study, the effects of the cutting speed on tool life, wear mechanism and surface quality of the workpieces were studied through high speed face milling tests. The uncoated, CrAlN and TiAlN coated cutting inserts were conducted by high speed face milling of gray iron at various cutting speeds of 600m/min~1500m/min. The results displayed that during high speed face milling, the tool life of the PVD coated Si3N4 cutting inserts decreased as the cutting speed increased. When the cutting speed reached a certain value, the tool life increased with the cutting speed increasing. During high speed face milling, no spallation failure happened to both CrAlN and TiAlN coatings, and the coatings could protect the insert substrates effectively under various cutting speeds, improving the tool life of the uncoated cutting inserts by 138–150% and 32–65%, respectively. The wear mechanisms of all three kinds of the cutting inserts by face milling of gray iron under various cutting speed were the same. The only difference was that as the cutting speed increased, the adhesive wear of the inserts increased significantly. During high speed face milling of gray iron with three kinds of inserts, the alteration relationship of machining quality with the cutting speed was similar to the tool life with the cutting speed relationship. Furthermore, when high speed face milling of gray iron was conducted, CrAlN coated Si3N4 cutting inserts displayed the best machining quality, followed by TiAlN coated and the uncoated inserts, respectively.","Liu, Wei;Chu, Quanquan;Zeng, Junjie;He, Rongxuan;Wu, Haidong;Wu, Ziwei;Wu, Shanghua",2017-08-15,Ceramics International,"C.

"Mechanical, structural and oxidation resistance enhancement of carbon foam by in situ grown SiC nanowires","A method for processing carbon foams containing both silicon carbide (SiC) nanowires and bulk SiC and silicon nitride (Si3N4) phases has been developed by reaction of powder mixtures containing precursors for carbon, sacrificial template, silicon (Si), short carbon fibers (SCF) and activated carbon (AC). In situ growth of Si nanowires during pyrolysis of the foam at 1000°C under N2 changed the foam׳s microstructure by covering the porous skeleton inside and out. In situ-grown SiC nanowires were found smoothly curved with diameters ranging around two main modes at 30 and 500nm while their lengths were up to several tens of micrometers. SCF were found effectively mixed and well-bonded to pore walls. Following density, porosity and pore size distribution analyses, the heat-treated (HT) foam was densified using a chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) process. Thereafter, density increased from 0.62 to 1.30g/cm3 while flexural strength increased from 29.3 to 49.1MPa. The latter increase was attributed to the densification process as well as to low surface defects, presence of SCF and coating, by SiC nanowires, of the entire SiC matrix porous structure. The foam׳s oxidation resistance improved significantly from 58 to 84wt% residual mass of the heat treated and densified sample. The growth mechanism of Si nanowires was supported by the vapor–liquid–solid mechanism developed under pyrolysis conditions of novolac and reducing environment of coal cover.","Mei, Hui;Farhan, Shameel;Han, Daoyang;Liu, Guanxi;Wang, Zhao;Zhao, Guoke",2016-03-31,Ceramics International,"Carbon foams,Pyrolysis,SiC nanowires,In situ growth,Porosity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.11.141,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.11.141
Three-dimensional coating of porous zein/PLLA coaxial nanofiber membranes on surfaces of calcium phosphate cement,"Calcium phosphate cement (CPC) is an ideal artificial bone material used widely in hard tissue regeneration due to its excellent physical and chemical performance. However, CPCs are not able to match the high rate of new bone tissue growth during initial implantation given its poor degradability and low biological compatibility, leading to their limited clinical application. To overcome these limitations, we developed a self-made electrospinning auxiliary receiver to obtain a three dimensional membrane coating of porous zein/PLLA coaxial nanofibers on CPC surfaces. To show the feasibility of the composite material for hard tissue regeneration, it was characterized by SEM, porosity, hydrophilicity, mechanical properties, FTIR spectroscopy, and in vitro cell culture where the composite material showed improved induction of tissue regeneration.","Zhang, Mei;Zeng, Jiehui;Hu, Liru;Liu, Guangchen;Ma, Yali;Tang, Yajun;Sun, Dahui",2017-10-01,Ceramics International,"Three-dimensional coating,Porosity,Electrospinning,Zein,Calcium phosphate cement",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.147,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.147
"Residual stress and microstructure effects on mechanical, tribological and electrical properties of TiN coatings on 304 stainless steel","Mechanical, tribological and electrical properties of TiN coatings on 304 stainless steel were investigated and the effects of microstructure and residual stress on these properties were studied. Microstructure, surface roughness, hardness and preferred orientation of the coatings were investigated by AFM, SEM, nanoindentation and XRD. Residual stress of the coatings was designed and controlled in a relatively narrow range successfully using negative bias voltage based on the film thickness effect on residual stress. Residual stress was investigated by grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction using the optimized cos2 α sin2 ψ method. Friction behavior and wear characteristics were evaluated using a tribometer. The results indicate a great influence of microstructure and residual stress on the properties and service behavior of TiN coatings. Based on the experimental findings, an intermediate residual stress and proper microstructure are of vital importance to achieve better performance of coatings during service.","Xi, Yeting;Bai, Yanyun;Gao, Kewei;Pang, Xiaolu;Yang, Huisheng;Yan, Luchun;Volinsky, Alex A.",2018-09-30,Ceramics International,"Residual stress,Mechanical properties,Tribology,Electrical resistivity,Ceramic coatings,Mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.266,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.266
Deposition of thin ultrafiltration membranes on commercial SiC microfiltration tubes,"Porous SiC based materials present high mechanical, chemical and thermal robustness, and thus have been largely applied to water-filtration technologies. In this study, commercial SiC microfiltration tubes with nominal pore size of 0.04μm were used as carrier for depositing thin aluminum oxide (Al2O3) ultrafiltration membranes. These ultrafiltration membranes were obtained by coating, drying and calcination of a colloidal suspension of boehmite particles. After calcination, the membrane material consisted of nanosized γ-Al2O3 crystallites and had a narrow pore size distribution with average pore size of 5.5nm. Membrane thickness was tuned by repeating the coating of boehmite sol. By doing so, we were able to reduce the defect density on the membrane surface, as evidenced by SEM analysis and by the significant reduction of water permeance after depositing the second γ-Al2O3 layer. After five times coating, a 5.6µm thick γ-Al2O3 layer was obtained. This membrane shows retention of ~75% for polyethylene glycol molecules with M n of 8 and 35kDa, indicating that, despite their intrinsic surface roughness, commercial SiC microfiltration tubes can be applied as carrier for thin ultrafiltration membranes. This work also indicates that an improvement of the commercial SiC support surface smoothness may greatly enhance permeance and selectivity of γ-Al2O3 ultrafiltration membranes by allowing the deposition of thinner defect-free layers.","Facciotti, Marco;Boffa, Vittorio;Magnacca, Giuliana;Jørgensen, Lars Bjerg;Kristensen, Peter Kjær;Farsi, Ali;König, Katja;Christensen, Morten Lykkegaard;Yue, Yuanzheng",2014-03-31,Ceramics International,"Silicon carbide,Aluminum oxide,Ultrafiltration,Sol–gel",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.09.107,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.09.107
Enhanced electrochemical performance of Al(NO3)3 and NH4H2PO4 co-modified Li1.11(Ni0.19Co0.07Mn0.6)O2,"Commercial applications of layered Li-excess cathode materials with high energy density are seriously challenged owing to their low initial Coulombic efficiency, insufficient capacity retention and voltage fading during cycling. To overcome these defects, here a facile wet chemical method is employed to obtain a modified material, which consists of a Li1.11(Ni0.19Co0.07Mn0.6)O2 cathode material in conjunction with spinel interphase and an external amorphous Al2O3 coating layer. Exhaustive characterizations of the samples before and after co-modification with Al(NO3)3 and NH4H2PO4, using X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscope, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy, exhibit the variations on the surface structure and chemical constituent. The formed spinel phases coordinated with Al2O3 coating are not only to facilitate the transportation of Li ions but also to mitigate the structural deterioration and curb the side reactions. Thus, the co-modified sample manifests a higher reversible capacity of 289.0 mAh g−1 (0.1C, 2.0 V–4.8 V), improved initial Coulombic efficiency (91.4%), excellent high-rate performance, better cyclic stability, as well as less voltage attenuation.","Qiu, Yechao;Peng, Manxin;Xu, Yabin;Zhang, Meixia;Yi, Li;Liang, Kui",2020-05-31,Ceramics International,"Li1.11(Ni0.19Co0.07Mn0.6)O2,Co-modification,Spinel-like phase,Electrochemical performance,Lithium-ion batteries",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.207,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.207
Characterization of indium tin oxide (ITO) thin films prepared by a sol–gel spin coating process,"Indium tin oxide (ITO) thin films were prepared by a sol–gel spin coating method, fired, and then annealed in the temperature range of 450–600°. The XRD patterns of the thin films indicated the main peak of the (222) plane and showed a higher degree of crystallinity with an increase in the annealing temperature. Upon annealing the films at 500 and 600°, two binding energy levels of Sn4+ ion of 486.9eV and 486.6eV, respectively, were measured in the XPS spectra. The ITO film that was annealed at 600° contained two oxidation states of Sn, Sn2+ and Sn4+, and it had a higher sheet resistance based on a rather low doping concentration of Sn4+. The film that was annealed at 500° and subsequently treated with 0.1N HCl solution for 40s showed a sheet resistance of 225Ω/square. The surface treatment by the acidic solution diminished the RMS (root mean square) roughness value and the residual carbon content (XPS peak intensity of carbon) of the ITO films. It seems that the acid-cleaning of the ITO thin films led to a decrease of the surface roughness and sheet resistance.","Cho, Hyun;Yun, Young-Hoon",2011-03-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Influence of Yb Substitution for La on Thermophysical Property of La2AlTaO7 Ceramics,"The (La1−xYbx)2AlTaO7 ceramics were synthesized by pressureless sintering process at 1600°C for 10h in air. The crystal phase, microstructure and thermophysical properties were investigated. Results show that pure (La1−xYbx)2AlTaO7 cermics with single weberite structure are prepared successfully. Owing to the reduction of crystal-lattice tolerance-factor, the thermal conductivity of (La1−xYbx)2AlTaO7 (x>0) ceramics increases with increasing Yb2O3 fraction at identical temperatures, which is lower than that of La2AlTaO7. Due to the relatively high electro-negativity of Yb element, the addition of Yb2O3 increases the thermal expansion coefficient of (La1−xYbx)2AlTaO7 ceramics.","Xiaoge, Chen;Haidong, Li;Hongsong, Zhang;Haoming, Zhang;An, Tang;Sai, Su",2017-07-31,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,(La1−xYbx)2AlTaO7 ceramics,Thermal conductivity,Thermal expansion coefficient",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.044,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.044
The effect of TiSiN interlayers on the bond strength of ceramic to NiCr and CoCr alloys,"High bonding between the NiCr or CoCr alloys and the ceramic layer is essential for the clinical success of dental prostheses restorations. Aiming to enhance the bond strength between metal and dental ceramics in prosthetic restorations, TiSiN coatings were deposited as interlayers. The coatings were deposited on NiCr and CoCr dental alloys by using the cathodic arc technique at various substrate bias voltage values and characterized in terms of elemental composition, crystalline structure, mechanical properties, surface roughness and contact angle. The bond strength of the metal–ceramic system, with and without TiSiN interlayers, was evaluated by using a three-point bending test. The coatings consisted of nanocrystalline solid solutions (grain sizes of 3.6–4.3nm) with a face-centered cubic structure. The film hardness, ranging from approximately 21–38GPa, was observed to increase with increasing substrate bias, irrespective of the substrate type. The best adhesion values (critical loads of ~54N) were obtained on both substrates for coatings deposited at of −100V bias voltage. The deposition of the TiSiN coatings determined the roughness decrease of both NiCr and CoCr coated alloys. The contact angle measurements indicated a hydrophobic character for the films deposited at bias voltages ranging from −50 to −150V and a hydrophilic character at a bias of −200V. The results indicated that TiSiN coatings improved the bond strength of NiCr–ceramic systems. Based on these results an increase of the clinical service life of the dental restorations having a TiSiN interlayer between the metallic support and the ceramic layer is expected.","Vladescu, A.;Dinu, M.;Braic, M.;Vitelaru, C.;Balaceanu, M.;Tarcolea, M.;Braic, V.;Baciu, F.;Cotrut, C.M.",2015-07-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Fabrication of a SiC/Si/MoSi2 multi-coating on graphite materials by a two-step technique,"A SiC/Si/MoSi2 multi-coating for graphite materials was prepared by a two-step technique. SiC whisker reinforcement coating was produced by pyrolysis of hydrogen silicone oil (H-PSO) at 1600°C, and then the dense coating was formed by embedding with the powder mixture of Si, graphite and MoSi2 at 1600°C in argon atmosphere. The microstructure, thickness, phase and oxidation resistance of the coating were investigated. Research results showed that, the phase of multi-coating was composed of SiC, Si and MoSi2. The thickness of the coating was about 300μm. In addition, the coating combined with matrix well, and surface was continuous and dense. The oxidation pretreatment experiment was carried out in the static air at 1400°C for 4h before thermal failure tests and the specimens had 0.045% weight gain. Subsequent thermal failure tests showed that, the SiC/Si/MoSi2 multi-coating had excellent anti-oxidation property, which could protect graphite materials from oxidation at 1000°C in air for 12h and the corresponding weight loss was below 1wt%. Based on the surface morphology changes, oxidation pretreatment experiment and thermal failure tests enhanced densification of multi-coating and the coating had a certain self-healing ability.","Chen, Yang;Wang, Chengguo;Zhao, Wei;Lu, Wenbo;Chen, Anting;Tan, Tingting",2012-04-30,Ceramics International,"Multi-coating,Oxidation resistance,Graphite materials",10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.10.059,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.10.059
A novel oxidation protective SiC-ZrB2-ZrSi2 coating with mosaic structure for carbon/carbon composites,"An oxidation protective SiC-ZrB2-ZrSi2 coating with mosaic structure was designed to improve the oxidation resistance of carbon/carbon composites by a combined method of hydrothermal electrophoretic deposition and pack cementation. The phase composition, microstructure, thermal shock resistance and oxidation protective ability of the coating were investigated. Results show that the as-prepared SiC-ZrB2-ZrSi2 coating was dense and crack-free. After 50 thermal cycles between 1773 K and room temperature, the weight gain of the coated samples was 15.2 g m−2. The weight loss of the coated samples was only 15.6 g m−2 after oxidation in air at 1773 K for 580 h. The good thermal shock resistance and oxidation protective ability of the coated samples were attributed to the synergetic effect of the glass layer protection, compressive stress restraint and pinning role of ZrSiO4 inlaid phase.","Zhou, Lei;Fu, Qiangang;Huo, Caixia;Wang, Yu;Tong, Mingde",2018-08-15,Ceramics International,"C/C composites,SiC-ZrB2-ZrSi2 coating,Thermal shock resistance,Oxidation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.108,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.108
Investigation of silicon nitride composites toughened with prenitrided TiB2,"Titanium diboride, which was prenitrided in various conditions, was incorporated into Si3N4 before hot pressing. The TiN coating substantially reduced the chemical reaction between TiB2and the Si3N4 matrix. The thickness of TiN coating played an important role in the chemical stability of TiB2 in the Si3N4 matrix and the strain compatibility at interfaces. The fracture toughness of Si3N4 was enhanced 33% with prenitrided-TiB2 particles (20% by volume). Crack deflection was the major toughening mechanism, but the microcracking mechanism could also play a role.","Huang, Jow-Lay;Chen, Shih-Yih",1995-12-31,Ceramics International, ,10.1016/0272-8842(95)95875-I,https://doi.org/10.1016/0272-8842(95)95875-I
"Duplex ceramic coating produced by low temperature thermo-reactive deposition and diffusion on the cold work tool steel substrate: Thermodynamics, kinetics and modeling","Specimens of DIN 100MnCrW4 steel (type O1 tool steel) have been cut and prepared for performing a duplex surface treatment involving nitriding and low temperature vanadium thermo-reactive deposition and diffusion (TRD) technique. The TRD process was performed in a molten salt bath at different temperatures of 575, 650 and 725°C for 1–30h. The treatment formed a vanadium carbonitride coating with the thickness up to 10.5μm on a hardened diffusion zone. Characterizations by means of an optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (SEM–EDS) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) indicated that the compact and dense coating mainly consisted of V(C,N) and V2(C,N) phases. All the growth processes of the formed vanadium carbonitride layer obtained by TRD followed a parabolic kinetics while the calculated activation energy (Q) for the treatment was 181.1kJ/mol. An artificial neural network (ANN) based model for predicting the layer thickness of ceramic coatings was presented. Constructing the model, training, validating and testing of experimental results from 72 different specimens were conducted. The data used as inputs in the proposed model were arranged in a format of five parameters that comprised of “pre-nitriding time”, “ferro-vanadium particle size”, “ferro-vanadium weight percent”, “salt bath temperature” and “coating time”. Accordingly, the thickness of duplex coating in each specimen was estimated accurately. Finally, the proposed ANN-based model showed a strong potential for predicting the layer thickness of duplex ceramic coating performed by the TRD technique on the substrate of cold work tool steel.","Pouraliakbar, Hesam;Khalaj, Gholamreza;Gomidželović, Lidija;Khalaj, Mohamad-Javad;Nazerfakhari, Mohsen",2015-09-30,Ceramics International,"Duplex surface treatment,Thermo-reactive deposition and diffusion (TRD),Thermodynamics,Kinetics,Modeling",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.03.306,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.03.306
"Electrochemical behavior of (Cr, W, Al, Ti, Si)N multilayer coating on nitrided AISI 316L steel in natural seawater","AISI 316L steel is often used in materials applied toward nuclear power but are subjected to pitting corrosion in a marine environment. In this study, (Cr, W, Al, Ti, Si)N multilayer coatings were deposited using multi-arc ion plating on the surface of non-nitrided and nitrided AISI 316L steel. The microstructure and corrosion resistance of four different systems were investigated, namely, (i) untreated AISI 316L steel, (ii) plasma nitrided (PN), (iii) coated on an untreated matrix (coating) only, and (iv) coated on nitrided (hybrid) specimens. The phase structures, morphologies, and compositions of the different specimens were characterized using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope, Atomic Force Microscope, scanning electron microscope, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The results show that a thin CrWAlTiSiN multilayer coating, approximately 2.3 μm in thickness, is deposited on the surface of an ~12 μm nitrided layer. Potentio-dynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used to evaluate the assessment of the electrochemical behavior in the natural seawater of China's Yellow Sea. The hybrid specimens exhibited excellent corrosion resistance compared to both the nitrided and coated specimens.","Ye, Q.W.;Li, Y.;Zhang, M.Y.;Zhang, S.Z.;Bi, Y.J.;Gao, X.P.;He, Y.Y.",2020-10-01,Ceramics International,"Coating,Plasma nitriding,Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy,Corrosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.323,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.323
Production of N-doped anatase TiO2 on TiN-coated Ti substrates by plasma electrolytic oxidation for visible-light photocatalysts,"N-doped TiO2 exhibiting visible-light photocatalytic activity is useful for many environmental and energy applications. In this work, N-doped anatase TiO2 coatings were facilely produced by plasma electrolytic oxidation using two types of nitrogen doping sources including the TiN seeding layers and the electrolytes consisting of (NaPO3)6 and NaOH mixed with various NH4OH concentrations. The TiN seeding layers were deposited on Ti foils by a unique air-based sputtering technique. Effects of the TiN seeding layers and the NH4OH concentrations added in the electrolytes on the characteristics and the resulting visible-light photocatalytic activity of obtained N-TiO2 coatings were investigated. Enhanced bandgap narrowing and visible-light photocatalytic activity for the coatings were achieved by using the TiN seeding layer and the optimum NH4OH concentration added in the electrolytes. The synergistic effects of both nitrogen doping sources were discussed. The facile controlled growth of N-doped anatase TiO2 coatings with uniform porous surface morphologies has great potentials in visible-light photocatalytic applications.","Lin, Guan-Wei;Huang, Yu-Hsin;Tseng, Wenjea;Lu, Fu-Hsing",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"N-doped TiO2,Plasma electrolytic oxidation,TiN,NH4OH,Visible-light photocatalyst",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.275,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.275
Preparation of Ag@AgCl/g-C3N4/TiO2 porous ceramic films with enhanced photocatalysis performance and self-cleaning effect,"We report a novel method to prepare translucent and stable Ag@AgCl/g-C3N4/TiO2 ceramic films having strong photocatalytic activities and self-cleaning capabilities under light irradiation. Colloidal silica was used as an inorganic binder and P25 TiO2 was added as a hydrophilicity enhancer without which a smooth coating was not achievable. Ag@AgCl of particle size around 30 nm, was synthesized by in-situ oxidation of nano-silver particles in porous g-C3N4/TiO2 films. Optimal conditions for Ag@AgCl/g-C3N4/TiO2 preparation in terms of strongest photocatalysis were established by tests on Rhodamine B degradation under visible and full spectral irradiations. A good adhesion strength of the porous films on glass substrate was achieved. Stability and reusability of the films were assessed by cycling tests. Possible photocatalytic mechanisms are proposed based on the basis of trapping experiments. Systematic characterization of the film suggests that the in-situ oxidation is an effective and practical method to produce nanoscale Ag@AgCl.","Lv, Xiang;Wang, Tianhe;Jiang, Wei",2018-06-01,Ceramics International,"Ag@AgCl/g-C3N4/TiO2 ceramic films,Porosity,Photocatalysis,Self-cleaning",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.145,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.145
Cavitation-corrosion behaviors of HVOF sprayed WC-25WB-10Co-5NiCr and MoB-25NiCr coatings,"Cavitation erosion, corrosion and synergism behaviors of HVOF sprayed WC-25WB-10Co-5NiCr and MoB-25NiCr coatings were investigated in this study. Conventional WC-10Co-4Cr and Cr3C2-25NiCr coatings were also characterized for comparison purposes. The cavitation erosion and cavitation-corrosion experiments were carried out in deionized water and 3.5 wt% NaCl solution respectively. The average mass loss rate was defined to assess the destruction of the coating surface. The cavitation erosion resistance and the cavitation-corrosion resistance were adopted to quantitatively analyze the difference of cavitation erosion and cavitation-corrosion performance of the coatings. The potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were employed to evaluate the corrosion resistance of all the coatings. In addition, the equivalent circuit models were designed to fit the EIS. The cumulative mass loss of all the coatings was measured under the conditions of pure cavitation erosion, pure corrosion and cavitation-corrosion. The total mass loss rate, pure cavitation rate, pure corrosion rate as well as synergistic mass loss rate were calculated to discuss their relative contributions responsible for the material removal. The cavitation-corrosion mechanisms were also discussed by analyzing the eroded surface for all the coatings.","Du, Jin;Zhang, Jianfeng;Xu, Jinyong;Zhang, Chao",2020-09-30,Ceramics International,"Cavitation,Corrosion,Synergism,Coating,Resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.279,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.279
Effect of LaB6 content on the gas evolution and structure of ZrC coating for carbon/carbon composites during ablation,"ZrC coatings with different contents of LaB6 for SiC-coated carbon/carbon composites were fabricated by supersonic atmosphere plasma spraying. The mechanism of gas evolution during oxidation at ultra-high temperatures and the oxide scale structure evolution of the coating after addition of LaB6 with different contents were studied. Results showed that rare earth borate rather than rare earth oxide mainly reduced the melting resistance of the oxide scale. The oxide scale for ZrC coating with 10% LaB6 was unfavorable to the gas escape. After addition of 20% LaB6, the oxide scale was favorable to the gas escape but disadvantageous to the coating applied in the environment containing scouring because of the reduced melting resistance. High content of LaB6 also could cause evident boiling of B2O3, leading to producing big pores in the oxide scale during ablation. Appropriate content of LaB6 for ZrC coating was found to be 15%.","Jia, Yujun;Li, Hejun;Yao, Xiyuan;Zhao, Zhigang;Sun, Jiajia",2017-03-31,Ceramics International,"Carbides,Coatings,Oxidation,Rare earth compound",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.11.197,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.11.197
Preparation and characterization of YSZ abradable sealing coating through mixed solution precursor plasma spraying,"Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) ceramic matrix abradable sealing coatings were prepared by plasma spraying of a blend of YSZ solution precursor with YSZ nano-particles. The microstructure and phase compositions of the prepared abradable sealing coatings were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). In addition, the mechanical, high-temperature oxidation, and tribological properties of the coatings were systematically investigated. The results show that addition of YSZ nano-particles increased porosity and bond strength and decreased the hardness of the coating. The optimum performance value was achieved by addition of 5 g nano-particles into the coating. The coatings maintained excellent thermal stability through a ten-cycle thermal shock test at 1150 °C. The 8YSZ-5 coating had an improved oxidation constant of 5.540 × 10−4 and exhibited remarkable oxidation kinetics at 1150 °C. The friction coefficient of the mixed solution precursor coating was remarkably decreased compared with a traditional ceramic matrix abradable sealing coating. The results indicate that mixed solution precursor plasma spraying increased abradable sealing coating application performance.","Wang, Zhe;Du, Lingzhong;Lan, Hao;Huang, Chuanbing;Zhang, Weigang",2019-06-15,Ceramics International,"Mixed solution precursor plasma spraying,Abradable sealing coating,Bond strength,Hardness,Thermal stability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.058,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.058
Protective properties of Al2O3 + TiO2 coating produced by the electrostatic spray deposition method,"Mechanical resistance of Al2O3 + TiO2 nanocomposite ceramic coating deposited by electrostatic spray deposition method onto X10CrAlSi18 steel to thermal and slurry tests was investigated. The coating was produced from colloidal suspension of TiO2 nanoparticles dispersed in 3wt% solution of Al2(NO3)3, as Al2O3 precursor, in ethanol. TiO2 nanoparticles of two sizes, 15nm and 32nm, were used in the experiments. After deposition, coatings were annealed at various temperatures, 300, 1000 and 1200°C, and next exposed to cyclic thermal and slurry tests. Regardless of annealing temperature and the size of TiO2 nanoparticles, the outer layer of all coatings was porous. The first five thermal cycles caused a rapid increase of aluminum content of the surface layer to 30–37wt%, but further increase in the number of thermal cycles did not affect the aluminum content. The oxidation rate of coating-substrate system was lower during the thermal tests than during annealing. The oxidation rate was also lower for smaller TiO2 particles (15nm) forming the coating than for the larger ones (32nm). The protective properties of Al2O3 + TiO2 coating against intense oxidation of substrate were lost at 1200°C. Slurry tests showed that coatings annealed at 1000°C had the best slurry resistance, but thermal tests had weakened this slurry resistance, mainly due to decreasing adhesion of the coating.","Krella, Alicja K.;Krupa, Andrzej;Gazda, Maria;Sobczyk, Arkadiusz T.;Jaworek, Anatol",2017-10-15,Ceramics International,"Al2O3 + TiO2 coating,Ceramic coating,Surface oxidation,Electrostatic spray deposition,Thermal stress,Slurry tests,Surface fracture",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.070,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.070
Microwave assisted deposition of strontium doped hydroxyapatite coating on AZ31 magnesium alloy with enhanced mineralization ability and corrosion resistance,"Strontium has been suggested to have beneficial effects on bone remolding when incorporated at a suitable dose in apatite. In this work, strontium doped hydroxyapatite coating was prepared on magnesium (Mg) alloy substrates via microwave assisted deposition method for the purpose of improving the corrosion resistance and bioactivity of the substrates. A homogeneous and crack-free strontium doped hydroxyapatite (SrHA) coating with a special dual-layer structure was successfully fabricated on Mg alloy substrates in a short time of 10min under microwave irradiation. Immersion tests in simulated body fluid (SBF) revealed that SrHA coatings could provide protection for Mg alloys in the initial stage and simultaneously induce new apatite precipitation to form a dense layer on the coating surface, suggesting that the SrHA coatings could accelerate the apatite precipitation and thus improve the bioactivity of Mg alloy substrates. The long-term immersion and electrochemical tests revealed that the deposited apatite layer could markedly improve the corrosion resistance of the coated samples over the immersion period of 32 days.","Yu, Nian;Cai, Shu;Wang, Fengwu;Zhang, Feiyang;Ling, Rui;Li, Yue;Jiang, Yangyang;Xu, Guohua",2017-02-01,Ceramics International,"Microwave,Strontium doped hydroxyapatite coating,Magnesium alloy,Mineralization,Corrosion resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.11.050,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.11.050
"The structure and in vitro apatite formation ability of porous titanium covered bioactive microarc oxidized TiO2-based coatings containing Si, Na and Ca","The microarc oxidation (MAO) was used to prepare TiO2 based coating containing Si, Ca and Na elements (SCN) on porous titanium sintered with different sizes of titanium beads. The chemical states of elements and apatite-forming ability of MAO coatings were investigated. The effect of titanium beads diameter on the chemical states of Ca and Si of MAO coatings on the surfaces of porous titanium is not obvious. However, the chemical states of Ti and O changed when the titanium beads diameter increased. The current results reveal that the MAO coatings containing SCN elements have good induction capability for the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of apatite in a simulated body fluid (SBF). The appropriate size of titanium beads could promote the apatite formation on porous titanium with MAO coatings. The reason for this is that the appropriate size of titanium beads can be helpful to introduce more amounts of SCN elements into MAO coatings on the porous titanium.","Zhou, Rui;Wei, Daqing;Cheng, Su;Li, Baoqiang;Wang, Yaming;Jia, Dechang;Zhou, Yu;Guo, Haifeng",2014-01-31,Ceramics International,"D.

Design of multifunctional SiO2–TiO2 composite coating materials for outdoor sandstone conservation,"This research was aimed to develop a novel multifunctional SiO2–TiO2 composite coating for application in the field of outdoor sandstone conservation. The SiO2–TiO2 composite coating derived from the sol–gel reaction of tetraethoxysilan (TEOS) and tetrabutyl orthotitanate (TBOT). Hydroxyl-terminated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS-OH) and poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(phenylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO-PPO-PEO, F127) surfactant were added to the SiO2–TiO2 based materials. The contact angle analysis, scanning electron microscopy measurement, stain resistant test, salt crystallization test and outdoor exposure test were conducted to investigate the effectiveness and durability of this composite coating.

Tensile bonding strength and oxyacetylene ablation testing were used to characterize the bonding strength and ablation resistance of the sprayed ZrB2-SiC coating, respectively.

An innovative model coupling TGO growth and crack propagation for the failure assessment of lamellar structured thermal barrier coatings,"The failure of plasma-sprayed thermal barrier coating (TBC) is often caused by the coating spallation due to crack propagation. In this study, a new model with stacking lamellae is developed based on the cross-section micrograph to explore crack propagation behavior within the ceramic top coat (TC) during isothermal cycling. The dynamic growth process of thermally grown oxide (TGO) is simulated via material properties change step by step. The stress profiles in the lamellar model are first evaluated, and the pore and lamellar interface crack effects on the stress state are further explored. Then, the successive crack growth, linkage, and ultimate coating spallation process is simulated. The results show that the stress intensity in TC enhances with thermal cycling. Large stress concentration always occurs near the pore and lamellar interface crack, which can result in the incipient crack growth. Moreover, the lamellar interface crack also changes the stress distribution within the TC and at the TC/bond coat interface. The multiple crack propagation upon temperature cycling is explored, and the possible coalescence mechanism is proposed. The lamellar crack steadily propagates at the early stage. The crack length sharply increases before the occurrence of coating spallation. The simulated coat spalling path is in line with the experimental result. Therefore, the new lamellar model developed in this work is beneficial to further reveal coating failure mechanism and predict coating lifetime.","Wei, Zhi-Yuan;Cai, Hong-Neng;Meng, Guo-Hui;Tahir, Adnan;Zhang, Wei-Wei",2020-02-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs),Lamellar or layered structure,Thermally grown oxide,Crack propagation,Delamination and failure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.120,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.120
Evaluation of stress distribution and failure mechanism in lanthanum–titanium–aluminum oxides thermal barrier coatings,"LaTi2Al9O19 (LTA) is one of the most promising materials for new thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) to fulfill the demand of advanced gas turbines owing to its high temperature stability and low thermal conductivity. In the present study, a finite element (FE) based numerical study has been carried out to investigate the stress distribution in LTA single layered coating system in comparison with traditional yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) TBC. Stresses in YSZ/LTA double ceramic layer TBC system are also determined and presented for comparative analysis. The thermal cycling effect is simulated by sequent increment in TGO thickness in a series of FE simulations. In-plane stresses (σ xx ), out-of-plane stresses (σ yy) and shear stresses (σ xy ) are determined for all systems, and peak stress values are presented for quantitative comparison. Elastic strain energy stored in TGO of all systems is calculated from FE results for TBC structural integrity assessment. It has been found that maximum in-plane and shear stresses are lower in the double ceramic layer coating system than in the single layer ceramic coating system. However, peak axial tensile and compressive stresses in the double ceramic layer coating are very close or higher than those in the single layer topcoat. Calculation of elastic store energy shows that double ceramic layer TBC system may exhibit better stability as compared to single layer systems. Results are presented to explain the failure mechanism in LTA coatings.","Abbas, Musharaf;Guo, Lei;Guo, Hongbo",2013-07-31,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings (TBC),LaTi2Al9O19 (LTA),Residual stress,Finite element method",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.12.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.12.006
The effect of concentration and source of calcium ions on anticorrosion properties of Ca-doped TiO2 bioactive sol-gel coatings,"Titanium dioxide (TiO2) coating with an enhanced anticorrosion properties and bioactivity was developed by doping it with calcium ions through a sol–gel method. The effect of annealing temperature, anions, as well as calcium ions concentration on microstructural and anticorrosion properties of Ca-doped TiO2 coatings have been investigated. The phase composition and morphology of the coatings were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The corrosion resistance of M30NW biomedical alloy coated with Ca-doped TiO2 coatings was evaluated using electrochemical methods in conditions similar to the normal physiological environments (PBS solution, pH 7.4, temperature of 37°C). The obtained results show that the annealing temperature and the source of calcium ions influence the anticorrosion properties of Ca-doped TiO2 coatings. The best anticorrosion properties were registered for coatings with the highest concentration of Ca ions. At the same time all the examined coatings presented good bioactivity in SBF solution test.","Burnat, Barbara;Robak, Justyna;Leniart, Andrzej;Piwoński, Ireneusz;Batory, Damian",2017-11-30,Ceramics International,"TiO2 coating,Sol-gel processes,Calcium doping,Corrosion,Bioactivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.086,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.086
Characterization and corrosion behavior of graphene oxide-hydroxyapatite composite coating applied by ultrasound-assisted pulse electrodeposition,"Hydroxyapatite (HA) coating reinforced with graphene oxide (GO) had been developed for getting rid of restrictions associated with its brittleness. This study introduced a promising method of ultrasound-assisted pulse electrodeposition to fabricate the GO-HA coating on the anodized heat-treated surface of titanium. The SEM images indicated that the combined effect of employing ultrasonic waves and GO as a second mechanically resistant phase resulted in the formation of a fine and compact microstructure for the HA-based coating. The EDS elemental maps and micro-Raman spectra showed that the ultrasonic power of 60W was more effective to incorporate the GO sheets into the coating. However, aggressive agitation of electrolyte with increasing the power to 100W limited the electrocrystallization of HA crystals in some regions of the surface. The results of nanoindentation test demonstrated the highest nano-hardness (3.08Gpa) and elastic modulus (41.26Gpa) for the GO-HA coating prepared by the ultrasound-assisted method. The EDS and FTIR analyses revealed that both the GO sheets and highly reactive OH · radicals produced during the water sonolysis had a positive influence on the mineralization of HA phase. In addition, the pore size distribution diagrams calculated from the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms indicated a decrease in the pore size of HA crystals for the electro-co-deposited GO-HA sample. Finally, anodizing/heat-treatment process and the incorporation of GO sheets into the coating led to a significant improvement in the corrosion protection of titanium.","Fathyunes, Leila;Khalil-Allafi, Jafar",2017-11-30,Ceramics International,"Graphene oxide,Hydroxyapatite,Electrodeposition,Ultrasonic waves,Mechanical properties,Corrosion resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.113,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.113
Thermal behaviour of multilayer and functionally-graded YSZ/Gd2Zr2O7 coatings,"Zirconates with pyrochlore structure, such as Gd2Zr2O7, are new promising thermal barrier coatings because of their very low thermal conductivity and good chemical resistance against molten salts. However, their coefficient of thermal expansion is low, therefore their thermal fatigue resistance is compromised. As a solution, the combination of yttria-stabilised zirconia (YSZ) and Gd2Zr2O7 can reduce the thermal contraction mismatch between the thermal barrier coating parts. In the present study, two possible designs have been performed to combine YSZ/Gd2Zr2O7. On the one hand, a multilayer coating was obtained where YSZ layer was deposited between a Gd2Zr2O7 layer and a bond coat. On the other hand, a functionally-graded coating was designed where different layers with variable ratios of YSZ/Gd2Zr2O7 were deposited such that the composition gradually changed along the coating thickness. Multilayer and functionally-graded coatings underwent isothermal and thermally-cycled treatments in order to evaluate the oxidation, sintering effects and thermal fatigue resistance of the coatings. The YSZ/Gd2Zr2O7 multilayer coating displayed better thermal behaviour than the Gd2Zr2O7 monolayer coating but quite less thermal fatigue resistance compared to the conventional YSZ coating. However, the functionally-graded coating displays a good thermal fatigue resistance. Hence, it can be concluded that this kind of design is ideal to optimise the behaviour of thermal barrier coatings.","Carpio, P.;Salvador, M.D.;Borrell, A.;Sánchez, E.",2017-04-01,Ceramics International,"E.

Ablation behavior of inorganic particle-filled polybenzoxazine composite coating irradiated by high-intensity continuous laser,"Further utilization of aircraft structural materials is threatened by the fact that high-intensity continuous lasers are widely used in the field of military defense. To protect the aircraft structure from laser damage, ammonium polyphosphate filled polybenzoxazine composite coatings were prepared on the substrate. The anti-laser ablation characteristics of the coatings were investigated. Results showed that the addition of the inorganic filler improved the anti-laser ablation performance of polybenzoxazine. The back-surface temperature of substrates covered with the composite coatings was more 50% lower than that in the case of a pure polybenzoxazine coating after laser ablation. Further, the residue of the composite coating could be vertically divided into three distinct regions, with the dense surface char layer and the porous pyrolysis layer acting as shielding layers for the laser beam and preventing any heat-related transformations from occurring. The addition of the inorganic particles improved the surface reflectivity of the coatings resulting in much more laser energy dissipation. The decreased pyrolysis rate ensured that the pneumatic cooling effect of pyrolysis gas was more lasting and stable, owing to which the composite coatings could act as effective thermal protection layer for longer. These results confirmed that the inorganic filler modified polybenzoxazine coating exhibits excellent anti-laser properties and are suitable for protecting structural materials from laser-related damage.","Xu, Feng;Zhu, Shizhen;Ma, Zhuang;Li, Hezhang;Wang, Jiawei;Wu, Taotao;Wang, Fuchi",2019-08-15,Ceramics International,"Polybenzoxazine composite coating,Laser ablation behavior,Inorganic filler,Heat dissipation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.233,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.233
Carbon fiber reinforced ceramic matrix composites with an oxidation resistant boron nitride interface coating,"Toughening a ceramic in a ceramic matrix composite (CMC) depends on an ability of the composite to tolerate an accumulation of matrix cracks. When the reinforcement phase is carbon fiber, these cracks leave the fiber susceptible to destructive oxidation by ingress of air during high temperature exposure. Generally, a graphitic carbon interface coating is applied to carbon fibers because it provides for a weak bond between fiber and matrix that is required to promote toughening. This investigation seeks to utilize a BN coating instead of a C coating in order to promote oxidation resistance. Like graphitic carbon, BN is soft and easily cleavable. Preliminary observations that C/BN/SiC CMC's using Toray T300 carbon fibers were highly brittle and of low strength lead to a requirement of heat treating the fibers prior to the CVD of BN for toughened composites to be fabricated. It is likely heat treating removed reactive functionalities from the fiber surface to yield a weakly adhered and compliant interface.","Frueh, Samuel J.;Coons, Timothy P.;Reutenauer, Justin W.;Gottlieb, Rebecca;Kmetz, Michael A.;Suib, Steven L.",2018-09-30,Ceramics International,"B.

Silica coating of ultrafine MgO,"Silica coating of ultrafine magnesia powders, which were prepared by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method and had the surface area-equivalent spherical diameters of 160, 550 and 930 Å, was studied by using CVD of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS). A gas mixture of TEOS and air or nitrogen was passed through an MgO powder bed kept at 400 C. The deposition rate of SiO2 was higher by 3 times in air than in N2. The amount of deposit increased linearly with coating time except at the early stage. Uniform coating of noncrystalline silica was observed on MgO particles. Heat treatment of silica-coated magnesia showed the formation of Mg2SiO4 at 900°C. On silica-coated magnesia powders, the acid resistance, dispersion properties in liquid, and sintering behavior were examined.","Toda, Y.;Kato, A.",1989-12-31,Ceramics International, ,10.1016/0272-8842(89)90011-4,https://doi.org/10.1016/0272-8842(89)90011-4
Promotion of the fragmentation and densification for a dense vacuum kinetic-sprayed Y2O3 coating by heat-treatment of feedstock powder,"Achieving a proper strength and properties of vacuum kinetic-sprayed (VKS) coatings has been a matter of issue. The heat-treatment of feedstock powder has been suggested as a solution to prevent porous microstructure of coatings. Unfortunately, there is still no study that clearly explains the effect of powder treatment on the two crucial deposition mechanisms in VKS (fragmentation and consolidation). Through observations and characterization of the coating microstructure and single-particle impact testing, the importance of the sufficient impact energy for dense VKS coatings is demonstrated. The results show that heat-treatment of Y2O3 powder resulted in improved mechanical properties of the coating and a dense coating structure. It is revealed that the larger heat-treated particles caused further size reduction of crystallites and consolidation via promotion of the intense fragmentation and intimate inter-crystallite bonding.","Kwon, Hansol;Kim, Yeonju;Park, Hyungkwon;Jeong, Seonghoon;Lee, Changhee",2020-05-31,Ceramics International,"Vacuum kinetic spraying (VKS),Mechanical property,Single-particle impact test,Transmission electron microscope (TEM),Powder heat treatment",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.149,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.149
"Synthesis and study of Y0.9Ln0.1VO4 nanophosphors and Y0.9Ln0.1VO4@SiO2 luminescent nanocomposites with Ln=Eu, Dy, Er","Y0.9Ln0.1VO4 nanophosphors with Ln=Eu, Dy and Er samples were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis and covered with silica (SiO2) by the Stöber method using different reaction times. The synthesized samples were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). XRD patterns show diffraction maxima compatible with a zircon-type structure where more intense reflexions are observed in the XRD pattern of Y0.9Er0.1VO4 sample. FTIR spectra of Y0.9Ln0.1VO4@SiO2 samples reveal absorption bands which can be attributed to Si-O-Si and O-Si-O stretching bands and Si-O bending vibration. In all cases, TEM micrographs of Y0.9Ln0.1VO4 phosphors show spherical nanoparticles. Nanoparticles agglomerates covered by a silica were found in TEM micrographs of Y0.9Ln0.1VO4@SiO2 samples. The thickness of the silica coating is dependent on the reaction time. PL measurements show variation of the emission intensity related to the different thickness of the silica coating.","Alcaraz, L.;Isasi, J.",2017-04-15,Ceramics International,"Nanocomposites,SiO2,Core-shell,Optical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.01.069,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.01.069
Highly sensitive H2S gas sensors based on CuO-coated ZnSnO3 nanorods synthesized by thermal evaporation,"ZnSnO3 one-dimensional (1D) nanostrutures were synthesized by thermal evaporation. The morphology, crystal structure and sensing properties of the CuO-coated ZnSnO3 nanostructures to H2S gas at 100°C were examined. Transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction revealed both the ZnSnO3 nanorods and CuO nanoparticles to be single crystals. The diameters of the CuO nanoparticles on the nanorods ranged from a few to a few tens of nanometers. The gas sensors fabricated from multiple networked CuO-coated ZnSnO3 nanorods exhibited enhanced electrical responses to H2S gas compared to the uncoated ZnSnO3 nanorod sensors, showing 61.7-, 49.9-, and 31.3-fold improvement at H2S concentrations of 25, 50, and 100ppm, respectively. The response time of the nanorod sensor to H2S gas was reduced by the CuO coating but the recovery time was similar. The mechanism for the enhanced H2S gas sensing properties of ZnSnO3 nanorods by the CuO coating is discussed.","Jin, Changhyun;Kim, Hyunsu;An, Soyeon;Lee, Chongmu",2012-09-30,Ceramics International,"ZnSnO3,Nanorods,Thermal evaporation,CuO,H2S",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.04.050,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.04.050
Liquid gadolinium corrosion study of TaC coating on tantalum,Spectroscopic information of gadolinium isotopes is necessary to exploit the full potential of various isotopes in nuclear and medical applications. Container materials to handle liquid gadolinium during spectroscopic studies is an important aspect. Tantalum carbide (TaC) has excellent stability and also exhibits superior resistance to attack by various reactive actinide metals at high temperature for long durations. Tantalum crucibles with TaC coating were prepared and tested for compatibility against liquid gadolinium at 1673 K upto 14 h in vacuum. Optical microscopy and SEM/EDS investigations were done to evaluate the micro structural features of the coating and the liquid gadolinium attack. Experimental results show that TaC coating exhibits excellent corrosion resistance against liquid gadolinium at 1673 K.,"Alangi, Nagaraj;Mukherjee, Jaya",2018-11-30,Ceramics International,"Gadolinium,Corrosion,Tantalum carbide",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.211,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.211
Preparation of silver nanowire/AZO composite film as a transparent conductive material,"In this paper, flexible, robustly adhesive, surface smooth and oxide-resistive AgNWs/AZO composite transparent conductive films (TCFs) were prepared by spin-coating solvothermal derived AgNWs followed by magnetron sputtering AZO protective layer, after which, annealing treatment at 200℃ for 20min was adopted to further increase the performance of the composite film. The samples were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scan electron microscopy, scanning probe microscope, UV–Vis spectrophotometer and four point probe. The best result of AgNWs/AZO composite films was the one with a transmittance of 85% at 550nm accompanied with a low sheet resistance of 19Ω/□ by controlling the spin-coating times fixed at three. The figure of merit for the composite TCFs was 10.4, which was larger than the value of 8.8 for commercial ITO film. These amazing results would render the AgNWs /AZO composite TCFs an ideal candidate to replace conventional ITO for its potential application in flexible devices including OPV and OLED.","Tang, Quntao;Shen, Honglie;Yao, Hanyu;Jiang, Ye;Zheng, Chaofan;Gao, Kai",2017-01-31,Ceramics International,"Silver nanowire,Transparent conductive film,AZO,Magnetron sputtering",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.048,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.048
Effects of solution pH value and mineralizer on formation and color property of holmium molybdate pigment via co-precipitation and sintering,"A novel functional ceramic or glass pigment of monoclinic holmium molybdate (Ho2MoO6) with ‘allochroic effect’ was synthesized via co-precipitation and subsequent low-temperature sintering with different mineralizers (i.e., lithium chloride, sodium fluoride and boric acid). Effects of solution pH value and mineralizer type/content on Ho2MoO6 formation at different sintering temperatures and time were investigated. The results reveal that the solution pH value in co-precipitation reaction has an influence on the element ratio of Mo and Ho in the precursor and the pigment purity. The sintering temperature of forming sole Ho2MoO6 phase is decreased by 200 °C and the sintering duration is reduced in the presence of 5 wt % lithium chloride due to the decreased crystallization activation energy. Meanwhile, Ho2MoO6 pigment as powder or coating on ceramic tile and glass exhibits various colors (i.e., pale yellow, salmon, mustard and coral) under different illuminants (i.e., incandescent lamp A, solar-light D65, cool white fluorescent lamp F2 and three-band fluorescent lamp F11).","Li, Xiangyu;Wang, Yanmin;Pan, Zhidong",2020-10-21,Ceramics International,"Holmium molybdate,Mineralizer,Co-precipitation,Activation energy,Allochroic effect",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.154,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.154
Influence of infiltration temperature on the microstructure and oxidation behavior of SiC–ZrC ceramic coating on C/C composites prepared by reactive melt infiltration,"SiC–ZrC ceramic coating on C/C composites was prepared by reactive melt infiltration (RMI) using a powder mixture composed of Zr, Si and C as the infiltrator. The phase composition and microstructure of the ceramic coating were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The oxidation resistance of the as-prepared composites was tested at 1550°C in static air. The results indicate that the infiltration temperature has remarkable effects on the phase composition and microstructure of the ceramic coating, as well as on the oxidation resistance of the composites. The SiC–ZrC coated C/C composites prepared at 2000°C exhibit an excellent oxidation resistance. They gain weight about 5.9wt% after oxidation at 1550°C in static air for 5h, whereas the SiC–ZrC coated C/C composites prepared at 1800°C lose weight about 3.2wt%. As a comparison, SiC coated C/C composites prepared at 2000°C by RMI show an inferior oxidation resistance. After 5h oxidation, SiC coated C/C composites are severely damaged and their weight loss reaches up to 44.3wt%. The outstanding oxidation resistance of the SiC–ZrC coated C/C composites prepared at 2000°C can be attributed to the rapid formation of a continuous glass-like layer composed of ZrO2, ZrSiO4 and SiO2, which covers the surface of the composites and retards the oxygen diffusion and the attack on the underlying C/C substrate. For SiC coated C/C composites, the large SiC particles formed on the surface of the composites are difficult to oxidize rapidly and so a continuous and dense SiO2 layer cannot be formed in time to significantly hinder fast oxygen diffusion leading to the consequent severe oxidation of the C/C substrate.","Dong, Z.J.;Liu, S.X.;Li, X.K.;Westwood, A.;Yuan, G.M.;Cui, Z.W.;Cong, Y.",2015-01-31,Ceramics International,"Reactive melt infiltration,Weight loss,Glass-like layer,Oxidation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.08.138,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.08.138
Thermochemical compatibility between La2(Ce1-xZrx)2O7 and 4 mol% Y2O3 stabilized zirconia after high temperature heat treatment,"La2Ce2O7 (LC) has attracted extensive attention as promising material for thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) in next generation gas turbines due to its outstanding thermophysical properties. To eliminate the reaction between LC and thermal grown oxides (TGO), yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is usually employed as the interlayer to form LC/YSZ double-layered structures. However, recent studies have revealed that chemical stability of LC and YSZ system deteriorates at high temperatures, which may hinder the application of LC as TBCs. To address this problem, the chemical compatibility between La2(Ce1-xZrx)2O7 (LCZ) and YSZ at high temperatures was investigated in this work via experiments and atomistic simulations. Results reveal that chemical compatibility increased with the increase in Zr content of LCZ. Corresponding molecular dynamic simulations further verify that the increase in Zr content of LCZ system would reduce Gibbs free energy of LCZ-YSZ composite system. Moreover, common phenomena in LC-YSZ system, such as abnormal grain coarsening and intensive pore diffusion, were effectively suppressed in LCZ-YSZ composite, due to enhanced high temperature chemical compatibility. Results also indicate that the addition of buffer layer, i.e., LCZ-YSZ composite, can effectively improve chemical stability of TBCs based on double layered LC/YSZ.","Yi, Hao;Liu, Xiangyang;Che, Junwei;Liang, Gongying",2020-03-31,Ceramics International,"Chemical compatibility,LCZ,YSZ,Atomistic simulation,High temperature",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.130,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.130
Microstructures and deposition mechanisms of quasi-columnar structured yttria-stabilized zirconia coatings by plasma spray physical vapor deposition,"Quasi-columnar yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) ceramic coatings were prepared by plasma spray physical vapor deposition (PS-PVD). In order to study the formation of quasi-columnar microstructure, coating morphologies and phases were investigated for each set of deposition times and standoff distances. Co-deposited by solid particles, liquid droplets, and vapor phases, the quasi-columnar coating was featured with “wedge” structure where vapors nucleated on micron-sized particles and grew to columns. Compared to the quasi-columnar coating deposited at 1000mm, an extended spray distance of 1900mm had lower growth rates, and resulted in the coating with larger columns and more solidified YSZ particles. A three-dimensional deposition model for quasi-columnar coatings was established. Moreover, the quasi-columnar YSZ TBCs exhibited low thermal conductivity of around 1.1W/mK at 1100°C and had a lifetime of more than 1000 cycles during thermal cycling test.","Zhang, Baopeng;Wei, Liangliang;Guo, Hongbo;Xu, Huibin",2017-10-15,Ceramics International,"Quasi-columnar structure,Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs),Plasma spray physical vapor deposition (PS-PVD),Yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ)",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.190,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.190
The preparation of core–shell Al2O3/Ni composite powders by electroless plating,"Core–shell nanostructured Ni-coated Al2O3 composite powders were synthesised by using the electroless plating method. The influence of the chemical components and powder concentration in the Ni coating was investigated by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction techniques. The results show that the concentration of the plating components plays an important role in the formation of core–shell Al2O3/Ni composite powders. The nickel content in the composite powders could be effectively controlled by adjusting the nickel chloride content and the concentration of NaH2PO2·H2O in the plating solution. The nanostructure of the crystalline Ni coatings was observed to be very attractive for achieving good bonding between ceramic particles and matrices for composite production.","Uysal, Mehmet;Karslioğlu, Ramazan;Alp, Ahmet;Akbulut, Hatem",2013-07-31,Ceramics International,"Electroless Ni coating,Alkaline solution,Core–shell structure,Al2O3 powder",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.12.060,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.12.060
A mechanical and modelling study of magnetron sputtered cerium-titanium oxide film coatings on Si (100),"Ce/Ti mixed metal oxide thin films have well known optoelectrical properties amongst several other physio-chemical properties. Changes in the structural and mechanical properties of magnetron sputtered Ce/Ti oxide thin films on Si (100) wafers with different Ce:Ti ratios are investigated experimentally and by modelling. X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirm the primary phases as trigonal Ce2O3 and rutile form of TiO2 with SiO2 present in all prepared materials. FESEM imaging delivers information based on the variation of grain size, the mixed Ce/Ti oxides providing much smaller grain sizes in the thin film/substrate composite. Nanoindentation analysis concludes that the pure cerium oxide film has the highest hardness value (20.1 GPa), while the addition of excess titanium oxide decreases the hardness of the film coatings. High temperature in-situ XRD (up to 1000 °C) results indicate high thermal phase stability for all materials studied. The film with Ce:Ti = 68%:32% has a new additional minor oxide phase above 800 °C. Contact angle experiments suggest that the chemical composition of the surface is insignificant affecting the water contact angle. Results show a narrow band of 87.7–95.7° contact angle. The finite element modelling (FEM) modelling of Ce/Ti thin film coatings based on Si(100); Si(110); silica and steel substrates shows a variation in stress concentration.","Patel, Shyam Bharatkumar;Radevski, Nik;Mondinos, Nicholas;Zhao, Xiaoli;Jack, Kevin;Veder, Jean-Pierre;Zhou, Zhi-feng;Jiang, Zhong-Tao",2019-04-15,Ceramics International,"in-situ X-ray diffraction,Cerium titanium oxides,Mechanical properties,Nanoindentation,Finite element modelling",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.183,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.183
Morphology and structure of YSZ powders: Comparison between xerogel and aerogel,"Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) fine powders were prepared via sol–gel route in order to shape thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) from these powders. The main objective is to develop new undirectional coatings to allow best thermo-mechanical accommodations compared to conventional processes. To reach this aim, powders have to be able first to be highly dispersed into a sol (non-agglomeration, high specific surface area, etc.) and second to crystallize in the required metastable phase t′. Two routes have been used to dry gels: the conventional way which consists of simple evaporation of the solvent is compared to drying in supercritical conditions. Both YSZ powders after calcination at 950°C of xerogel (Ex-xero-YSZ powder) and aerogel (Ex-aero-YSZ powder) crystallize in the tetragonal form. N2 adsorption/desorption analysis of the Ex-xero-YSZ powder indicates an S w of 2.8m2/g. For the Ex-aero-YSZ powder, the S w (26m2/g) is much higher than of Ex-xero-YSZ, leading to a better sintering capability. This high S w is correlated to the small crystallite size (26nm) and the alveolar morphology of Ex-aero-YSZ powders compared to Ex-xero-powder (49nm). By reducing particles size and increasing the S w of the powders, supercritical drying appears as a promising way to prepare stable slurries or loaded sols from fine YSZ particles for TBC applications. Indeed, after preparing nanometric powders, they are dispersed into a sol before shaping on superalloys substrates. After thermal treatment at 950°C for 2h which corresponds to the working temperature of TBC, the final aim will be to prepare ceramic YSZ coatings.","Fenech, Justine;Viazzi, Céline;Bonino, Jean-Pierre;Ansart, Florence;Barnabé, Antoine",2009-12-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Influence of ionic substitution in improving the biological property of carbon nanotubes reinforced hydroxyapatite composite coating on titanium for orthopedic applications,"The present work is aimed for the development of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) reinforced single mineral (Sr, Mg, Zn) as well as multi minerals (Sr+Mg+Zn) substituted hydroxyapatite composite (M-HAP) coatings on titanium (Ti). The effect of different mineral ions substitution and CNTs reinforcement in HAP composite coating is discussed in detail. Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were used to characterize the structural and morphological behavior of the composite coatings. The corrosion resistance of the composite coatings in simulated body fluid (SBF) solution was evaluated by the potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) studies. In addition, the biocompatibility of the composite coatings was evaluated by in vitro culture of human osteoblast MG63 cells on the composite coated Ti. All these results essentially suggest that CNTs/M-HAP composite coated Ti can be a potential candidate for orthopedic applications.","Gopi, D.;Shinyjoy, E.;Kavitha, L.",2015-05-31,Ceramics International,"B: Composites,B: Spectroscopy,D: Carbon,E: Biomedical applications",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.12.114,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.12.114
Modeling and simulation of thermal fatigue crack in EB-PVD TBCs under non-uniform temperature,"Demand for enhanced jet engine efficiencies has led to a significant increase in the combustion temperature. Thus protecting components against the combustion products is necessary and is possible by using thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). In this research, thermal fatigue and creep interaction are studied via analytical and numerical finite element methods. Thermal stress and crack propagation analyses in the ceramic top coat are carried out based on plane stress condition and under inhomogeneous temperature distribution across the layers. The crack is assumed as a penny-shaped crack in both vertical and inclined growth directions. The study proposed that the creep-plasticity results in thermal stress alleviation and the tensile stress transforms into a compressive stress of − 200MPa in forwarding cycles that will induce crack closure. In addition, the results confirmed that vertical cracks grow much faster than oblique ones due to single mode crack propagation and about 0.14MPa√m greater values in stress intensity factor. The modeling and simulation results match together, and the obtained crack behavior is in compliance with other researcher's output.","Ghaseminezhad Koushali, Ali;Sameezadeh, Mahmood;Vaseghi, Majid;Safarpour, Pedram",2017-11-30,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,Thermal fatigue,Creep,Crack,Stress intensity factor",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.006
Silica coated ferrite nanoparticles: Influence of citrate functionalization procedure on final particle morphology,"In this paper, magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4 and NiFe2O4) were coated with a biocompatible silica shell via hydrolysis and condensation of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) by the Stöber process. Magnetic nanoparticles, prepared by chemical co-precipitation from iron and nickel salts, were functionalized with citric acid, in order to provide their deagglomeration and to enable their coating with silica. The parameters of the functionalization procedure were varied (concentration–pH and type of treatment), in order to examine if and how this particular step of preparation affects the final morphology of the core-shell particles. Transmission electron microscopy, zeta potential and particle size measurements revealed that the morphology and the size of obtained core shell particles depend significantly on the core particle size, and thus on the parameters of the functionalization step.","Mojić, Bojana;Giannakopoulos, Konstantinos P.;Cvejić, Željka;Srdić, Vladimir V.",2012-12-31,Ceramics International,"A.

A comparative study of tensile strength of Cf/SiC composites having single layer and multilayer interphases,"Tensile behaviour of stitched 2D carbon fiber reinforced silicon carbide (Cf/SiC) composites having variable interphases was studied in detail. Two types of interphases (single layer of pyrocarbon interphase and multilayers of pyrocarbon/silicon carbide) were deposited initially on the carbon fiber preforms followed by silicon carbide matrix infiltration. Multilayer interphase was deposited for two different durations. Cf/SiC composites were prepared by isothermal chemical vapour infiltration (ICVI) technique. The as-cut and silicon carbide seal coated samples were subjected to tensile tests in air at room temperature and at 1200 °C. The effect of seal coating and type of interphase on the tensile properties was studied. It was observed that the composites (in uncoated and seal coated condition) with multilayer interphase showed higher values of tensile strength at both the test temperatures as compared to single layer interphase. Also, the composites fabricated with multilayer interphase deposition for longer duration showed highest values of tensile strength at both the test temperatures.

Hot-corrosion behavior of the LC/YSZ TBC exposed to Na2SO4+V2O5 or V2O5 salt at 900°C was investigated. After hot corrosion in Na2SO4+V2O5 salt for 4h, a porous layer mainly composed of (La0.75Ce0.25)VO4 and CeO2 was formed on the LC layer. In V2O5 salt, the molten salt directly reacted with La2Ce2O7 solid solution, leading to the formation of (Ce0.5La0.5)VO4.

Underwater oil contact measurements are performed using a series of oils and it turns out the as-prepared material bear excellent oil repellency towards various oil droplets. Separation performance of the membrane for oily wastewater treatment was investigated.

Sol-gel alumina coating of wire mesh packing,"Wire mesh packings have seen increasing applications to multiphase processes in recent years. Despite the high surface area, open structure and thermal and chemical resistance, wire mesh packings have a complex geometry which hinders some chemical applications, including changes of surface properties through application of a uniformly adhesive coating. In this work, the sol-gel deposition method of alumina coating ceramics was investigated for the first time on stainless steel wire mesh by using Dixon rings as example. The kinetics of deposition during the hydrolysis and polycondensation was followed for a range of initial composition of the coating such as the ratios of Al2O3 to water, acid content, polyethyleneimine binder content and the number of deposition cycles. Well-adhered alumina with a thickness up to 20 μm was successfully deposited. The molar ratios of acid to alumina and alumina to water of 0.25 and 0.01, respectively, 48 h of the aging time, 96 h of the mixing time and 2.1 g/L of polyethyleneimine binder formed a free of cracks coating of controlled thickness alumina on the Dixon rings.","Abdelraouf, Mohamed;Hegarty, Josef;Rennie, Allan;Elizalde, Rémi;Burns, Neil;Geekie, Louise;Najdanovic-Visak, Vesna;Aiouache, Farid",2020-09-30,Ceramics International,"Column packing,Alumina ceramics coating,Wire mesh coating,Dixon ring,Sol-gel,Stainless steel coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.043,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.043
Design and optimization of oxidation resistant coating for C/C aircraft brake materials,"A SiCN/borosilicate glass anti-oxidation coating with double-layer structure was designed for C/C aircraft brake materials. The SiCN layer was introduced as transition layer to improve the wettability between borosilicate glass and C/C composites, and the microstructure results indicated that the coating with SiCN inner layer was dense and uniform. The oxidation resistance evaluation of the coated samples was conducted at 800°C in air for 10h. The weight loss of SiCN/borosilicate glass coated samples valued ~ 5.66% indicated that the oxidation resistant property of the simple SiCN/borosilicate glass coating was not good, which was mainly due to the relative large viscosity of borosilicate glass at 800°C. B4C was introduced to add into the outer glass coating to improve the self-healing ability of the coating. After oxidized at 800°C in air for 10h, the weight loss of the SiCN/borosilicate glass-B4C coated samples was ~ 2.48%. B4C could consume the oxygen diffused into the coating and the reacted product B2O3 with a better fluidity at 800°C could effectively heal cracks and pores in the coating to improve the oxidation resistance property. The reaction of B4C oxidized to B2O3 was accompanied with ~ 1.5 times volume expansion, which was also beneficial for the healing of defects.","Fan, Shangwu;Ma, Xu;Li, Zuo;Hu, Jing;Xie, Zan;Deng, Juanli;Zhang, Litong;Cheng, Laifei",2018-01-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Oxidation resistance and thermal shock properties of self-healing SiCN/borosilicate glass-B4C-Al2O3 coatings for C/C aircraft brake materials,"SiCN/borosilicate glass-B4C-Al2O3 coating was deposited on carbon fiber-reinforced carbon matrix (C/C) brake materials to protect them from oxidation. Microstructural analysis revealed that the coating was dense and uniform. Fabricated coating showed excellent oxidation resistance and significantly low weight losses after oxidation in dry air for 10 h than SiCN/borosilicate glass-B4C coated samples (ca. 0.12%, 0.51%, and 0.29% at 700, 800, and 900 °C, respectively). B4C is believed to react with the oxygen diffused into the coating to produce B2O3, which could heal cracks of the coating and improve its self-sealing ability and oxidation resistance. The Al2O3 present in the outer glass layer is believed to inhibit volatilization of B2O3, thereby reducing weight losses in air. Fabricated coating also possessed excellent oxidation resistance under fresh and sea water conditions, with cracks and pores generated during oxidization process being effectively healed. Prepared coating materials showed excellent thermal shock resistances after 50 thermal shock cycles, with weight losses being as low as 0.23%.","Fan, Shangwu;Ma, Xu;Ji, Biao;Li, Zuo;Xie, Zan;Deng, Juanli;Zhang, Litong;Cheng, Laifei",2019-01-31,Ceramics International,"Self-healing coating,Oxidation resistance,Thermal shock,C/C brake",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.207,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.207
Enhanced properties of Al-modified EB-PVD 7YSZ thermal barrier coatings,"7wt% yttria-stabilized zirconia (7YSZ) thermal barrier coating (TBC) prepared by electron beam-physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD) has been used in gas turbine engines for many years, where the TBC must successfully withstands the damage caused by a variety of environmental and mechanical aspects. The primary failure modes for TBC are oxidation of bond coating, particle erosion and CMAS (calcium-magnesium-alumina-silicates) corrosion. The lifetime of TBC associated with above three failure factors will be reduced significantly. In order to prolong the operation time, an alternative approach depositing Al film on 7YSZ TBC surface by magnetron sputtering is proposed. An α-Al2O3 overlay was in-situ synthesized on each 7YSZ column through reaction of Al and ZrO2 during vacuum heat treatment. And the results indicate that the Al-modified EB-PVD 7YSZ TBC shows better oxidation resistance, as well as lower particulate erosion and CMAS corrosion.","Zhang, X.F.;Zhou, K.S.;Liu, M.;Deng, C.M.;Deng, C.G.;Song, J.B.;Tong, X.",2016-09-30,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,EB-PVD,Al modification,In-situ synthesis",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.210,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.210
Mechanism of high temperature oxidation resistance improvement of double-layer thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) by La,"In order to reveal the mechanism of high temperature oxidation resistance improvement of double-layer thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) by La, two kinds of TBCs were prepared by atmospheric plasma spraying, whose ceramic coating were single-layer ZrO2 Y2O3 (YSZ) and double-layer La2Zr2O7(LZ)/YSZ, respectively. Subsequently, the two TBCs were oxidized at 1100 °C. The experimental results show that the presence of LZ prevented the rapid oxidation of bonding coating and the rapid growth of thermal growth oxide (TGO), which led to the decrease in frequency of TGO bulges and the number of spinel oxides in TGO. La3+ can control the phase transformation of TGO, i.e. reduce the transition rate from metastable phase θ-Al2O3 to stable phase α-Al2O3, thereby reduce the residual stress. La3+ made the diffusion of cations in bonding coating to be obstructed, thus the formation of spinel phase was inhibited further, which was beneficial to the adhesion between TGO and coating. Therefore, double-layer LZ/YSZ TBCs exhibited superior high temperature oxidation resistance to single-layer YSZ due to the presence of LZ ceramic coating.","Dong, Tian-Shun;Wang, Ran;Di, Yue-Lan;Wang, Hai-Dou;Li, Guo-Lu;Fu, Bin-Guo",2019-05-31,Ceramics International,"Double-layer TBCs,Rare earth lanthanum,TGO,High temperature oxidation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.251,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.251
New high temperature amorphous protective coatings for Mg2Si thermoelectric material,"Magnesium silicide is one of the most promising, inexpensive, environment friendly and low density (1.99 g cm−3) thermoelectric material. These attributes distinguish it from other well-known thermoelectric materials and therefore it is currently intensively studied. Since thermoelectric materials are used in elevated temperatures, they are prone to oxygen corrosion which results in deterioration of their properties and therefore require anticorrosion protection. The aim of the work was to develop anticorrosive coating for magnesium silicide using silane-based, amorphous coatings. High purity Mg2Si samples were prepared by self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) and hot-pressing method supported by induction heater. The structural and phase compositions of the obtained samples were examined by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) method and chemical composition analysis by scanning electron microscopy SEM, combined with EDS method. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy FT-IR, Raman spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and temperature-programmed oxidation (TPOx) methods were used in order to determine chemical stability of prepared samples. In final step, magnesium silicide samples were covered with selected amorphous coatings by dip-coating method and then annealed in Ar gas atmospheres in various temperatures between 400–550 °C. The obtained coatings were characterized using SEM-EDS and reflectance spectroscopy method.","Nieroda, Pawel;Mars, Krzysztof;Nieroda, Jolanta;Leszczyński, Juliusz;Król, Magdalena;Drożdż, Ewa;Jeleń, Piotr;Sitarz, Maciej;Koleżyński, Andrzej",2019-06-01,Ceramics International,"Magnesium silicide,Thermoelectric materials,SiOC coatings,Protective coatings",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.075,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.075
VO2(M)@CeO2 core-shell nanospheres for thermochromic smart windows and photocatalytic applications,"Vanadium dioxide (VO2(M)) is a first order reversible thermochromic material which changes its phase at particular temperature and thus can be used as a thermochromic smart material for window coating. Similarly, the cerium dioxide (CeO2) is a well-known photo catalyst which can be applied on vanadium dioxide for self-cleaning. This paper reports a successful direct synthesis and detailed characterizations of core-shell VO2(M)@CeO2 spherical nanoparticles. In the core-shell nanoparticles, the vanadium dioxide core exhibits a solar light modulation property while cerium dioxide shell shows dye degradation through a facile photocatalytic process. Addition of ceria facilitates the VO2 (B) to VO2 (M) transformation and also improves its optical properties. With reduced transition temperature, the thermal stability was enhanced due to core –shell structure. To the extent of our knowledge, the synthesis of core-shell VO2@CeO2 nanoparticles is reported for the first time. The synthesized nanoparticles exhibited improved thermochromic and photocatalytic properties.","Saini, Meenu;Dehiya, Brijnandan S.;Umar, Ahmad",2020-01-31,Ceramics International,"VO2(M)@CeO2 core-shell,Thermochromic material,Photocatalytic",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.062,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.062
Effect of CeO2 and graphite powder on the electrochemical performance of Ti/PbO2 anode for zinc electrowinning,"In the zinc hydrometallurgy process, the key to reduce the voltage of the corrosion is to reduce the oxygen evolution potential of the anode. In this experiment, the effects of doped CeO2 and graphite powder (GP) on the electrochemical properties of Ti/PbO2 were investigated. Ti/PbO2, Ti/PbO2-CeO2, Ti/PbO2-GP and Ti/PbO2-CeO2-GP anode were prepared by direct current (DC) plating. The surface morphology and composition of these different Ti/PbO2 electrodes before and after polarisation were analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The corrosion mechanism was analysed by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The cell voltage, current efficiency, service life and failure mechanism of Ti/PbO2 anodes were observed and analysed by simulating electrowinning experiments. The results show that Ti/PbO2-CeO2-GP anodes is denser than other electrodes. Ti/PbO2-CeO2 (12 g/L)-GP (8 g/L) with the lowest anode potential is 1.5390 V. The potential of the lowest oxygen evolution peak of the Ti/PbO2-CeO2 (12 g/L)-GP (8 g/L) electrode is 0.824 V. The Ti/PbO2-CeO2-GP anode had a minimum cell voltage of 2.85 V and a current efficiency of 95.8%. The Ti/PbO2-CeO2-GP has a minimum corrosion rate of − 0.0320 g·A−1·h−1 and a longest anode lifetime of up to 127 h. The best electrode for the surface coating is Ti/PbO2-CeO2 (12 g/L)-GP (8 g/L).","Zhang, Cheng;Liu, Jianhua;Chen, Buming",2018-11-30,Ceramics International,"Zinc electrowinning,Ti/PbO2 anode,Electrochemical,CeO2,Graphite powder",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.227,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.227
Electrical properties of tin-doped indium oxide thin films prepared by a dip coating,"Indium-tin-oxide (ITO) transparent conducting films were prepared by a dip coating process and heated in air at 1000°C, which is much higher than the temperature applied in a normal dip coating process, where heating occurs at approximately 500°C. This was done in order to enhance grain growth. Heat-resistant substrates silicon, sapphire and YSZ were used. Grain growth (average size=52nm), high carrier electron mobility (average value=46m2 V−1 s−1) and low resistivity (average value=3.7×10−4 Ωcm) were all achieved successfully after post-deposition annealing at 600°C in a N2-0.1%H2 atmosphere, for all of the films except the one deposited on a silicon substrate, whose respective values were 28nm, 19m2 V−1 s−1 and 1.0×10−3 Ωcm.","Seki, Y.;Sawada, Y.;Wang, M.H.;Lei, H.;Hoshi, Y.;Uchida, T.",2012-01-31,Ceramics International,"A.

"Preparation of Ni–Mo–C/Ti(C,N) coated powders and its influence on the microstructure and mechanical properties of Ti(C,N)-based cermets","Ni–Mo–C/Ti(C,N) coated powders, namely Ni–Mo alloy and Mo2C coated Ti(C,N) composite powders, were synthesized by using a heterogeneous precipitation and thermal reduction method, then pressed and vacuum sintered to fabricate cermets. The chemical composition, microstructure and phases of the composite powders and the microstructure and properties of sintered cermets were experimentally investigated. The results show that a fine and uniform microstructure of (Ti,Mo)(C,N)-Ni cermets without the conventional core-rim structure is obtained. The phases formed during the preparation of the coated powders as well as the cermets were analyzed by means of a X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. The XRD result confirms the formation of the Ni3Ti phase in the cermets. Due to the formation of the non-magnetic Ni3Ti and the dissolution of Mo in Ni binder phase, the magnetic properties are strongly retarded. The fracture of the cermets is mainly characterized by inter-granular and dimple fractures. Better mechanical properties can be obtained in comparison with conventionally fabricated ones.","Zhou, Shuzhu;Luo, Cheng;Wu, Xiaobo;Zhu, Lei;Tan, Jinhao",2015-09-30,Ceramics International,"Ti(C,N) based cermets,Heterogeneous precipitation,Coating,Core-rim structure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.03.062,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.03.062
Microstructures and properties of in-situ TiC particles reinforced Ni-based composite coatings prepared by plasma spray welding,"In this investigation, the in-situ TiC particles reinforced Ni-based composite coatings were produced by plasma spray welding with mixed powders (NiCrBSi+Ti+NiCr–Cr3C2). Their microstructures and properties were studied. The experimental results showed that the composite coatings consisted mainly of γ-Ni, Cr23C6, Cr7C3, Ni3Si, Cr5B3, CrB, FeNi3 and TiC phases. TiC particles were in-situ synthesized during plasma spray welding. The content of TiC particles and chromium carbides in the coatings increased with the mass fractions of Ti and NiCr–Cr3C2 powders increasing in the mixed powders, which resulted in enhancing the composite coatings hardness. The composite coating prepared with the mixed powder (70wt%NiCrBSi+30wt% (Ti+NiCr–Cr3C2)) showed a higher hardness 1142HV0.5. The wear resistance of the composite coatings were greatly improved due to the presence of in-situ TiC particles in comparison with the substrate. When the mixed powder (75wt%NiCrBSi+25wt% (Ti+NiCr–Cr3C2)) was used, the composite coating had better wear resistance, and the coating wear volume loss after wear tests was 6mm3, which was only 5% of that for the low carbon steel substrate (125mm3).","Huang, Shiming;Sun, Daqian;Wang, Wenquan;Xu, Hongyong",2015-11-30,Ceramics International,"B.

The optimal molar ratio (LiTiO2: NCA) was found to be 1.0 mol%, and the thickness of LiTiO2 film coated on the surface of NCA of 18 nm was observed through HRTEM images. Compared with pristine NCA, 1.0 mol% LiTiO2-coated NCA demonstrated better electrochemical performance with larger capacity of 20 mAh g−1 under 1 C after 100 cycles.

Effects of HfC nanowires on the growth behavior, microstructure and ablation resistance of the HfC coating were researched. Due to the incorporation of HfC nanowires, the deposition rate of the HfC coating was improved, the HfC coating was composed of particle-stacked crystals. After incorporating HfC nanowires, the bonding strength and fracture toughness of the HfC coating increased. HfC nanowires could restrain the crack propagation of HfC coating during ablation, contributing to improving the ablation resistance of HfC coating.

Electrical insulation of ceramic thin film on metallic aero-engine blade for high temperature sensor applications,"Fabricating sensor devices directly on metallic component requires the use of an electrical insulating ceramic layer between the sensor and the metal. However, most ceramics lose their electrical insulation with the increasing temperature. In this paper, electrical insulation properties of ceramic thin film were extensively analyzed in high temperature environment up to 1300°C and a new ceramic coating with good high temperature insulation was developed. Results indicate that the ordinary YSZ ceramic film cannot maintain enough resistivity under high temperature above 600°C. A new methodology is therefore proposed to compensate the possible errors of the sensors brought by the reduced resistivity in the ceramic. Meanwhile an improved ceramic coating recipe was developed to improve the electrical insulation which can meet the high temperature insulation requirement up to 1300°C. Extensive numeric simulations considering electrical and thermal multi-physics interaction were conducted to analyze and estimate electrical performance under high temperature caused by the reduced resistivity of ceramic thin film onto which the thermal sensor is fabricated.

Investigation of calcium phosphate formation from calcium propionate and triethyl phosphate,"Synthetic calcium phosphates are used in for example bone cements and implant coatings to increase biocompatibility. The common method to produce tricalcium phosphate (TCP) uses high temperatures, which creates large crystals with low specific surface areas. In order to investigate new methods to produce TCP at lower temperatures, the reaction between calcium propionate and triethyl phosphate conducted at 220°C was studied. The method had a near 100% conversion rate, the main synthesis products were calcium phosphate and ethyl propionate. The formed calcium phosphate polymorph could be controlled depending on the water content of the precursor mixture. Anhydrous conditions created amorphous calcium phosphate. As the concentration of water increased, β-TCP was formed, followed by calcium deficient hydroxyapatite and monetite. The particle size increased with the water content, from 20 to 40nm for amorphous calcium phosphate to tenths of micrometers for monetite. The specific surface areas varied between 209m2/g for the amorphous product to 3.6m2/g for the monetite product.","Kjellin, Per;Rajasekharan, Anand Kumar;Currie, Fredrik;Handa, Paul",2016-09-30,Ceramics International,"TCP,Calcium phosphates,Nanocrystals,Bone cements",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.013
Microstructural evaluation and thermal oxidation behaviors of YSZ/NiCoCrAlYTa coatings deposited by different thermal techniques,"In this paper, two coating techniques, the high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) and air plasma spray (APS) techniques, were used to deposit a bond coat of NiCoCrAlYTa on the Inconel 625 substrate, followed by applying a topcoat of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). The samples were preoxidized in an argon-controlled furnace at a temperature of 1000 °C for 12 and 24 h to characterize the microstructure of a thermally grown oxide (TGO) using the two coating techniques. The most suitable preoxidized samples were further tested for isothermal oxidation at 1000 °C for up to 120 h, and a hot corrosion test was performed at 1000 °C for up to 52 h or until spalling occurred. As-sprayed and oxidized samples prepared with different coating techniques were evaluated in terms of their microstructure using different characterization methods, such as field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), variable pressure scanning electron microscopy (VPSEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses. In addition, the mechanical properties of these samples were evaluated using adhesion tests. The results show that the YSZ/NiCoCrAlYTa coating applied with the HVOF technique forms a more thin and continuous layer of TGO than that obtained when applying a YSZ/NiCoCrAlYTa coating using the APS technique, indicating that a severe brittle oxidation interface exists between the two layers. The results also indicate that the mechanical strength obtained from the adhesion test of the coated samples is observably affected by the oxidation behaviors obtained with the different deposition techniques chosen.","Zulkifli, I.S.

Infrared-opacified Al2O3–SiO2 aerogel composites reinforced by SiC-coated mullite fibers for thermal insulations,"To opacify infrared radiation of mullite fiber-reinforced aerogel composites, SiC coatings were prepared on surfaces of mullite fibers by soaking with polycarbosilane (PCS) solution and then pyrolysis. By impregnating SiC-coated mullite fibers with Al2O3–SiO2 sol, then aging and supercritical drying, opacified Al2O3–SiO2 aerogel thermal insulation composites were prepared. The influences of the pyrolysis process on effective specific extinction coefficient and phase composition of the SiC-coated mullite fibers were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction analyses, and their relationship was discussed. The results indicate that the outer-layer coating is composed of β-SiC. When the concentration of the PCS solution was 10wt%, the effective specific extinction coefficient increased from less than 30.4 to about 56.3m2/kg in the wavelength range of 2.5–7.5μm. The thermal conductivity of Al2O3–SiO2 aerogel composites reinforced by SiC-coated fibers at 1000°C was 0.049W/mK, which was lower than that of composites reinforced by blank mullite fibers (0.062W/mK).","Xu, Lin;Jiang, Yonggang;Feng, Junzong;Feng, Jian;Yue, Chenwu",2015-01-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Effect of suspension stability on bonding strength and electrochemical behavior of electrophoretically deposited HA–YSZ nanostructured composite coatings,"In the present study, HA–YSZ nanostructured composites were deposited on Ti–6Al–4V substrates by electrophoretic deposition of suspensions containing 0, 10, 20 and 40wt% YSZ. The stability of each suspension was determined by applying response surface methodology, DLVO theory and zeta potential measurement for different YSZ contents and dispersant concentrations. The maximum zeta potential and electromobility of suspended particles was obtained for the suspension with 20wt% YSZ. The electrophoretic deposition of HA–YSZ nanostructured composites was carried out at a constant voltage of 20V for 120s. The deposition kinetics was studied based on a mass-charge correlating approach under ranges of voltage (20–60V), time (30–300s) and wt% YSZ (0–40). The as–deposited and sintered HA–YSZ coatings were characterized by SEM, XRD, DSC–TG and FT–IR analyses. The micro-scratch behavior of coated samples indicated the highest critical contact pressures of crack initiation, Pc1 = 4.50GPa, crack delamination, Pc2 = 5.14GPa and fracture toughness, KIC = 0.622MPam1/2 for HA-20wt% YSZ sample. The results of potentiodynamic polarization measurements showed that the implementation of 20wt% YSZ could efficiently decrease the corrosion current density and corrosion rate of coated samples, while corrosion potential and linear polarization resistance were increased.","Farnoush, Hamidreza;Rezaei, Zohreh",2017-10-15,Ceramics International,"Suspensions,Nanocomposites,Mechanical properties,Electrophoretic deposition",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.036,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.036
Preparation of MoSi2-SiC-Al2O3-SiO2 coating on mullite fibrous insulation with silica sol as binder by non-firing process,"High-emissivity MoSi2-SiC-Al2O3-SiO2 coating with MoSi2 and SiC as emittance agents, Al2O3 as base skeleton, and silica sol as both dispersive medium of the coating slurry and binder of the coating, was prepared on mullite fibrous insulations via slurry coating and non-firing process. The non-firing coatings were calcined at high temperatures to reveal their reusability after high temperature service. Microstructure, phase composition, interface bonding strength and impact resistance of the non-firing coating and the calcined coatings were investigated comprehensively. Thermal shock resistance, thermal endurance and infrared radiation property of the coatings were studied. The results show that the non-firing coating was dense and flat with all particles bonded together by silica sol; no clear interface existed between the coating and the substrate due to the penetration of the coating slurry; the whole coating was composed of a porous inner layer of about 300 µm in thickness and a top layer of about 100 µm in thickness. The calcined coatings exhibited ideal microstructure with newly formed high temperature phases. Both interface bonding strength and impact resistance of the calcined coatings increased with elevated calcination temperatures, benefited from the good binding effect of silica sol, the gradient structure and the formation of mullite. The coatings remained intact without peeling and spalling after thermal shock tests, and the main defects in the coating surface after thermal shock tests at 1400 °C and 1500 °C were cracks and holes, respectively. The coatings exhibited better long-term thermal endurance at 1400 °C than at 1500 °C, resulted from the weaker oxidation of emittance agents at lower temperature. The emissivity of the non-firing coating at the wavelength range of 3–5 µm and 8–12 µm was as high as 0.9, benefited from the non-firing process, and the emissivity of the calcined coatings were higher than 0.8.","Guo, Linlin;Tao, Xin;Gong, Zheng;Guo, Anran;Du, Haiyan;Liu, Jiachen",2019-02-01,Ceramics International,"Sol-gel processes (A),Microstructure-prefiring (B),Mechanical properties (C),Thermal applications (E)",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.197,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.197
Hydrophobic to hydrophilic surface transformation of nano-scale zinc ferrite via oleic acid coating: Magnetic hyperthermia study towards biomedical applications,"Nanoscale spinel zinc ferrite (ZNF) was prepared by sol-gel auto-ignition route and subsequently its surface was modified by oleic-acid (OA) coating. The pristine and surface modified ZNF nanoparticles (UC-ZNF and OA-ZNF) were characterized by standard techniques. XRD patterns of both the samples ensured the nanocrystalline mono-phasic cubic-spinel lattice structure with ‘Fd-3m space-group’. FT-IR spectra revealed the presence of vibrational frequency-modes of spinel structure and successful coating of OA over ZNF. The nano-size spherical grains with some agglomeration and OA coating over ZNF were visualized in FE-SEM images. The hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic surface-transition of ZNF was confirmed by water contact-angle measurements. The BET surface-area and distribution of pore-radius was evaluated by recording N2-isotherms. The M − H plots confirmed the superparamagnetic nature of both the samples. Optical properties were studied by UV–Vis and PL spectroscopy techniques. The colloidal-stability and distribution of particle-sizes were estimated by zeta-potential and DLS measurements. Magnetic hyperthermia studies were carried out for different concentrations (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 mg/mL) of both the samples. The biocompatible nature of both the samples was studied by cell-viability studies. All these results ensure the implementation of OA-ZNF nanoparticles with minimum dose rate (8 mg/mL) in magnetic hyperthermia therapies for cancer treatment.","Somvanshi, Sandeep B.;Kharat, Prashant B.;Khedkar, Mangesh V.;Jadhav, K.M.",2020-04-15,Ceramics International,"Surface modified ZnFe2O4,Hydrophilic surface,Magnetic hyperthermia,BET-BJH analysis,Superparamagnetic,Cell viability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.265,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.265

Composition and microstructure of a periclase–composite spinel brick used in the burning zone of a cement rotary kiln,"The composition and microstructure of a periclase–composite spinel brick used in the burning zone of a cement rotary kiln were investigated and compared to the original brick. The results indicate that cement clinker and alkali salts are two important agents that cause corrosion especially of the bonding phase of refractories in cement rotary kilns. When the molar ratio of alkalis to anions ((Na+K)/(Cl+2S)) is more than one, alkali salts accumulated in the pores, cracks and grain boundaries of the refractory but the severe corrosion of the bonding phase of the refractory did not occur in zones with lower temperatures. The interaction between the cement clinker and the refractory formed a liquid, which, together with alkali salts, improved sintering. The reaction between the cement clinker and the refractory formed a dense reaction layer. Cracks formed in the dense layer and extended through the boundary between the reaction and non-reaction (penetrated) layers by mechanical and thermal stress, which caused the spalling of the reaction and coating layer from the refractory. The recurrence of this process during service leads to degradation of the refractory.","Liu, Guangping;Li, Nan;Yan, Wen;Gao, Changhe;Zhou, Wei;Li, Yuanyuan",2014-07-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Synthesis and slurry spray coating of barium strontium alumino silicate on SiC substrate,"Barium strontium alumino silicate (BSAS); (Ba0.6Sr0.4Al2Si2O8) was synthesized through solid state reaction between BaCO3, SrCO3, Al2O3 and SiO2 subjected to wet milling in isopropanol for about 24 h. The sequence of the solid state reaction was studied by subjecting to DG/DTG from room temperature to 1550 °C. The crystallographic phase evolution was confirmed by X-ray diffraction of the powders calcined in the range 1000 to 1300 °C for 2 h. The monoclinic celsian phase obtained at 1300 °C, pelletized through uniaxial pressing was sinterable to 67 to 78% density in the temperature range of 1300 to 1500 °C. The density improved to 75 to 94% after ball milling for 76 h, while ZrO2 addition further improved the density by 2%. The celcian phase of BSAS was dispersed in isopropyl alcohol, milled for about 24 h and spray coated on to plain SiC and mullite precoated SiC substrates.

Dip-coating thin yttria-stabilized zirconia films for solid oxide fuel cell applications,"The preparation of high-quality yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte films on porous substrates is critical to the fabrication of high-performance solid-state ionic devices such as solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and gas sensors. In this paper, stable, fully dispersed YSZ suspensions were prepared. Particles zeta-potential and relative viscosity of suspensions were investigated. Thin YSZ films were deposited on NiO–YSZ anode supports with the YSZ suspensions and then heated to 1400°C in air. Dense and crack-free films were obtained with thickness in the range of 20–30μm.

Phase evolution and thermophysical properties of plasma sprayed thick zirconia coatings after annealing,"Yttria partially stabilized zirconia (YSZ) thick thermal barrier coatings were fabricated by Atmospheric Plasma Spraying (APS) and isothermally annealed at 1315°C for different durations. The phase composition of as-sprayed and heat-treated free-standing coatings was investigated by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and the Rietveld method was employed for quantitative phase analysis. High-temperature exposure of YSZ coatings produced the partial decomposition of metastable t′ zirconia phase and the corresponding increase in the amount of stable tetragonal t, cubic c and monoclinic m phases with increasing the aging time. The thermophysical properties of as-sprayed and annealed YSZ coatings, such as thermal expansion and heat capacity, were measured. The thermal expansion coefficient kept almost constant in-plane direction after heat treatment. Otherwise, it changed in through-thickness direction due to any structural changes and high-temperature sintering of the porous microstructure. The sintering also influenced the specific heat capacity C p which increased with increasing the annealing time.","Di Girolamo, Giovanni;Blasi, Caterina;Pagnotta, Leonardo;Schioppa, Monica",2010-12-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Oxidation behavior of TiC x N1−x coatings as a function of C/N ratio,"Titanium nitride, carbide and carbonitride coatings were synthesized on titanium substrates by the thermochemical diffusion process in ammonia, methane and varying compositions of ammonia/methane mixture, respectively. High temperature oxidation resistance of these coatings has been studied as a function of carbon to nitrogen ratio in the coatings. Oxidation experiments were conducted in a thermogravimetric analyzer in oxygen atmosphere at 800°C. XRD, SEM, EDS, XPS and Raman measurements before and after the oxidation studies revealed that the content of sp3 bonded carbon interspersed in the coatings plays a key role in deciding the oxidation resistance of the coatings. TiC with higher sp3 carbon showed maximum oxidation resistance and TiN the least. Incorporation of even a small amount of N in TiC and C in TiN is found to drastically alter their oxidation resistance.","Ajikumar, P.K.;Kamruddin, M.;Ravindran, T.R.;Kalavathi, S.;Tyagi, A.K.",2014-08-31,Ceramics International,"Oxidation,Raman analysis,Scanning electron microscopy,Thermogravimetry,Titanium carbonitride",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.03.027,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.03.027
Thermal stability of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and YSZ-Al2O3 coatings,"The thermal insulation performance of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and YSZ-Al2O3 coatings deposited by atmospheric plasma spraying was evaluated using a thermal shock simulator, revealing the superiority of YSZ-Al2O3 coatings due to their lower thermal conductivity. Furthermore, YSZ-Al2O3 coatings were more thermally stable than YSZ ones, as determined by scanning electron microscopy, electron backscatter diffraction, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses. Detailed investigations revealed that heating induces partial removal of Y from ZrO2, weakening its stabilization and thus leading to a martensitic phase transformation of metastable tetragonal zirconia (t′-ZrO2) into monoclinic zirconia (m-ZrO2). Conversely, in YSZ-Al2O3 coatings, Al diffused into t′-ZrO2 to further stabilize it by forming an YSZ-Al2O3 solid solution, thus slowing down the above phase transformation.","Song, Xuemei;Liu, Ziwei;Kong, Mingguang;Lin, Chucheng;Huang, Liping;Zheng, Xuebin;Zeng, Yi",2017-11-30,Ceramics International,"YSZ coating,YSZ-Al2O3 coating,Thermal insulation,Thermal stability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.186,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.186
Effects of water content and sol viscosity on morphology of porous silica thermal insulating layer,"Amorphous porous silica thin films as a thermal insulating layer in pyroelectric infrared (IR) detector were prepared by a modified sol–gel method. These silica films possessed sponge-like disordered pore structure. The effects of water content and sol viscosity on morphology of the films were investigated. The results shown: with decreasing water content and increasing sol viscosity, the pore size, root-mean-square surface roughness (RMSSR), and thickness of the films increased obviously. However, the porosity did not change greatly. While the values of the water content and the sol viscosity changed from 91.69 to 79.58wt.% and 5.59 to 59.37cP, respectively, the thickness of single layer film increased from 0.34 to 1.50μm, and the values of porosity just fluctuated between 45 and 50%. A crack-free, uniform porous silica films with porosity of 45% and thickness of 15μm also could be obtained by repeating coating procedure easily.","Wu, Xiaoqing;Yao, Xi;Wang, Minqiang;Gao, Lumei",2004-12-31,Ceramics International,"Porous silica films,Modified sol–gel method,Water content,Sol viscosity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2003.12.184,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2003.12.184
Microstructure and mechanical properties of plasma sprayed TiC/Ti5Si3/Ti3SiC2 composite coatings with Al additions,"The mass production of MAX phase coatings such as Ti3SiC2 and Ti3AlC2 using the plasma spraying method is highly challenging due to its ultra-high temperature and short reaction time. In this study, agglomerate powders of 3Ti/SiC/C/xAl with various Al contents (x = 0–1.5) were prepared to form TiC/Ti5Si3/Ti3SiC2 composite coatings using the plasma spraying technique. The effect of the Al addition on the microstructures and mechanical performances of the as-sprayed coatings was investigated. The addition of Al decreased the TiC content of the coatings while increasing their Ti3SiC2 content significantly. The addition of even small amounts of Al improved the MAX phase fraction of the coatings from 8.95 wt% (x = 0) to 34.05 wt% (x = 0.2) and 41.60 wt% (x = 0.5). Excess Al did not affect the Ti3SiC2 content of the coatings. The composite coatings showed a lamellar structure with pores and microcracks. With the addition of Al, the microhardness of the coatings increased slightly, while the fracture toughness improved significantly. The composite coatings with Al showed better wear resistance than those without Al. The wear mechanism of the coatings was a combination of adhesive wear, abrasive wear, and oxidative wear.","Zhang, Fanyong;Zhao, Liping;Yan, Shu;He, Jining;Yin, Fuxing",2020-07-31,Ceramics International,"MAX phases,Plasma spraying,Composites,Microstructure,Mechanical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.187,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.187
Structural and electrical study of highly (100)-oriented KNN films fabricated by a sol-gel non-alkoxide process,"Fabricating of highly-oriented pure-phase potassium sodium niobate (KNN) films on traditional Si substrates by low-cost manageable sol-gel technique (especially with non-alcohol niobium salt Nb2O5 as niobium source) is still a work of great challenge. Here, KNN films were prepared on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si and LNO/Si substrates via a sol-gel non-alkoxide process. And a comprehensive set of experimental investigations to the role of the bottom electrode, annealing atmosphere and the number of coating layers on the microstructures and electrical properties involution of spin-coated KNN films were made. The crystal structures, preferential orientation and morphology of KNN films are strongly affected by the annealing atmosphere, as well as the bottom electrode material. KNN films annealed in air show an obviously better crystal structure and denser surface than that annealed in oxygen, and KNN film spin-coated on LNO bottom electrode and annealed in air exhibits a dominant (h00) orientation with a high preferred degree of 93.6%. In addition, it also can be found that the increasing number of coating layers of KNN films also results in better crystalline structures (higher oriented degree, larger grains, narrower FWHM) and electrical performance. KNN film with 18 layers shows the largest dielectric constant of 868 and the lowest loss tangent of 2.8%.","Zhang, Wei;Zhu, Haiyong;Zhang, Xuehua;Wu, Hao;Bao, Jianqiu;Hu, Fangren",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"KNN thin films,Nb2O5,Sol-gel non-alkoxide process,Coating layers,Orientation/texturing",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.234,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.234
Green preparation of in situ Cr3C2 nano-coatings on graphite surface and their water-wettability and rheological properties,"Cr3C2 coatings were successfully prepared on the surface of graphite flakes via a molten salt route by mixing Cr powders with natural graphite flakes in a binary LiCl-KCl salt at 450–950 °C for 4–12 h. The phases and microstructures of the coatings were verified by its XRD/XPS spectra and SEM/AFM observations, respectively. Together with the dissolution/dispersion evidence of chromium powders after interaction with the salt, and the slightly increased particle sizes due to the formation of Cr3C2 coatings on graphite flakes, a ‘template-growth’ kinetic process was therefore proposed on the formation of such coatings in the molten salt. The resultant coatings decreased the contact angle between water and graphite from 101° to ~ 75° and lowered the apparent viscosities of graphite water slurry by two orders of magnitude accordingly, suggesting that the coatings will afford graphite with good processing abilities for carbon-water based materials.","Liu, Xiaoguang;Zhang, Shaowei;Li, Yan",2018-06-01,Ceramics International,"Molten salt(A),Coatings (B),Rheology (C),Water-wettability (C),Graphite (D),Cr3C2 (D)",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.172,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.172
Synthesis and photoluminescence properties of erbium oxide thin films prepared by sol-gel method,"This study used the sol-gel reaction to synthesize an erbium oxide precursor. The precursor was coated on a hydrophilic SiO2/Si substrate by using spin coating technology, which was then processed at the temperature of 600–1100°C for 45min to form erbium oxide and erbium silicate thin films. The film obtained from a 600°C reaction is smooth and crack-free, and it binds well to the substrate. A grazing incidence X-ray diffractometer, scanning electron microscope, and photoluminescence spectrometer were used to analyze the material structure, appearance, and optical properties of each film that was obtained and to compare the effects of different reaction conditions on material structure and optical properties. The results indicated that the Er2O3 films fabricated by 1000°C annealing will subsequently form Er2SiO5 after reacting with SiO2 and were characterized by optimal luminescent properties, which made them applicable for use in future optoelectronic devices.","Chang, Yu-Hsu;Chou, Mei-Hua;Wang, Tzyy-Jiann",2018-01-31,Ceramics International,"Sol-gel,Erbium oxide,Erbium silicate,Thin film,Photoluminescence",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.099,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.099
"Nanostructured TaC film deposited by reactive magnetron sputtering: Influence of gas concentration on structural, mechanical, wear and corrosion properties","TaC coatings were applied on the surface of the AISI316L stainless steel by reactive magnetron sputtering, and the effects of CH 4 concentrations ( C CH 4 = 0 , 5 , 10 , 20 and 30) on the structural, mechanical, wear and corrosion behavior were investigated. According to the dominant phase structure, deposited films classified into three categories; namely, metallic (Ta phase), ceramic (TaC phase) and amorphous (amorphous carbon phase). Increasing the C CH 4 from 0% to 20%, hardness (H) and elastic modulus (E) of the coatings increased from 6.2 and 115.6 GPa to 27.6 and 274.2 GPa, respectively. Further increase in C CH 4 led to decrease H and E to 1.5 and 16.3 GPa, respectively. Based on nanoindentation and pin on disk test results, in ceramic coatings due to high coating to substrate hardness ratio, the resistance of the coating against elastic ( H / E ) and plastic ( H 3 / E 2 ) deformation are the key factors in the determination of wear behavior. It is to say, the coating deposited at C CH 4 = 20 % showing the H / E = 0.101 and H 3 / E 2 = 0.28 had the highest wear resistance, while the coating deposited at C CH 4 = 10 % with the H / E = 0.068 and H 3 / E 2 = 0.084 showed the lowest wear resistance. Tafel and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were also used to investigate the corrosion behavior of the samples. Results showed that the films deposited at C CH 4 = 5 and 10% display the best protective properties, which was attributed to lower porosity index.","Poladi, A.;Semnani, H.R.

A simple route to produce tungsten carbide powders by high-energy ball milling and annealing,"Tungsten carbide powders are extensively used to provide wear-resistance properties to metal-matrix coatings. Here, we propose a simple and efficient route for the production of WC powders from elemental W and C by room-temperature high-energy ball milling (HEBM) and subsequent annealing. WC powders were obtained, with a minor (<4%wt.) iron contamination, with only 4 h of milling of a W/C atomic mixture of 42/58 and 90min anneal at 1000 °C. This innovative and simple route to produce WC powders can be used to produce feedstock of reinforcing particles intended for wear resistant coatings. We explored the impact of the milling times (from 6min to 96 h), compositions (W:C ratio of 1, 1.17 and 1.38) and annealing conditions ranging from 4 h at 850 °C to 90 min at 1000 °C. The samples were analyzed for phase distribution and composition using XRD, SEM with EDX mapping, XRF and TGA. As expected, milling induces amorphization and introduces iron from the milling media. We show that an excess of C can efficiently suppress the formation of deleterious tungsten carbides.","Fernique, R.M.T.;Savoie, S.;Gariépy, M.;Braidy, N.;Schulz, R.",2020-02-01,Ceramics International,"Tungsten carbide,Mechanical alloying,X-ray diffraction,SEM",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.147,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.147
AlF3-modified LiCoPO4 for an advanced cathode towards high energy lithium-ion battery,"Surface-interface reaction between the electrode and electrolyte plays a key role in lithium-ion storage properties, especially for high voltage cathode such as LiCoPO4 and Ni-riched cathode. Generally, surface modification is an effective method to improve the electrochemical performance of electrode materials. Herein, in order to revise the LiCoPO4 cathode with desirable properties, uniform AlF3-modified LiCoPO4 (LiCoPO4@AlF3) cathode materials in nano-sized distribution are synthesized. XRD result indicates that there is no structural transformation observed after AlF3 coating. TEM characterization and XPS analysis reveal that the surface of LiCoPO4 particle is coated by a nano-sized uniform AlF3 layer. Further, the electrochemical results indicate that AlF3 layer significantly improves the cycling and rate performances of LiCoPO4 cathode within the voltage range of 3.0–5.0V. After a series of optimization, 4mol% AlF3-coated LiCoPO4 material exhibits the best properties including an initial discharge capacity of 159mAhg−1 at 0.1C with 91% capacity retention after 50 cycles, especially a discharge capacity of 90mAhg−1 can be obtained at 1C rate. CV curves indicate that the polarization of cathode is reduced by AlF3 layer and EIS curves reveal that AlF3 layer relieves the increase of resistance to facilitate Li-ion transfer at the interface between electrode and electrolyte during the cycling process. The enhanced electrochemical performances are attributed to that the AlF3 layer can stabilize the interface between the cathode and electrolyte, form steady SEI film and suppress the electrolyte continuous decomposition at 5V high voltages. This feasible strategy and novel characteristics of LiCoPO4@AlF3 could promise the prospective applications in the stat-art of special lithium-ion battery with high energy and/or power density.","Wang, Yue;Qiu, Jingyi;Yu, Zhongbao;Ming, Hai;Li, Meng;Zhang, Songtong;Yang, Yusheng",2018-02-01,Ceramics International,"Li-ion battery,High voltage,LiCoPO4,Surface modification,AlF3 coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.084,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.084
Effect of initial cure time on toughness of geopolymer matrix composites,"The toughness of geopolymer matrix composites (GMC) has been identified as a limiting factor to their use in structural applications. Advanced ceramic matrix composites (CMC), which also are limited by brittle behavior, have shown gains in toughness through careful tailoring of the interface between fiber and matrix. This can create various crack dissipating mechanisms and prevent premature composite failure. Such interface modification has already been applied to a fiber reinforced geopolymer and while the resulting composite showed a reduction in brittle behavior, the modified interface produced an unacceptable loss in modulus without any other well-defined quantitative gains. Information gathered from other studies suggests the large decrease in modulus observed in the GMCs with the weakened interface may have been the result of poor matrix properties stemming from an inadequate cure. Therefore, this current study explores the effects of initial cure time on composite performance by measuring the mechanical properties GMCs with a modified interface. GMCs containing unidirectional Nextel 610 fiber were cured under two different sets of process conditions to better understand the influence of matrix properties. Additionally, specimens consisted of cleaned and carbon coated fiber surfaces, in an attempt to evaluate extremes of interfacial strength. Mechanical properties were then evaluated for comparison to determine if improved geopolymer matrix properties would allow a weakened interface to yield performance gains more in keeping with expectations based on CMC's. The results of the study indicate that specimens with carbon coating benefited from the longer initial cure time. The average increase in flexural modulus and strength over samples with one hour initial cure time was ~65% and ~170% respectively. Stress-strain behavior of the carbon-coated specimens with an extended cure time also indicated a greater degree of damage tolerance as compared to those without interphase.","Jackson, Patrick R.;Radford, Donald W.",2017-09-30,Ceramics International,"Geopolymer,Fiber coating,Ceramic matrix composite,Interphase",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.173,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.173
"Effect of holding time on microstructure, mechanical, water resistance and dielectric properties of α-cordierite glass-ceramic coating on porous BN/Si2N2O ceramic","α-cordierite glass-ceramic coating was prepared on the porous BN/Si2N2O ceramic by the glass-ceramic method at 1050 °C for 1–4 h. The effect of the holding time on the phase composition, microstructure, mechanical, water resistance and dielectric properties of the glass-ceramic coating was investigated. The resulting coating was mainly composed of α-cordierite and glass, and the α-cordierite content increased with increasing holding time. The coating/substrate interface was continuous without defects, and the glass liquid of the coating can infiltrated into the surface pores of the substrate. Additionally, the density and mechanical properties of coatings increased as the holding time increased. The obtained coated samples fabricated at 1050 °C for 2–4 h possessed a low water absorption (2.1–5%) and little open porosity (2.7–3.2%), demonstrating good water resistance. Furthermore, the coated samples prepared at 1050 °C for 3 or 4 h exhibited both low dielectric constant (4.1–4.3) and loss tangent (0.005–0.009) in the frequency range of 20–36 GHz.","Sun, Yangshan;Cai, Delong;Yang, Zhihua;Li, Hailiang;Liao, Xingqi;Jia, Dechang;Zhou, Yu",2018-09-30,Ceramics International,"α-cordierite,Glass-ceramic coating,Interface,Water resistance,Dielectric properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.251,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.251
The effects of TiO2 sol concentration on single- and multiple-scratch damage in electroplated Ni–B-TiO2 sol composite coating,"The electrodeposited sol-enhanced Ni–B–TiO2 composite coatings were elaborated using a novel electroplating process. This coating was assessed in terms of tribological behavior and corrosion resistance. However, the adhesion strength of this coating has not been discussed so far. The aim of this study is to evaluate the adhesion behavior of this coating, considering different TiO2 sol concentration in the plating solution in order to predict its effectiveness and its sustainability when used in mineral crushing process. A progressive load scratch test and multi-pass scratch test were performed on coatings. The morphology of scratched surfaces was analyzed to identify the scratch failure mechanism. The results indicate that the addition of TiO2 sol significantly enhanced the deposit adhesion to the substrate compared to pure Ni–B coating. No spallation failure was observed on the sol-enhanced coatings after progressive load scratch test, contrary to Ni–B coating. Moreover, the multi-pass scratch test demonstrated that the improvement in adhesion strength depends strongly on the quantity of the TiO2 sol added to the plating solution. For the optimal concentration of TiO2 sol (25 ml/L), the sol-enhanced Ni–B–TiO2sol composite coating boasts the best adhesion strength. However, further increase in TiO2 sol concentration results in a deterioration of coating adhesion.","Kallel, Mouna;Masseoud, Mouna;Vesco, Silvia;Barletta, Massimiliano;Elleuch, Khaled",2020-02-15,Ceramics International,"Mineral crushing operation,TiO2 sol,Scratch response,Failure mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.099,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.099
Influence of fibres diameter on the AC and DC magnetic characteristics of Fe/Fe3O4 fibres based soft magnetic composites,"Fibres-based soft magnetic composites (FSMCs) have been prepared by using Fe fibres of different diameters (65, 125, 250 and 500 μm). The Fe fibres were coated with a 3 μm thick layer of Fe3O4 via the blackening process and subsequently compacted at 700 MPa. The X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) was used to prove the formation of the Fe3O4 coating on the surface of the fibres. The thickness and the uniformity of the coating were analysed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The DC measurements performed on the composite cores revealed that the saturation induction increase from 1.36 to 1.68 T, the maximum relative permeability increase from 550 to 940, and the coercive field decrease from 796 to 454 A/m as the fibre's diameter increase from 65 to 500 μm. By using thinner fibres (65 and 125 μm), composites with low losses and stable initial relative permeability, in the frequency range 50 Hz–10 kHz, can be obtained. To distinguish between different types of losses dissipated by our compacts, and the influence of the fibre's diameter on the different components of the total losses, a numerical model for loss separation is proposed. The comparative evolution of the AC magnetic characteristics of the FSMCs and powder-based SMCs is presented. According to the presented results, this new type of composites can be successfully used to prepare magnetic cores designated to work in the medium to high-frequency range.","Neamţu, B.V.;Pszola, M.;Opriş, A.;Popa, F.;Marinca, T.F.;Chicinaş, I.",2020-09-02,Ceramics International,"Soft magnetic composites,Fibres-based composites,Fe3O4 coating,Fibres diameter,Loss separation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.015
"Er,Cr:YSGG laser irradiation influence on Y-TZP bond strength to resin cement","The aim of this study was to evaluate Y-TZP surface pretreatment with different protocols on microshear bond strength (μSBS) ceramic-cement interface. One hundred and sixty pre-sintered IPS e-max ZirCAD (Ivoclar-Vivadent) blocks were randomly divided into sixteen groups according to surface treatment (n=20): G1- no treatment (control); G2- ceramic primer; G3- tribochemical silica coating; G4- tribochemical silica coating+primer; G5- airborne particle abrasion (Al2O3); G6- airborne particle abrasion (Al2O3)+primer; G7- Er,Cr:YSGG laser; G8- Er,Cr:YSGG laser+primer. All specimens were sintered before surface treatment, except lasers groups, which were sintered after laser irradiation. Ceramic blocks were bonded with Panavia F resin cement (Kuraray, Okayama, Japan) (n=10) or RelyX ARC (3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA) (n=10). The μSBS tests were carried out in a universal testing machine at a speed of 1mm/min after 24h (n=5) or 6 months storage (n=5). Differences were found for both resin cements and storage conditions in relation to μSBS values (p<0.05). However, no significant difference for interaction between factors was observed in cemented blocks with RelyX ARC. Panavia F resin cement showed significant differences for interaction between factors (p<0.05). Laser treatment was not sufficient to increase μSBS values between Y-TZP and resin cements. Tribochemical silica coating followed by primer achieved the highest immediate μSBS values. The storage did not affect negatively μSBS values to both evaluated cements.","Aras, Wanessa M.F.;Barroso, Juliana S.M.;Blay, Alberto;Rodrigues, José Augusto;Cassoni, Alessandra",2016-09-30,Ceramics International,"Zirconia,Bond strength,Er,Cr:YSGG laser",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.180,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.180
Porosity analysis and oxidation behavior of plasma sprayed YSZ and YSZ/LaPO4 abradable thermal barrier coatings,"In this research, the high temperature oxidation behavior, porosity, and microstructure of four abradable thermal barrier coatings (ATBCs) consisting of micro- and nanostructured YSZ, YSZ-10%LaPO4, and YSZ-20%LaPO4 coatings produced by atmospheric (APS) method were evaluated. Results show that the volume percentage of porosity in the coatings containing LaPO4 was higher than the monolithic YSZ sample. It was probably due to less thermal conductivity of LaPO4 phases. Furthermore, the results showed that the amount of the remaining porosity in the composite coatings was higher than the monolithic YSZ at 1000°C for 120h. After 120h isothermal oxidation, the thickness of thermally growth oxide (TGO) layer in composite coatings was higher than that of YSZ coating due to higher porosity and sintering resistance of composite coatings. Finally, the isothermal oxidation resistance of conventional YSZ and nanostructured YSZ coating was investigated.","Hajian Foroushani, Mohsen;Shamanian, Morteza;Salehi, Mehdi;Davar, Fatemeh",2016-11-01,Ceramics International,"Yttria stabilized zirconia,LaPO4,Porosity,Oxidation behavior,Abradable,Nano-and microstructured,Thermal barrier coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.057,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.057
Synthesis of macroporous Li4SiO4 via a citric acid-based sol–gel route coupled with carbon coating and its CO2 chemisorption properties,"A highly efficient lithium orthosilicate (CSG-Li4SiO4) was synthesized using a sol–gel method combined with carbon coating. The presence of citric acid played dual roles, serving as a complexing agent that homogeneously mixed the precursors and as a carbon source, which effectively prevented the Li4SiO4 crystallite from growing. The sorbent characteristics, CO2 absorption capacity, and cyclic absorption–desorption properties of CSG-Li4SiO4 were determined using X-ray diffraction, nitrogen absorption, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and a fixed-bed reactor. Compared with two reference sorbents synthesized using the solid-state method and a simple sol–gel without carbon coating, CSG-Li4SiO4 presented a loose shell-connected structure with higher purity, smaller grain size and larger specific surface area. This favorable structure was responsible for the sorbent׳s improved performance, as indicated by a higher capacity (a maximum absorption of 34.2wt%), faster absorption kinetics and better stability.","Wang, Ke;Yin, Zeguang;Zhao, Pengfei",2016-02-01,Ceramics International,"CO2,Carbon coating,Citric acid,Li4SiO4",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.10.083,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.10.083
Nanoindentation study of microplasma sprayed hydroxyapatite coating,"The microplasma sprayed (MPS) hydroxyapatite (HAP) coating on surgical grade SS316L, is an emerging material for bio-ceramic based implant application involving higher reliability. For this purpose, a 200μm thick MPS-HAP coating was developed on SS316L substrate and characterized by XRD, SEM and FE-SEM techniques. The local mechanical properties of the coating, e.g. nano-hardness and Young's modulus were evaluated by nanoindentation technique carried out with a Berkovich indenter at various depths in the range of about 170–3000nm on a polished top surface. The characteristic values of nano-hardness (1.5–5GPa) and Young's modulus (∼60–100GPa) obtained through the application of Weibull statistics to the experimentally measured data revealed a strong indentation size effect (ISE). Attempts were made to explain the genesis of ISE on the basis of some existing and some new concepts.","Dey, A.;Mukhopadhyay, A.K.;Gangadharan, S.;Sinha, M.K.;Basu, D.;Bandyopadhyay, N.R.",2009-08-31,Ceramics International,"A.

"Polydimethylsiloxanes-modified TiO2 coatings: The role of structural, morphological and optical characteristics in a self-cleaning surface","The surface modification of TiO2 thin film with hydrophobic agents has been a good strategy for modulation properties of this versatile material, allowing it to be compatible with a wider range of applications. This is a promising approach in the developing of improved self-cleaning materials; since films prepared with this modification are expected to exhibit photocatalytic and hydrophobic properties. However, these strategies still need to be improved, seeking the design of hydrophobic and photocatalytic structures through faster and simpler procedures, using non-fluorinated polymers. This work proposed the synthesis and characterization of self-cleaning coatings, involving a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/TiO2 system. TiO2 thin films were modified with two different types of PDMS: hydroxyl and vinyl-terminated – and prepared by two distinct routes: Route A, which involved a modified TiO2 sol-gel process, and route B, consisting in the functionalization of TiO2 films after their calcination. Each route was best suited for a different type of PDMS. The PDMS modification occurred by a covalent linkage, which can allow a better durability of the functionalization on TiO2 surface. In some cases, the functionalization was heterogeneous and promoted a significant increase in surface roughness, allowing these samples to present hydrophobicity and photocatalytic activity.","Neves, Juliana C.;Mohallem, Nelcy D.S.;Viana, Marcelo M.",2020-06-01,Ceramics International,"TiO2 thin film,Hydrophobic agents,Heterogeneous functionalization,Photocatalytic activity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.190,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.190
A prospective material for orthopedic applications: Ti substrates coated with a composite coating of a titania-nanotubes layer and a silver-manganese-doped hydroxyapatite layer,"Orthopedic implants need to be coated with biomedical coatings that can facilitate osseointegration and mitigate bacterial biofilm formation. Using anodisation and electrodeposition techniques, we modified Ti implants with a double-layer coating made of TiO2 nanotubes (TNT) and hydroxyapatite that was codoped with silver and manganese (AgMnHA). The silver incorporation into hydroxyapatite improves its antimicrobial properties, and the manganese doping offsets the potential cytotoxicity of the incorporated silver. The AgMnHA and the TNT films were characterized with X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results highlight that the manganese and silver ions were evenly incorporated into the AgMnHA/TiO2 coating. Its adhesion strength significantly increased because of the interlocking of the rough TiO2 layer with the bioceramic particles that entered into the voids of the TiO2 nanotubes. The coating decreases the corrosion current density of titanium from 3.71μA to 0.19μA, and increases its corrosion resistance by almost two orders of magnitude. The coating can continuously release silver ions into the bacterial suspension, resulting in excellent antimicrobial efficacy with a 100% reduction in viable cells. Both hydroxyapatite and the AgMnHA/TiO2 coating are super-hydrophilic; meanwhile, if immersed in a simulated body fluid, they could induce the deposition of typical spherical apatite. In-vitro cell culture tests demonstrated that hydroxyapatite and the AgMnHA/TiO2 coating considerably improved the cell viability and the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Therefore, the AgMnHA coating has no significant cytotoxicity on osteoblasts, and could generate sufficient osteoblast differentiation for osseointegration. We therefore find that a bilayer AgMnHA/TiO2 coating on Ti implants improves antibiofilm properties that does not offset the hydroxyapatite biocompatibility that is needed for successful osseointegration and bone healing.","Huang, Yong;Wang, Wendong;Zhang, Xuejiao;Liu, Xiaoting;Xu, Zhiwei;Han, Shuguang;Su, Zhuobin;Liu, Huiying;Gao, Yuan;Yang, Hejie",2018-04-01,Ceramics International,"Manganese,Silver,HA coating,Antibacterial property,Cytotoxicity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.197,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.197
Mechanical properties and calcium-magnesium-alumino-silicate (CMAS) corrosion behavior of a promising Hf6Ta2O17 ceramic for thermal barrier coatings,"Hf6Ta2O17 ceramics are successfully prepared by solid state reaction and pressureless sintering. The mechanical properties and the calcium-magnesium-alumino-silicate (CMAS) corrosion behavior of Hf6Ta2O17 ceramics are studied. The hardness, elastic modulus and fracture toughness of Hf6Ta2O17 ceramics are 18.45 GPa, 273.42 GPa and 2.6–3.1 MPa m1/2, respectively. As the Hf6Ta2O17 ceramics are attacked by CMAS, the reaction layer and dense layer are formed on the ceramic surface, which prevents the further infiltration of molten CMAS. HfSiO4 and Ca2Hf7O16 are confirmed as the main reaction products of Hf6Ta2O17 and CMAS. Hf6Ta2O17 ceramics exhibit better CMAS corrosion resistance than 8 wt% yttria stabilized zirconia (8YSZ) ceramics, which is attributed to the dense structure formed by corrosion products (hafnium tantalum oxide and Ca2Hf7O16) and lower theoretical optical basicity (OB) value. Furthermore, Hf6Ta2O17/YSZ double ceramic top coat thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are successfully prepared by plasma spraying, and the thermal cycling performance is investigated. Hf6Ta2O17/YSZ double-layers TBCs has good thermal cycling performance as 8YSZ single-layer TBCs.","Tan, Z.Y.;Yang, Z.H.;Zhu, W.;Yang, L.;Zhou, Y.C.;Hu, X.P.",2020-11-30,Ceramics International,"Hf6Ta2O17 ceramic,CMAS corrosion,Hardness,Elastic modulus,Fracture toughness",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.316,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.316
Electrochemical performance of intermediate temperature micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells using porous ceria barrier layers,"We describe the manufacture and electrochemical characterization of micro-tubular anode supported solid oxide fuel cells (mT-SOFC) operating at intermediate temperatures (IT) using porous gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC: Ce0.9Gd0.1O2−δ ) barrier layers. Rheological studies were performed to determine the deposition conditions by dip coating of the GDC and cathode layers. Two cell configurations (anode/electrolyte/barrier layer/cathode): single-layer cathode (Ni–YSZ/YSZ/GDC/LSCF) and double-layer cathode (Ni–YSZ/YSZ/GDC/LSCF–GDC/LSCF) were fabricated (YSZ: Zr0.92Y0.16O2.08; LSCF: La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3−δ ). Effect of sintering conditions and microstructure features for the GDC layer and cathode layer in cell performance was studied. Current density–voltage (j–V) curves and impedance spectroscopy measurements were performed between 650–800°C, using wet H2 as fuel and air as oxidant. The double-cathode cells using a GDC layer sintered at 1400°C with porosity about 50% and pores and grain sizes about 1μm, showed the best electrochemical response, achieving maximum power densities of up to 160mWcm−2 at 650°C and about 700mWcm−2 at 800°C. In this case GDC electrical bridges between cathode and electrolyte are preserved free of insulating phases. A preliminary test under operation at 800°C shows no degradation at least during the first 100h. These results demonstrated that these cells could compete with standard IT-SOFC, and the presented fabrication method is applicable for industrial-scale.","López-Robledo, M.J.;Laguna-Bercero, M.A.;Silva, J.;Orera, V.M.;Larrea, A.",2015-07-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Solution combustion synthesis of calcia-magnesia-aluminosilicate powder and its interaction with yttria-stabilized zirconia and co-doped yttria-stabilized zirconia,"Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBCs) play a significant role in improving the efficiency of gas turbines by increasing their operating temperatures. The TBCs in advanced turbine engines are prone to silicate particles attack while operating at high temperatures. The silicate particles impinge on the hot TBC surfaces and melt to form calcia-magnesia-aluminosilicate (CMAS) glass deposits leading to coating premature failure. Fine powder of CMAS with the composition matching the desert sand has been synthesized by solution combustion technique. The present study also demonstrates the preparation of flowable yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and cluster paired YSZ (YSZ-Ln2O3, Ln = Dy and Gd) powders by single-step solution combustion technique. The as-synthesized powders have been plasma sprayed and the interaction of the free standing TBCs with CMAS at high-temperatures (1200 °C, 1270 °C and 1340 °C for 24 h) has been investigated.

"Microstructure and friction coefficient of ceramic (TiC, TiN and B4C) reinforced Ni-based coating by laser cladding","Ni204 ceramic composite coatings with different mass fractions of TiC, TiN and B4C were successfully prepared on the surface of 45 steel by laser cladding. Microstructures of different ceramic coatings were studied using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and laser confocal microscopy. The friction coefficient and microhardness of ceramic coatings were measured with a reciprocating friction wear machine and microhardness tester. The results show that ceramic coating has 766.8HV0.5 average microhardness and friction coefficient of 0.47 when 10%TiC, TiN, and B4C are added to initial powder Ni204. The microstructure of cladding layer is uniform and compact, and the microhardness and friction coefficient of the coating increased and decreased by factors 2.6 and 1.393 compared with initial powder. This is due to the presence of multiple phase ((Ti, Mo, Nb) (C, B, N)), carbide, nitride, (Ti, Mo, Nb) (C, B, N), and (Ti, Mo, Nb) (C, N) ring phase around TiC, TiN, and Ti(C, N) ceramic phases. Uniformly distributed reinforced phases in the coating inhibit extrusion by grinding balls on the surface of the ceramic coating, thus changing original abrasive wear mechanism, making wear marks more shallow, and decreasing friction coefficient of the surface.","Zhao, Yu;Yu, Tianbiao;Guan, Chuang;Sun, Jiayu;Tan, Xuefei",2019-11-30,Ceramics International,"Laser cladding,B4C/TiC/TiN ceramic coating,Microstructure,Microhardness,Friction coefficient",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.070,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.070

The optimized Cu-doped LiFePO4/C exhibited a high specific capacity of 148mAhg−1 at 0.1C. Even at a rate of 10C, it still achieved a specific capacity of 111mAhg−1 and its capacity retention ratio remained at 99.9% after 100 cycles at 1C. These enhanced electrochemical properties were mainly due to a lesser extent of particle aggregation and more uniform carbon coating.

Moreover, the silicon concentration, grains size, and coating thickness increase gradually with the increasing temperature. The surfaces silicon concentrations are about 68–75 wt%, the average grains sizes of MoSi2 columnar crystals are about 7.1–9.4 µm, and the coating thicknesses are about 28–35 µm.","Zhang, Yingyi;Ni, Wenjie;Li, Yungang",2018-07-31,Ceramics International,"Mo–MoSi2,Temperature,Siliconizing,Microstructure,Functionally graded materials",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.136,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.136
Scale-progressive healing mechanism dominating the ultrafast initial sintering kinetics of plasma-sprayed thermal barrier coatings,"The thermal insulating performance of plasma-sprayed thermal barrier coatings (PS-TBCs) depends dominantly on inter-splat pores, which would be inevitably healed during high temperature exposure. The sintering kinetics of TBCs appears to be highly stage-sensitive. However, the ultrafast sintering kinetics during the initial sintering stage is not yet well understood. In this study, the sintering behavior of PS-TBCs was investigated in a scale-progressive (from nano- to micro-scale) way. Moreover, a novel healing mechanism suitable for lamellar TBCs was proposed based on a combined-effect of material and pore structure. Regarding the changing behavior of material, nano-scale roughening can be found at the as-deposited smooth pore surface after thermal exposure. Regarding the 2D featured inter-splat pores, the roughening behavior facilitates multiple contacts between the counter-surfaces of inter-splat pores. As a result, micro-scale bridge-connection can be observed at the healed parts. This multiple contacts mechanism caused by scale-progressive healing behavior significantly accelerated the matter transfer, resulting in ultrafast sintering kinetics at the initial sintering stage.","Li, Guang-Rong;Xie, Hua;Yang, Guan-Jun",2018-10-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings (TBC),Plasma spraying,Ultrafast sintering kinetics,Multiple contacts,Scale-progressive healing mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.102,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.102
"Development and protection evaluation of two new, advanced ceramic composite thermal spray coatings, Al2O3–40TiO2 and Cr3C2–20NiCr on carbon steel petroleum oil piping","Carbon steel is the most commonly used material in the petroleum industry owing to its high performance and relatively low cost compared with highly alloyed materials. The corrosion resistance of carbon steel in aqueous solutions is dependent on the surface layer created on carbon steel. This layer often consists of siderite (FeCO3) and cementite (Fe3C), but it is neither compact nor dense. To improve the carbon steel surface resistance against corrosion and wear, a compact and dense layer can be deposited onto the surface by thermal spray coating. In this research, Al2O3–40TiO2 and Cr3C2–20NiCr were deposited onto mechanical part surfaces by HVOF spray technique. The present study describes and compares the electrochemical behavior of carbon steel, Cr3C2–20NiCr and Al2O3–40TiO2 in 3.5% NaCl using open-circuit potential measurement (OCP) and electrochemical impedance microscopy (EIS) for 36 days. The tribological and mechanical properties are also investigated using a tribometer (pin-on-disc). The results indicate that these chemical composition coatings facilitated significant anti-corrosion and anti-wear improvement. However, the samples coated with Al2O3–40TiO2 exhibited the lowest corrosion rate. In terms of wear performance, both coated samples displayed similar behavior under different loads. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed the distinctive microstructure of the HVOF-sprayed samples before and after corrosion and wear testing.","Zavareh, Mitra Akhtari;Sarhan, Ahmed Aly Diaa Mohammed;Zavareh, Parisa Akhtari;Razak, Bushroa Binti Abd;Basirun, Wan Jeffrey;Ismail, Mokhtar B.

Influences of infiltrated resin on properties of printed electrodes on non-sintered ceramic films,"Ceramic–resin hybrid substrate-based printed capacitors are fabricated for next generation ceramic packaging. The resin solution is infiltrated into the non-sintered ceramic powder beds by either inkjet printing or spin-coating. The amount of infiltrated resin and its spatial distribution throughout the films critically influence the dielectric loss factor, the adhesion strength, and the electrical conductivity of the electrodes. Although inkjet printing leads to non-uniform distribution of the resin, spin-coating is an effective means to uniformly infiltrate the resin solution. The resulting non-sintering ceramic–resin hybrid substrate-based printed capacitors demonstrate optimal properties comparable to their state-of-the-art low-temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) counterparts.","Kim, Youngwoo;Woo, Kyoohee;Kim, Jihoon;Moon, Jooho",2013-07-31,Ceramics International,"Ceramic–resin hybrid film,Film adhesion,Resin infiltration,Resistivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.11.092,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.11.092
Time-resolved photoluminescence studies in Eu-doped SiO2 – HfO2 – ZnO glass-ceramic waveguides,"Fabrication of ZnO-HfO2 hybrid nanocrystals embedded 70 SiO2-(30−x) HfO2-xZnO (x=0, 2, 5, 7 and 10mol%) ternary glass-ceramic planar waveguides doped with 1mol% Eu-ions, by sol-gel process and dip-coating technique has been reported. The effect of varying ZnO concentration on the growth and structural evolution of ZnO-HfO2 hybrid nanocrystals were investigated using transmission electron microscopy and other spectroscopic tools. Time-resolved PL measurements were performed to estimate the PL emission lifetimes of Eu2+ and Eu3+, present in two different local environments in the ternary matrix, as a function of ZnO concentration. Eu3+ ions exhibit double exponential decay profile for the D 0 5 → F 2 7 emission, while the decay curves of Eu2+ ions are single exponential. The variations in the PL emission decay profiles are used as a probe to investigate the changes in the local environments of the rare-earth ions in the glass-ceramic waveguides.","Ghosh, Subhabrata;Valligatla, Sreeramulu;Lukowiak, Anna;Chiasera, Alessandro;Ferrari, Maurizio;Shivakiran Bhaktha, B.N.",2017-01-31,Ceramics International,"Glass-ceramics,Waveguides,Rare earth,Time resolved PL",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.055,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.055
Oxidation resistance of NITE-SiC/SiC composites with/without CVD-SiC environmental barrier coating,"In this study, the oxidation resistance of nuclear grade graphite (IG-430U) and NITE-SiC/SiC composites with/without CVD-SiC outer coating were evaluated at various temperatures (400–1000 °C) under high oxygen contents (O2 1% and O2 21%). The effect of CVD-SiC outer coating on the oxidation of NITE-SiC/SiC composite was also investigated in the atmosphere of partial oxygen. The weight change of NITE-SiC/SiC composites was mainly dominated by the active oxidation at the interphase of PyC. The weight change speed of these materials significantly decreased with increasing the oxidation time. The oxygen concentration was not sensitive for the oxidation behavior of NITE-SiC/SiC composites, because these materials were affected by oxygen supply rate and CO2 gas evaporation rate through fine channels between fiber and matrix. The PyC interphase of NITE-SiC/SiC composites with a CVD-SiC outer coating remained after the oxidation test. It could be confirmed that the CVD-SiC environmental coating on the surface of NITE-SiC/SiC was very effective for the suppression of oxidation weight loss.","Park, Joon-Soo;Kim, Jong-Il;Nakazato, Naofumi;Kishimoto, Hirotatsu;Makimura, Shunsuke",2018-10-01,Ceramics International,"SiC/SiC composites,NITE process,Oxidation,Environmental barrier coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.194,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.194
Effect of the powder particle structure and substrate hardness during vacuum cold spraying of Al2O3,"In this paper, the effect of the powder particle structure and substrate hardness during vacuum cold spraying (VCS) of Al2O3 is investigated. Our results help understand the underlying deposition mechanism during VCS in more detail and enable the tailoring and improving of the resulting coatings. Two structurally different alumina feedstocks were used for this study. We find that the loosely agglomerated powder bonds to the substrate primarily through coordinated deformation of the nano-sized powder particles. The sintered powder, on the other hand, bonds to the substrate through severe fracture and deformation of the particles. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) was employed to observe details in the interfacial microstructure of the coatings on the two substrates with differing hardness. The hard steel substrate facilitates particle fracture, which leads to cohesive particle/particle-bonding in the coating region close to the substrate. The softer aluminum substrate leads to strong interfacial coating/substrate-bonding because the particles are embedded into the substrate. In summary, the fracture and deformation of the feedstock as well as the substrate hardness affect both adhesion (coating/substrate bonding) and cohesion (particle/particle bonding) considerably.","Wang, Li-Shuang;Zhou, Heng-Fu;Zhang, Ke-Jie;Wang, Yu-Yue;Li, Cheng-Xin;Luo, Xiao-Tao;Yang, Guan-Jun;Li, Chang-Jiu",2017-04-01,Ceramics International,"Vacuum cold spray,Alumina coating,Powder particle structure,Substrate hardness",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.085,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.085
Microstructure formed by suspension plasma spraying: From YSZ splat to coating,"In the current work, by means of suspension plasma spraying (SPS), yttria stabilized zirconia splats and coatings were deposited onto mirror-polished and rough substrates, respectively. The splats were characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopes (TEM). The influence of substrate temperature on splat morphology was analyzed via comparing the splats deposited onto substrates held at different temperatures, namely room temperature (RT), 300°C, 500°C, 700°C and 900°C. As the substrates were heated from RT to 300°C, the feature of splats changed rapidly. However, when the substrate temperature further increased, the variation of morphology was found less conspicuous. Integrated splats were peeled off from the substrate using a “plating and etching” approach for TEM examination. The observation on morphological and crystallographic features of splats revealed that the cooling rate during impacting and spreading of SPS splats was lower than that of splats deposited by conventional atmospheric plasma spraying. Based on the characteristics of splats, a modified mechanism consisting changing of droplets trajectory and shadowing effect was proposed to explain the formation of the microstructure of as-sprayed SPS coating. In addition, the coatings were also examined by X-ray diffraction and nano-indenter to determine the phase composition and microhardness, respectively.","Li, Dachuan;Feng, Jingwei;Zhao, Huayu;Liu, Chenguang;Zhang, Linlin;Shao, Fang;Zhao, Yuexing;Tao, Shunyan",2017-07-31,Ceramics International,"Suspension plasma spraying,Yttria stabilized zirconia,Splat,Microstructure,Transmission electron microscope",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.027,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.027
Facile fabrication of SiO2 nanotubes coated with nitrogen-doped carbon layers as high-performance anodes for lithium-ion batteries,"Silica-based anodes have attracted considerable attention because of their low discharge potential and high theoretical specific capacity. Herein, SiO2 nanotubes (SNTs) were prepared via the sol-gel method with an ammonium dl-tartrate template, followed by the coating of N-doped carbon layers on their surface through a simple dopamine self-polymerization. The unique hollow tubular structure can accommodate large volume expansions. Notably, N-doped carbon layers play a crucial role in enhancing the SiO2 conductivity and increasing the Li+ diffusion rate. Furthermore, SNTs with high specific surface areas provide numerous sites for electron and Li+ insertion during lithiation. Hence, under the combined effect of the above-mentioned properties, N-doped carbon-coated SNTs (SNTs@NC) composites exhibited excellent cycling and rate performances. At a current density of 100 mA g−1, SNTs@NC composites delivered a reversible specific capacity of 781 mA h g−1 after the 200th cycle. Even at 1 A g−1, the composites achieved a value of 522 mA h g−1. With such excellent electrochemical properties, SNTs@NC composite material can serve as the next-generation anode for lithium-ion batteries.","Zhang, Xi;Li, Ke;Li, Yanbo;Liu, Jinjie;Dai, Jintao;Li, Yifan;Ai, Fanrong",2020-09-02,Ceramics International,"SiO2 nanotubes,N-doped carbon layers,Anode,Lithium-ion batteries",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.260,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.260
Carbofilm ™: Present and future applications in biomedical devices,"Carbofilm is a thin film of pyrolytic carbon that can be deposited on materials, such as polymers and metals, suitable for implantable-prosthesis production. In this way, the coated material acquires the well-known biocompatibility characteristics of pyrolytic carbon. In critical applications such as heart-valve prostheses, the Carbofilm coating has proved to be effective in reducing those blood and tissue reactions that can negatively affect the implanted prosthesis functionality. Carbofilm can be applied on different biomedical devices in order to improve their biocompatibility: a summary of experimental results obtained with vascular grafts, plastic-surgery devices, and orthopaedic and maxillofacial prostheses will be reported. In particular, the most recent results concerning the osteocompatibility of titanium-alloy coated and uncoated samples will be presented: Carbofilm-coated cylinders implanted in the cubital bone of sheep, histologically evaluated at three and twelve months, showed a better biological response (lower osteoclastic erosion and connective-tissue formation) than uncoated ones.","Vallana, Franco;Pasquino, Enrico;Rinaldi, Stefano;Galloni, Marco;Gatti, Antonietta Maria;Modica, Fabio;Benech, Arnaldo",1993-12-31,Ceramics International, ,10.1016/0272-8842(93)90038-S,https://doi.org/10.1016/0272-8842(93)90038-S
Surface structural and solar absorptance features of nitrate-based copper-cobalt oxides composite coatings: Experimental studies and molecular dynamic simulation,"The copper and cobalt oxides composites coatings on aluminum substrates have been successfully synthesized via sol-gel method using nitrate-based sol precursors. The composites were characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and UV–Vis–NIR spectrophotometry. The sol-gel reactions were discussed and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation was integrated into the study to predict molecules assembly properties. The XRD analyses revealed that the CuO and the Co3O4 composites were formed after the annealing process with the average difference of the calculated lattice parameters compared to ICDDs was 1.17%. The surface electronic structure was mainly consisted of tetrahedral Cu(I), octahedral Cu(II), tetrahedral Co(II), octahedral Co(III) as well as surface, sub-surface and lattice oxygen O−. The XRD, XPS and MD simulation results showed that there was minimal (or possibly non-existing) indication of copper-cobalt mixed phase oxides formations. FESEM and AFM surveys revealed that the coating had a porous surface composed of interlinked nanoparticles in the range of ~ 10 to ~ 40 nm. UV–Vis–NIR reflectance spectra showed that the sol precursors concentration and the dip-drying cycle significantly influenced the absorptance value with optimum absorptance (α) of 88.7% exhibited by coating synthesized using sol concentration of 0.1 M and 10 dip-drying cycles.

"Morphology, structure and photowettability of TiO2 coatings doped with copper and fluorine","The work reports synthesis, structure and properties of doubly doped titanium dioxide coatings activated by ultraviolet and visible light. Copper within a concentration range of 0.4–3.4at% and fluorine within a concentration range of 1.7–9.4at% were introduced as dopants. The coatings were prepared with the help of radiofrequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition technique with a single precursor compound providing both dopants and titanium (IV) chloride being a source of titanium. Elemental composition and chemical bonding analyses of the coatings were carried out with the help of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results indicate that both admixtures are chemically bound to the TiO2 matrix – a notion confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Phase composition studies, performed with a low angle X-ray diffraction method, revealed a presence of a threshold concentration of the dopants affecting the coatings crystallinity.

In addition, the electrical and infrared reflection properties of the coated trilayers were examined by four-point probe system and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. The results indicated that the Ag inner layer started forming a continuous film at the thickness of 10nm which was supported by XRD result of the distinct 200 and 220 Ag peaks. Besides, the highest average visible transmittance of 80.5% was obtained by the AZO (30nm)/Ag (10nm)/AZO (30nm) structure. Furthermore, the lowest sheet resistivity of 4.36Ω/sq and the highest infrared reflection rate of 96% in FIR region can be obtained by the AZO (30nm)/Ag (13nm)/AZO (30nm) structure.

Fabrication of Ni-W-B4C composite coatings and evaluation of its micro-hardness and corrosion resistance properties,"Boron carbide (B4C) particles were embedded in nickel-tungsten (Ni-W) coatings by pulse current electrodeposition technique. Physical properties of the composite coatings were studied by XRD, SEM, EDS and Vickers micro-hardness instrument. Corrosion protection of the deposited films was investigated utilizing potentiodynamic polarization and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). Results exhibited that the addition of B4C nanoparticles into the Ni-W alloy can significantly improve the surface morphology and the micro-hardness of the composite coatings. The corrosion resistance of Ni-W-B4C nanocomposite is much better than Ni-W alloy deposit, especially when the concentration of B4C nanoparticles is 2 g/L in plating bath, the obtained Ni-W-B4C composite coating has the best surface morphology, the highest micro-hardness and the excellent corrosion resistance.","He, Teng;He, Yi;Li, Han;Su, Zubo;Fan, Yi;He, Ze",2018-06-01,Ceramics International,"Pulse current plating,Ni-W-B4C,Micro-hardness,Corrosion resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.128,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.128
Synthesis and characterization of Sb-doped SnO2 with high near-infrared shielding property for energy-efficient windows by a facile dual-titration co-precipitation method,"Sb-doped SnO2 (ATO) powders were favorably synthesized using a dual-titration co-precipitation method for the application of energy-efficient windows. A dual-titration co-precipitation method can effectively inhibit the aggregation of primary nanoparticles, which is conducive to prepare stable dispersion applied to glazing materials for blocking part of solar radiation. Various annealing temperatures, doping molar ratios and ethanol content of precursor solution were used to investigate the influence on the morphology and phase composition of the as-synthesized ATO powders. The results illustrated that the reasonable reaction conditions to prepare ATO powders with near-infrared shielding property should be: the doping molar ratio of 10%, the content of ethanol in precursor solution of 100% and the annealing temperature of 1000 °C. Besides, ATO primary nanoparticles were gained ranging from 45 to 55 nm with a low aggregated degree. The ATO coating prepared by the ATO dispersion with 20 wt% demonstrated the optimal selective transmitted spectra, which simultaneously achieved the average visible transmittance of 80.15% but average near-infrared transmittance of 23.31%. In addition, a simulated experiment demonstrated that ATO coated glass exhibited a better near-infrared shielding property than ITO (Sn-doped In2O3) coated glass.","Shen, Boxu;Wang, Yuanhao;Lu, Lin;Yang, Hongxing",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"Sb-doped SnO2,Dual-titration co-precipitation,Low aggregated degree,Near-infrared shielding property,Energy-efficient windows",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.157,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.157
Synthesis and properties of ceramic-based nanocomposite layer of aluminum carbide embedded with oriented carbon nanotubes,"In the present work, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were embedded in aluminum carbide coating in desired vertical/horizontal direction in order to fabricate a nanocomposite layer with unidirectional enhanced mechanical properties. A novel method based on monopolar pulsed plasma electrolysis under magnetic field was used for this purpose. Nanostructure of the obtained nanocomposite layer was examined with high precision figure analysis of SEM, AFM and TEM nanostructures. The mechanical and tribological properties of these coatings were investigated with respect to the direction of the embedded CNTs. The coefficient of friction was lowered from 0.2 to less than 0.1 in a pin-on-disc test against steel with dramatic affected coating wear rate by a decrease to near 400% with respect to raw substrate. The lower friction is attributed to more extensive creation of amorphous carbon on the counter surface and also in the coating wear track. As a conclusion, this method is appropriate for fabrication of hard coating on the surface of low-melting-point metals and light alloys.","Aliofkhazraei, M.;Yousefi, Mohammad;Ahangarani, Sh.;Rouhaghdam, A.

Improved ferroelectric properties in KBiFe2O5-polymer composite film,"Composite films of KBiFe2O5 and PVA were prepared with a varied weight percentage of PVA by spin coating method on platinised silicon wafer. The composite films were characterised for dielectric and ferroelectric properties in comparison to pure KBiFe2O5thick film. The frequency dependent permittivity measurement indicated a higher contribution of space charge/interfacial polarization in KBiFe2O5 thick film than that in the KBiFe2O5 -PVA composite films. The ferroelectric properties in composite films were enhanced due to the reduction in leakage current and they showed well saturated polarization hysteresis loops. The remanent polarization value in KBiFe2O5 -PVA composite film (Pr = 3.7 μC/cm2) was found to be 2.5 times higher than that of the pure KBiFe2O5 film (Pr = 1.45 μC/cm2) and with the increase in PVA percentage, the remanent polarization values also increased. The space charge dominated conduction in pure KBiFe2O5 became transformed to field assisted ionic conduction in the KBiFe2O5 composite films. The polymeric matrix in KBiFe2O5 composites helped in reducing the leakage current of pure KBiFe2O5 by four orders of magnitude and further reduced with the increase in the PVA content in the composite. The composite films showed fatigue free polarization even after 108 switching cycles whereas the polarization degradation in KBiFe2O5 film was 30% around 108switching cycles.","Jalaja, M.A.;Dutta, Soma",2019-06-01,Ceramics International,"KBiFe2O5,PVA,Dielectric,Ferroelectric,Leakage,Fatigue",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.049,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.049
Effect of Fe doping on TiO2 films prepared by spin coating,"Iron-doped titanium dioxide thin films were coated on fluorine-doped tin oxide coated glass using the spin coating technique. The concentration of the dopant was varied up to 7mol% iron (metal base). The films were characterised for their structural, morphological, and optical properties. Glancing angle X-ray diffraction and laser Raman microspectroscopy indicate that the films consisted solely of the anatase polymorph of titanium dioxide, without any contamination phases, such as iron oxide. Field emission scanning electron microscopy indicates that the films were microstructurally homogeneous and fully dense, with grains in the size range of ∼10–20nm. UV-VIS spectrophotometry shows that the optical indirect band gap of the films decreased with increasing iron doping (3.36eV for undoped and 2.95eV for 7mol% Fe).","Lin, C.Y.W.;Channei, D.;Koshy, P.;Nakaruk, A.;Sorrell, C.C.",2012-07-31,Ceramics International,"Titanium dioxide,Fe doping,Spin coating,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.01.047,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.01.047
Fabrication and characterization of Zn x Cd1−x S nanoparticles in chitosan alginate nanocomposite films,"Zn x Cd1−x S nanoparticles were formed in chitosan alginate nanocomposite films using spin-coating technique. Crystal structure and size, optical properties and surface morphology were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis), photoluminescence (PL) spectra, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), respectively.

With increasing Zn/Cd molar ratio, the UV–vis absorption peaks shift to low-wavelength side with a slight intensity decrease. The relative emission intensity of the film may be changed regularly by variation of the Zn x Cd1−x S nanoparticles composition. Surface morphology of the films containing Zn x Cd1−x S nanoparticles changes with various Zn/Cd molar ratios. The film morphology goes from rough to smooth with increasing Zn/Cd, and the phase goes from bump-like shape to particle-like shape with a more uniform distribution due to the radius difference between Zn and Cd ions.","Wang, Liping;Sun, Yujie;Yang, Xiaofei",2014-04-30,Ceramics International,"Zn x Cd1−x S nanoparticles,Nanocomposite films,Chitosan,Surface morphology",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.09.036,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.09.036

"YBO3: Ce3+, Yb3+ based near-infrared quantum cutting phosphors: Synthesis and application to solar cells","Ce3+ and Yb3+ co-doped YBO3 phosphors were facilely fabricated by a hydrothermal method. The investigations reveal that hexagonal YBO3: Ce3+, Yb3+ nanoparticles aggregate to form cyclic structure after annealing at 900°C. An efficient near-infrared (NIR) quantum cutting phenomenon involving the emission of two NIR photons (971nm) for each ultraviolet (UV) photon (360nm) absorbed is observed based on the cooperative energy transfer (CET) from Ce3+ to Yb3+ in YBO3 with a CET efficiency of 41.9%. Moreover, YBO3: Ce3+, Yb3+/SiO2 films with anti-reflection and NIR quantum cutting abilities were prepared by dip-coating method. The as prepared composite films can convert UV photons into NIR photons between 950nm and 1050nm, which well matched with the spectral response of the silicon-based solar cell. The experimental results indicate that the photoelectric conversion efficiency of silicon solar cell can be effectively improved by assembling the YBO3: Ce3+, Yb3+/SiO2 bi-functional film, and the corresponding conversion efficiency is about 0.521% higher than the pure glass and 0.252% higher than the pure SiO2 anti-reflection (AR) film. In a word, this work provides a simple strategy to develop optical films with AR and NIR quantum cutting abilities for solar energy conversion.","Hao, Yuanyuan;Wang, Yue;Hu, Xiaoyun;Liu, Xixi;Liu, Enzhou;Fan, Jun;Miao, Hui;Sun, Qian",2016-06-30,Ceramics International,"YBO3,Cooperative energy transfer,Solar cells,Anti-reflection,NIR quantum cutting",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.02.158,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.02.158
"Low thermal conductivity Sr2+, Zn2+ and Ti4+ ions co-doped LaMgAl11O19 for potential thermal barrier coating applications","The influences of partial substitution of La3+, Mg2+ and Al3+ by Sr2+, Zn2+ and Ti4+, respectively, in LaMgAl11O19 magnetoplumbite were studied by evaluating the thermal conductivity (κ) and coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) of La1−x Sr x Mg1−x Zn x Al11−x Ti x O19 (LSMZATO) solid solutions up to T=1273K. The X-ray diffraction patterns of LSMZATO (0.0≤x≤0.5) reveal identical magnetoplumbite phase structure. The weakened crystal energy of LSMZATO series results in a maximum value of the CTE at x=0.5. The mechanism behind the lowered thermal conductivity was mainly due to the enhanced phonon scattering by point defects and high-density grain boundary. The lowest κ is ~1.16Wm−1 K−1 at 1073K, which is due to the phonon mean free path being on the inter-atomic level. The excellent thermo-physical properties qualify Sr2++Zn2++Ti4+ co-doped LaMgAl11O19 magnetoplumbite as promising candidate materials for advanced thermal barrier coatings.","Lu, Haoran;Wang, Chang-An;Zhang, Chenguang",2014-12-31,Ceramics International,"Co-doped LaMgAl11O19,Thermal conductivity,Point defects,Phonon scattering,Thermal barrier coatings",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.07.064,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.07.064
Microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of atmospheric plasma sprayed Y2O3 coating with state of in-flight particle,"Y2O3 coating on Al2O3 substrate was prepared by atmospheric plasma spray (APS). Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was carried out to predict the state of in-flight Y2O3 particles at different powder feeding rates. Microstructure and mechanical properties were found to be affected by the spray distance and powder feeding rate. In this study, the hardness was calculated using a field emission-scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) because the indentation in the coating is too small to measure using a hardness test machine. The formation of pores causes a decrease in the mechanical property, and the pore length of over 10 μm substantially decreases the hardness. Meanwhile, the solidification behavior is affected by the maximum temperature of the in-flight particles. Based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis, the maximum temperature of the in-flight particles was found to decrease with increase of the powder feeding rate at the same spray distance. At the powder feeding rate of 60 g/min, a lower adhesion strength was confirmed than that at feeding rate of 30 g/min because splats were insufficiently spread due to the lower maximum temperature of the in-flight particles. The roughness and height of the coating surface were evaluated by confocal microscopy and atomic force microscopy(AFM) analyses. The roughness is the resultant of accumulated splats and the accumulation mechanism of splats is affected by the state of the in-flight particles. Furthermore, there were nano-scale differences of height on the splat surface, on which the nucleation looks like ‘rugged bark’ during solidification of splats when the in-flight particles impact the substrate.","Lee, DoSung;Yun, Seokjung;Han, Jang-Woo;Song, MinYoung;Kim, YoungGeun;Lee, JongKweon;Choi, Joonmyung;Chang, Seongmin;Hong, Seungbum;Kim, JaeHwang",2020-09-28,Ceramics International,"Atmospheric plasma spraying,Y2O3,Pore,In-flight particle,Splat morphology",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.246,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.246
Microstructure and oxidation behavior of MoSi2-based coating on carbon/carbon composites,"MoSi2-based oxidation protective coating was fabricated on carbon/carbon (C/C) composites by combining pack cementation and supersonic atmospheric plasma spraying techniques. This work firstly studied the effect of spraying power on the phase composition of MoSi2 coating. Proper power at 50–55 kW could suppress the phase transition and powder oxidation of MoSi2 during spraying, which facilitated the coating densification. In addition, the static oxidation behavior of MoSi2-based coating at 900 °C, 1200 °C and 1500 °C was systematically investigated, and its oxidation resistance at 1500 °C was better than 900 °C and 1200 °C. More specifically, the MoSi2-based coating continued to reduce mass during the oxidation at 900 °C without significant mass addition, and the mass loss rate rapidly increased with the promotion of oxidation process, eventually showing a large mass loss percentage. However, it exhibited varying degrees of mass gain during oxidation at 1200 °C and 1500 °C, and the ultima mass loss percentage was relatively low. The mass gain phenomenon is correlated with the produced SiO2 glass scale covering on the coating surface, while the mass loss behavior may be attributed to the immoderate depletion of MoSi2-based coating and the considerable evaporation of gaseous products accompanied by the oxidation reaction ongoing.","Wang, Chang-Cong;Li, Ke-Zhi;He, Dan-Yang;Huo, Cai-Xia;He, Qin-Chuan;Shi, Xiao-Hong",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Composites,MoSi2,Coating,Microstructure,Oxidation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.210,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.210
Preparation and properties of Sb-doped SnO2/metal substrates by sol–gel and dip coating,"Antimony-doped SnO2 on metallic substrate is a useful electrode for electrochemical water treatment system. The Sb-doped SnO2 films on aluminum and stainless steels, which are relatively workable or available metals, were prepared by the sol–gel technique and dip coating method. The precursor metal alkoxide/alcohol solutions were derived from SnCl4 and SbCl3. Ammonia/alcohol solution was used for the synthesis and Cl− was eliminated by the precipitation of NH4Cl. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the SnO2 film annealed at 400°C could be assigned to SnO2. The Sb-SnO2 film consisted of fine particles from 10 to 20nm. In the electrolysis, Sb-SnO2/stainless steel electrodes showed an exfoliation but Sb-SnO2/aluminium did not. Our results indicate that SnO2/Al can be promising as a SnO2 electrode for electrochemical water treatment.","Seo, M.;Akutsu, Y.;Kagemoto, H.",2007-05-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Processing of graded anode-supported micro-tubular SOFCs based on samaria-doped ceria via gel-casting and spray-coating,"A simple gel-casting method was successfully combined with the spray-coating technique to manufacture graded anode-supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells (MT-SOFCs) based on samaria-doped ceria (SDC) as an electrolyte. Micro-tubular anodes were shaped by a gel-casting method based on a new and simple forming technique that operates as a syringe. The aqueous slurry formulation of the NiO–SDC substrate using agarose as a gelling agent, and the effect of spray-coating parameters used to deposit the anode functional layers (AFLs) and electrolyte were investigated. Furthermore, pre-sintering temperature of anode substrates was systematically studied to avoid the anode–electrolyte delamination and obtain a dense electrolyte without cracks, after co-sintering process at 1450°C. Despite the high shrinkage of substrate (∼70%), an anode porosity of ∼37% was achieved. MT-SOFCs with ∼2.5mm of outer diameter, 370μm thick substrate, 20μm thick AFLs and 15μm thick electrolyte were successfully obtained. The use of AFLs with 30:70 and 50:50wt% NiO–SDC allowed to obtain a continuous gradation of composition and porosity in the anode–electrolyte interface.","Morales, M.;Navarro, M.E.;Capdevila, X.G.;Roa, J.J.;Segarra, M.",2012-07-31,Ceramics International,"SOFC,Micro-tubular SOFC,Graded anode,Doped ceria,Gel-casting,Spray-coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.01.015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.01.015
Properties of plasma sprayed yttria stabilized zirconia thermal barrier coating prepared from co-precipitation synthesized powder,"In the present work, plasma sprayable 8wt% YSZ powder has been prepared by the co-precipitation method without using any agglomeration process.

The powders were characterized for phase, particle size, morphology and flowability. The plasma sprayed coatings were characterized for microstructure, porosity, hardness, Young׳s modulus, thermal conductivity and thermal cyclic behavior. Plasma sprayed YSZ coating obtained from the coprecipitation synthesized powders with 15% porosity exhibited a thermal conductivity of 0.75W/mK at 900°C.

Effect of Mn doping on defect-related photoluminescence and nanostructure of dense 3-D nano-root network of ZnO,"In this paper, we investigate the effect of Mn doping on an interesting morphology of ZnO thin films prepared by sol-gel spin coating technique. The tunability of morphology, structural and optical properties by doping has been reported. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples annealed at 400 °C confirm the formation of hexagonal wurtzite ZnO without any Mn related phases. On introduction of Mn in ZnO lattice, the crystallite size decreases. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) studies of the samples confirmed the formation of 3-D nanostructured thin films with morphology similar to a dense network of roots. The nano-root network comprises nanoparticles and as the Mn content is increased, the nanoparticles agglomerate. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy-based color mapping technique was employed to observe the distribution of Zn, Mn, and O elements. On increasing the doping concentration of Mn, there is a blue-shift in the absorption edge in the absorption spectra recorded by UV–Vis spectroscopy. The optical bandgap increases linearly from 3.26 eV to 3.32 eV on increasing the Mn content from 0 at% to 5 at%. Photoluminescence spectroscopy was used to characterize the deep level emissions. A broad deep level emission band arising due to defects was observed which ranges from violet to red region in the undoped ZnO and is significantly suppressed after Mn-doping. Owing to its dense 3-D intertwined nanoroot network, the proposed study is expected to find potential application in gas sensing, photodetection and catalysis.","Rudra, Kamal;Prajapati, Y.K.",2020-06-01,Ceramics International,"Defect photoluminescence,Mn doping,Nanostructures,Oxides,ZnO",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.004
The tribological properties of bioceramic coatings produced on Ti6Al4V alloy by plasma electrolytic oxidation,"In this study, hydroxyapatite and calcium apatite-based bio-ceramic composite coatings were produced on Ti6Al4V alloy by plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) in the electrolyte consisting of calcium acetate (CA) and β-calcium glycerophosphate (β-Ca-GP) for different treatment times. Coating thickness, phase structure, coating morphology of the cross section, elemental composition, adhesion strength, wear resistance and tribological property of the PEO coatings were analyzed by eddy current method, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX mapping), micro scratch tester and tribometer, respectively. The average thickness of the coatings varied from 28 to 52µm with increasing times. The XRD results indicated that anatase (TiO2), rutile (TiO2), TiP2, TCP (Ca3(PO4)2), perovskite – CaTiO3 and hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) phases were formed on the Ti6Al4V alloy after PEO. According to the EDS mapping results, uniform Ca and P elemental distributions were observed on the surface of PEO coatings. The adhesion strengths of the PEO coatings enhanced with increasing time. The wear resistances and tribological properties of the PEO coatings were greater than those of the uncoated Ti6Al4V alloys, and they were increased with increased time.","Durdu, Salih;Usta, Metin",2014-03-31,Ceramics International,"Plasma electrolytic oxidation,Micro arc oxidation,Hydroxyapatite coatings,Titanium alloys,Mechanical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.09.062,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.09.062
Inert substrate-supported microtubular solid oxide fuel cells based on highly porous ceramic by low-temperature co-sintering,"Inert substrate-supported microtubular solid oxide fuel cells (MT-SOFCs) are attractive due to their advantages, including high reduction–oxidation (redox) cycling stability and thermal cycling tolerance. A method involving sequential dip-coating, leaching, and co-sintering was developed and applied to fabricate inert substrate-supported MT-SOFCs through acid leaching nickel from the conventional Ni–yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anode. A thin current collector was deposited onto the support surface to minimize the current collection losses by collecting current from the entire surface area of the anode. A dense electrolyte could be obtained at a co-sintering temperature of 1250 °C. The produced MT-SOFC with the configuration of porous zirconia support/Ni–Scandia-stabilized zirconia (SSZ) anode current collector/Ni-SSZ anode/SSZ electrolyte/strontium-doped lanthanum manganite (LSM)-SSZ cathode/LSM cathode current collector was evaluated by electrochemical characterization tests. The inert substrate-supported MT-SOFC exhibited the maximum power densities of 616, 542, 440, and 300 mW cm−2 at 800, 750, 700, and 650 °C, respectively using dry hydrogen and air. In addition, the thermal cycling stability of the MT-SOFC was evaluated.

Structure of biomimetic apatite grown on hydroxyapatite (HA),"Nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (HA) is the bone mineral phase in vertebrate animals. When bones suffer illness or injuries, natural hydroxyapatite reconstructs and remodels its structure. It has been demonstrated that synthetic hydroxyapatite materials emulate bone properties and enhance bone-bonding ability through a biomimetic apatite coating, obtained when bioactive materials are immersed in a physiological-like media. In this research, the biomimetic apatite structure deposited in three synthetic hydroxyapatites (HAs: HAMS, HAUB, and HAUT), after being immersed in a simulated body fluid (SBF), is studied. The synthetic HAs are obtained by co-precipitation, using three different stirring methods: magnetic stirring (HAMS), ultrasonic bath (HAUB), and ultrasonic tip (HAUT). The synthetic HAs are characterized by X-Ray Diffraction (X-RD), High-Resolution Scanning Electron Microscopy (HR-SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalysis and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) before and after SBF assays. The crystal sizes of synthetic HAs are 12.567 nm, 15.188 nm, and 17.903 nm for HAMS, HAUB, and HAUT, respectively. Additionally, HAs have values between 0.940 and 0.942 nm for a -cell parameter, and values between 0.688 and 0.689 nm for c -cell parameter. After 28 days of immersion in Simulated Body Fluid (SBF), the materials show poor crystalline-fine films of biomimetic apatite covering their surfaces. These biomimetic apatite films have values between 0.946 and 0.969 nm for the a -cell parameter and values between 0.698 and 0.710 nm for the c -cell parameter. Hence, crystallinity, crystal size, and morphology of synthetic HAs are dependent on the stirring method used during the synthesis process, which affects the structural characteristics of the biomimetic apatite layers deposited on the synthetic HAs surfaces.","Vargas-Becerril, N.;Sánchez-Téllez, D.A.;Zarazúa-Villalobos, L.;González-García, D.M.;Álvarez-Pérez, M.A.;de León-Escobedo, C.;Téllez-Jurado, L.",2020-12-15,Ceramics International,"Hydroxyapatite,Stirring method,Crystal structure,Morphology,Crystal size,Simulated body fluid",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.044,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.044
Fracture behavior of TBCs with cooling hole structure under cyclic thermal loadings,"The integrity of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) plays an important role in the performance of turbine blades, nevertheless the effect of cooling hole on fracture of TBCs have been less studied. The present work aimed to study the stress evolution and fracture behavior of TBCs with cooling hole under cyclic thermal loadings. Cyclic thermal tests were conducted and the cracking behavior of TBCs around cooling hole was examined using scanning electron microscope (SEM). TBCs exhibited two types of cracks near the hole edge, i.e. surface crack in the top coat and interfacial crack, which could lead to local TBC spallation and shorten the TBC lifetime. To disclose the fracture mechanism, finite element (FE) analysis was also performed. The computed residual stress values were consistent with those measured by Raman spectroscopy tests. FE simulations indicated that the free-edge effect facilitated interfacial peeling and shear stresses near the cooling hole, and hence promoted the initiation of interfacial crack in TBCs. With the increase of thermal loading cycles, the interfacial crack propagated and then coalesced with the surface cracks in the top coat, leading to the final spallation of TBCs at the cooling hole.","Jiang, Jishen;Wu, Di;Wang, Weizhe;Zhao, Xiaofeng;Ma, Xianfeng;Wang, Biao;Shi, Hui-Ji",2020-02-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating (TBC),Cooling hole,Finite element analysis,Interfacial crack,Thermal cycling",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.084,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.084
High-performance LiTi2(PO4)3@carbon anode using double carbon sources for aqueous lithium ion battery,"In this paper, LiTi2(PO4)3@carbon composite as anode for aqueous lithium ion battery has been successfully synthesized by in-situ carbon coating method using oxalic acid and glucose as double carbon sources. XRD results confirm the rhombohedral NASICON-type LiTi2(PO4)3 structure of the as-prepared composite. The LiTi2(PO4)3@carbon composite using double carbon sources (LTP-OG-10) disperses well, and the coated carbon layer has the appropriate thickness of 3–7nm, which result in proper balance of the good electrical conductivity and the fast kinetics of diffusion of lithium ions. LTP-OG-10 exhibits better electrochemical performance compared with those using oxalic acid (LTP-O) or glucose (LTP-G) single carbon source. LTP-OG-10 anode delivers the discharge capacity of 112.5 mAh g−1, 96.8 mAh g−1, and 54.2 mAh g−1 at 0.2C, 5C and 20C, respectively, much larger than that of LTP-O and LTP-G. Moreover, LTP-OG-10 demonstrated excellent cycling performance, with the capacity retention of 71.1% after 400 cycles at 0.2C, 22.9% higher than that of LTP-G. The good electrochemical properties of LTP-OG-10 is mainly ascribed to the increase of defects, high-quality and appropriate thickness of carbon layer. Our study reveals that preparing LiTi2(PO4)3@carbon composite using double carbon sources is an efficient approach to enhance its electrochemical properties.","Zhou, Nan;Huang, Shengxiong;Hong, Tao;Luo, Wei;Tian, Yun;Lu, Xiangyang;Zhou, Zhi",2017-08-15,Ceramics International,"Aqueous lithium ion battery,Anode,LiTi2(PO4)3,Composite,Double carbon sources",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.097,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.097
Preparation and characterization of NiAl–TiC–TiB2 intermetallic matrix composite coatings by atmospheric plasma spraying of SHS powders,"NiAl–TiC–TiB2 intermetallic matrix composite coatings with various TiC–TiB2 contents were fabricated by depositing self-propagating high-temperature synthesized (SHS) NiAl–TiC–TiB2 powders using atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) technique. The preparation process was carefully investigated and the effects of TiC–TiB2 contents on the physical and chemical properties of the composite coating were studied. Results indicate that SHS synthesized NiAl–TiC–TiB2 intermetallic matrix materials show high purity. The TiC–TiB2 particles are well dispersed in the NiAl matrix. There is no obvious oxidation in the composite coating during the APS process. With an increase in TiC–TiB2 contents, the hardness of NiAl–TiC–TiB2 composite coating is increased, while the thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of the coating is decreased. NiAl–TiC–TiB2 intermetallic matrix composite coating with moderate TiC–TiB2 content shows the best corrosion resistance. Few TiC–TiB2 particles in NiAl promote the formation of the continuous Al2O3 film without destroying the integrity of the film improving the corrosion resistance of the coating.","Fan, Xizhi;Huang, Wenzhi;Zhou, Xin;Zou, Binglin",2020-06-01,Ceramics International,"SHS,NiAl,TiC–TiB2,Intermetallic matrix composite,Plasma spraying",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.052,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.052
"Structure, thermal properties and hot corrosion behaviors of Gd2Hf2O7 as a potential thermal barrier coating material","In this work, Gd2Hf2O7 ceramics were synthesized and investigated as a potential thermal barrier coating (TBC) material. The phase composition, microstructure and associated thermal properties of Gd2Hf2O7 ceramics were characterized systematically. Results show that the thermal conductivity of Gd2Hf2O7 ceramics is 1.40 Wm−1K−1 at 1200 °C, ~25% lower than that of 8 wt% yttria partially stabilized zirconia (8YSZ). Gd2Hf2O7 ceramics also present large thermal expansion coefficients, which decrease from 12.0 × 10−6 K−1 to 11.3 × 10−6 K−1 (300–1200 °C). Besides, the hot corrosion behaviors of Gd2Hf2O7 ceramics exposed to V2O5 and Na2SO4 + V2O5 salts at temperatures of 900–1200 °C were discussed in great detail.

Development of a durability evaluation model to optimize rare-earth-element-based thermal barrier coatings,"A reliable technique for evaluating the durability of the double-ceramic-layered thermal barrier coatings will enhance the design process by increasing efficiency and lowering costs. In this study, a failure index was proposed, and a numerical model to evaluate the durability of the coating system was developed. The failure index is a factor that indirectly expresses durability by considering fracture toughness, thermal stress, and the specifications of the system. This approach was used in extensive parametric studies on the top coating material and the thickness ratio of coating systems exposed to temperatures in the range of 1200–1500 °C . For the reliability of the study, La2Zr2O7, La2Ce2O7, LaTi2Al9O10, and Sr(Zr0.8Yb0.1)O2.95 were considered as the material for top-coats. In addition, the heating/cooling condition was carefully determined to reflect an actual engine condition. The minimum thickness, the average shielding performance of the materials, and the failure indexes were calculated in this parametric study. The La2Ce2O7-based system and LaTi2Al9O10-based system were found to be the most effective insulation system and the most durable system, respectively. Finally, experimental studies on four kinds of materials were collected from the references. From the collected data, the failure index of each case was calculated and compared with the actual lifetime. As a result, we have confirmed that the log-scaled lifetime and failure indexes are in a linear relationship. Using the linear relationships, the failure index from the parametric study was converted to a lifetime, allowing for an intuitive durability comparison. In terms of converted life expectancy, the LaTi2Al9O10-based system was again found to be the most durable. In conclusion, the proposed failure index is a useful factor to express the durability of double-ceramic-layered thermal barrier coatings and its practicality can be enhanced by comparisons with experimental data.","Lim, Jang Gyun;Kim, Moon Ki",2019-10-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Double-ceramic-layered thermal barrier coatings,Rare earth element,Life prediction,Optimization",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.169,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.169

Green synthesis of magnesium oxide nanoflower and its application for the removal of divalent metallic species from synthetic wastewater,"Present manuscript deals with the green synthesis of magnesium oxide nanoflower by using bio-compatible acacia gum. MgO nanoparticles were synthesized by the chemical precipitation method and then treated with two different concentrations (10% and 20%) of acacia gum (AG) to develop flower shaped MgO nanoparticles. Magnesium oxide nanoflower was characterized by various techniques such as XRD, TEM, SEM and atomic force microscopy (AFM). XRD confirms the formation of crystalline MgO. TEM analysis demonstrated that particle size of acacia gum treated MgO nanoparticles was higher in comparison to untreated n-MGO particles which confirm coating of acacia gum on bare n-MgO. AFM also supports the formation of nanosized particles. Synthesized samples were then used as adsorbent material for the abatement of divalent metallic ions viz.

Preparation and performance of MAO coatings obtained on AZ91D Mg alloy under unipolar and bipolar modes in a novel dual electrolyte,"Ceramic coatings were obtained on AZ91D magnesium alloy by microarc oxidation under unipolar and bipolar modes in a silicate–aluminate dual electrolyte. The surface and cross-sectional morphology, coating thickness and phase composition of coatings were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), layer thickness meter and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. The corrosion resistance of coatings in a 3.5% NaCl neutral solution was evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization. The results showed that the microarc oxidation (MAO) process in the unipolar mode was very similar to that in the bipolar mode. The average thickness of the coating obtained in the unipolar mode was thinner than that in the bipolar mode. Both coatings were mainly composed of MgO, Mg2SiO4 and MgAl2O4. Introduction of a cathodic component during the MAO process was helpful to obtain a uniform and compact coating. The electrochemical study indicated that the coating obtained in the bipolar mode was in better corrosion resistance due to its compact microstructure and thickness.","Wang, Shuyan;Xia, Yongping;Liu, Li;Si, Naichao",2014-01-31,Ceramics International,"Magnesium alloy,Microarc oxidation,Unipolar,Dual electrolyte,Corrosion resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.05.108,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.05.108
Mechanical and dielectric properties of short carbon fiber reinforced Al2O3 composites with MgO additive,"A series of short-carbon-fiber/Al2O3 composites with MgO as sintering additive were fabricated by pressureless sintering process. The effects of short carbon fiber (Csf) content on the mechanical, dielectric and microwave absorbing properties of the composite were investigated. The results show that the addition of MgO enhances the density, hardness and the flexural strength of the alumina ceramic. However, these mechanical properties of the Csf/Al2O3–MgO composite decrease with increasing Csf content. Both the real and imaginary parts of the complex permittivity increase with increasing Csf content in the frequency range of 8.2–12.4GHz, which is attributed to the increasing electron polarization and associated polarization relaxation, respectively. When the Csf content is 0.3wt%, the reflection loss less than −10dB and the minimum value of −27dB are obtained with the coating thickness being 1.4mm. The results indicate that the Csf/Al2O3 with MgO is an excellent candidate for microwave absorbing material with favorable mechanical property.","Huang, Shanshan;Zhou, Wancheng;Luo, Fa;Wei, Ping;Zhu, Dongmei",2014-03-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Microstructure stabilization of a novel glass/YSZ composite coating material by adding alumina particles,"Glass-based composite coating materials incorporating particles of alumina or YSZ were prepared by reaction sintering. It was revealed that phase evolution played a key role on thermal expansion behavior of the composite coating materials. Both precipitating of t-ZrO2 crystals and adding YSZ inclusions could raise CTEs of the glass-based matrix, while the formation of zircon produced the reverse effect. Especially, alumina additives retarded the crystallization of the base glass and reduced reaction rates between YSZ and the glass matrix remarkably. Thus, the Al2O3/YSZ/glass tri-composites could serve as an environmental barrier coating for intermetallics and superalloys because of the stabilized microstructure.","Wang, Xin;Shen, Mingli;Chen, Minghui;Zhu, Shenglong;Wang, Fuhui",2015-09-30,Ceramics International,"A: Sintering,B: Composites,C: Thermal expansion,D: Glass",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.04.047,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.04.047
Processing of alumina-coated clay–diatomite composite membranes for oily wastewater treatment,"Crack-free alumina-coated clay–diatomite composite membranes were successfully prepared by a simple pressing and dip-coating route using inexpensive raw materials at a temperature as low as 1000°C in air. The changes of porosity, flexural strength, pore size, flux, and oil rejection rate of the membranes were investigated while changing the diatomite content. A simple burn-out process subjected to the used membranes in air completely recovered the specific surface area, steady state flux, and oil rejection rate of the virgin membranes. The recycled membranes showed an exceptionally high oil rejection rate (99.9%) with a feed oil concentration of 600mg/L at an applied pressure of 101kPa. The typical porosity, pore size, flexural strength, oil rejection rate, and steady state flux of the recycled alumina-coated clay–diatomite composite membrane were 36.5%, 0.12μm, 32MPa, 99.9%, and 6.91×10−6 m3 m−2 s−1, respectively, at an applied pressure of 101kPa.","Yeom, Hee-Jong;Kim, Su Chang;Kim, Young-Wook;Song, In-Hyuck",2016-03-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Precision superabrasive grinding of plasma sprayed ceramic coatings,"In this investigation, a set of plasma sprayed ceramic oxide coatings were surface ground using super abrasive wheel. The surface integrity and grindability aspects of the coated surface were studied. During the grinding process, low grinding forces and specific grinding energy were observed and these observations pointed toward micro brittle fracture to be the predominant material removal mechanism in all cases. SEM and FIB milling of the ground samples also revealed that material removal is primarily owing to micro-fracture rather than micro-cutting. This is also corroborated by short broken chip formation during grinding. Further, the nature of the chips did not vary with change in grinding parameters. The surface topography showed signatures of micro-fracture, plowing and rubbing only. The ground surface harbors residual stress. However, this stress, unlike metals, does not have a thermal origin. This is attributed to retention of material properties by the ceramic coatings at the grinding temperature.","Kar, Simanchal;Bandyopadhyay, P.P.;Paul, S.",2016-12-31,Ceramics International,"Plasma spray,Ceramic oxide,Super abrasive,Grinding chips,Residual stress,Critical depth",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.09.100,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.09.100
High-temperature corrosion behavior of zirconia ceramic in molten Na2SO4+NaVO3 salt mixture,"Degradation due to molten salt attack is one of the failure mechanisms of thermal barrier coatings. Thermochemical attack of the salt mixture Na2SO4–30mol% NaVO3 on ZrO2–8mol% YO1.5 (8YSZ) at 1100°C for different times was investigated. In the present study, 8YSZ powder was synthesized using co-precipitation route. The graded morphologies and phase compositions were examined using SEM, XRD and Raman before and after hot corrosion test. The results obtained from XRD have shown that m-ZrO2 and YVO4 were the main corrosion products after hot corrosion test at 1100°C. The results obtained from SEM and EDS observations have shown that large polyhedron crystals of m-ZrO2 and rod-like crystals of YVO4 formed as hot corrosion products after hot corrosion test for 6h and 24h. The phase transformation and chemical interaction are the primary corrosion mechanisms for degradation of 8YSZ ceramic.","Hui, Yu;Zhao, Sumei;Xu, Jiaying;Zou, Binglin;Wang, Ying;Cai, Xiaolong;Zhu, Ling;Cao, Xueqiang",2016-01-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Effect of cellulose buffer layer on synthesis and gas permeation properties of NaA zeolite membrane,"NaA zeolite membrane coating was successfully synthesized on a porous alumina substrate by hydrothermal treatment. The effects of synthesis parameters like, seeding type (ex situ, in situ), time, temperature, sol concentration, coating stages, application of intermediate layer, etc. on membrane characteristics were investigated. A continuous membrane was formed on a seeded substrate. Surface seeding (ex situ crystallization) not only accelerates the zeolite crystallization process on the support surface, but can also enhance the formation of homogeneous NaA zeolite layer. The NaA zeolite membrane with a synthesis time of 4h shows the best microstructure and the quality of membrane was improved by employing the multi-stage coating. But the main problem associated with membrane synthesis was crack formation, and it can be reduced by applying intermediate layer, between support surface and seed layer. A thin cellulose layer was applied to the support surface before applying seed crystals. The performance of the membranes was evaluated by gas permeation measurement. The permeance of O2, N2 decreased as kinetic diameter of gases increased. The permselectivity of O2/N2 was 1.9–2.34. This value showed the molecular sieving effect of NaA zeolite membrane.","Das, Nandini",2010-05-31,Ceramics International,"A. Films,A. Grain growth,B. Microstructure-final,E.

Fe doping effect of vanadium oxide films for enhanced switching electrochromic performances,"In the present study, Fe-doped V2O5 films showing impressive electrochromic (EC) performance were developed using the sol-gel spin-coating method. To confirm the optimized Fe-doping effect on the V2O5 films for the EC performance, we adjusted the Fe atomic percentages to 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 at%, respectively. With the effect of Fe doping on the V2O5 films, the obtained films resulted in the formation of the oxygen vacancies. As the result, when the optimum Fe atomic percentage was 1.0 at%, the enhanced switching speeds (3.7 s for the bleaching speed and 2.0 s for the coloration speed) and enhanced coloration efficiency value (47.3 cm2/C) compared to the other films were implemented. This can be attributed to the improved electrical conductivity and Li+ diffusion coefficient that led to efficient generation of the EC reaction activity and narrowing the optical bandgap at the coloration state to increase transmittance modulation. Therefore, this unique film can be a promising EC material to improve the performance for the EC devices.","Bae, Ju-Won;Koo, Bon-Ryul;Ahn, Hyo-Jin",2019-04-15,Ceramics International,"Films,Electrical properties,Optical properties,Transition metal oxides,Electrochromic performances",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.219,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.219
Preparation of SiC@Al2O3–Y2O3 core-shell nanoparticles by a slow precipitation method for dense SiC sintering,"High sintering temperatures and high pressures are often needed for the densification of SiC. The sintering of SiC can be facilitated by adding Al2O3–Y2O3 oxides as the sintering additives. In the present study, the SiC@Al2O3–Y2O3 composite nanoparticles with a core-shell structure were designed and prepared using a slow co-precipitation method in the presence of urea. It was found that by slowing down the hydrolysis rate of the metal ions, Al(OH)3 and Y(OH)3 could be co-precipitated and uniformly coated on the surface of the SiC nanoparticles by a heterogeneous nucleation mechanism. After subsequent heat treatment, SiC@Al2O3–Y2O3 nanoparticles with amorphous Al2O3–Y2O3 layers of 2–3 nm were obtained. SiC ceramics with different oxides aids were prepared by sintering the core-shell nanoparticles at 1800–1900 °C under a pressure of 30 MPa. For SiC with higher additives of 20 wt%, evident volatilization of the oxide aids occurred at high temperatures with the segregation of the oxides. For the sample sintered at 1800 °C, dense SiC ceramics with uniform sintering aids distribution were obtained with the Al2O3–Y2O3 content as low as 5 wt% and a surface Vickers hardness of 31.5 GPa was obtained.","Liu, Yiteng;Chen, Zhao;Liu, Rongzheng;Zhao, Jian;Liu, Malin",2020-10-15,Ceramics International,"SiC ceramics,Sintering aids,Core-shell nanoparticles,Wet-chemical coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.237,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.237
Preparation and thermophysical properties of Sm2YbTaO7 and Sm2YTaO7,"Sm2YbTaO7 and Sm2YTaO7 ceramics were synthesized by solid reaction method at 1600°C for 10h. Crystal phases have been identified by X-ray diffraction, and their thermal conductivities and thermal expansion coefficients were measured using a laser flash method and the pushing-rod technology, respectively. Results indicate that Sm2YbTaO7 and Sm2YTaO7 exhibit a typical defect fluorite-type crystal structure. Compared to Sm2YTaO7, Sm2YbTaO7 has lower thermal conductivity due to the higher atomic weight difference between the substituted and substituting atoms. The thermal expansion coefficient of Sm2YbTaO7 is greater than that of Sm2YTaO7 due to its elongated average interionic distance. Their thermal conductivities are much lower than that of YSZ, and their thermal expansion coefficients are very close to that of YSZ. The synthesized ceramics also exhibit excellent phase stability in the temperature range from ambient to 1200°C.","Hong-song, Zhang;Hai-peng, Yu;Xiao-ge, Chen;Yong-de, Zhao;Hui-bin, Jiao;Gang, Li;Zhenjun, Li",2016-10-31,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Oxide,Thermal conductivity,Thermal expansion coefficient",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.094,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.094
Effect of hydraulic pressure on alumina coating on pore characteristics of flat-sheet ceramic membrane,"Porous ceramic membranes have been widely studied recently owing to their outstanding thermal and chemical stability. In this paper, we investigate the preparation of an alumina coating over a diatomite-kaolin composite support layer in order to reliably tailor the porous coating structure and avoid defects, such as cracks. In particular, the effect of hydraulic pressure on the alumina coating was investigated using a flat-sheet membrane support. A flat-sheet diatomite-kaolin composite support filter was manufactured by an extrusion process. The characteristics of the membrane pores in an alumina coating on the diatomite-kaolin composite support layer were studied using scanning with electron microscopy, mercury porosimetry, and capillary flow porometer.","Song, In-Hyuck;Bae, Byung-Seo;Ha, Jang-Hoon;Lee, Jongman",2017-09-30,Ceramics International,"Ceramic membrane,Coating,Diatomite,Alumina,Water permeability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.098,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.098
Hydrophobicity and transparency of Al2O3-based poly-tetra-fluoro-ethylene composite thin films using aerosol deposition,"Alumina and polytetrafluoroethylene (Al2O3-PTFE) composite films were fabricated by a simple aerosol deposition (AD) process, to confirm its applicability for various display screens requiring water resistant, anti-smudge and easy-to-clean properties. The surface morphologies, hydrophobic properties, and transparencies of the composite films with different PTFE contents, varying from 0.01 to 1 wt% were investigated. As a result, the composite films with over 0.3 wt% PTFE showed a sudden rise in surface roughness and low transmittance, despite having the highest contact angle of 128° at a PTFE content of 0.3 wt%. From the energy dispersive spectrometer analysis, the crash-cushioning effect of PTFE and agglomerated PTFE particles were determined to be major causes of surface roughness and opacity. In contrast, the transmittance showed a tendency to be enhanced, with an increasing PTFE content in the range of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1 wt% PTFE, respectively. Especially, the film with 0.1 wt% of PTFE had contact angle of 111° and exhibited a high transmittance of over 75%, which was inferred to be an appropriate amount of PTFE, with a high elongation filling up the surface and the internal defects, leading to an enhancement of transparency. Consequently, these results implied that the AD-prepared Al2O3-PTFE composite coatings are promising candidates for various display applications.","Cho, Myung-Yeon;Park, Sung-Joon;Kim, So-Mang;Lee, Dong-Won;Kim, Hong-Ki;Koo, Sang-Mo;Moon, Kyoung-Sook;Oh, Jong-Min",2018-10-01,Ceramics International,"Aerosol deposition,Composite film,Al2O3,PTFE,Hydrophobicity,Transmittance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.076,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.076
Novel carbon coated core-shell heterostructure NiCo2O4@NiO grown on carbon cloth as flexible lithium-ion battery anodes,"Binding-free NiCo2O4@NiO@C/cc electrode was prepared by hydrothermal method, annealing method and physical vapor deposition. In this composite, NiCo2O4@NiO was strongly grown on carbon cloth and formed a core-shell heterostructure, which can facilitate the transport of ions. What's more, the conductivity was dramatically improved after coating NiO nanofalkes. Additionally, carbon coating can inhibit volume expansion, improve material conductivity and structural stability. The free-standing electrode material showed an initial capacity of 1885 mAh g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1, after 100 cycles, the reversible capacity stabilized around 1051 mAh g−1 with Coulomb efficiency of 99.9%. At a high rate of 1600 mA g−1, the capacity exhibited about 721 mAh g−1, indicating that the NiCo2O4@NiO@C/cc composite is an outstanding material as the anode electrode material for flexible lithium-ion batteries with broad application prospect.","Zhu, Yade;Huang, Ying;Wang, Mingyue;Wang, Ke;Yu, Meng;Chen, Xuefang;Zhang, Zheng",2018-12-01,Ceramics International,"Flexible,NiCo2O4@NiO@C/cc electrode material,Electrochemical performance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.257,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.257
Preparation and characterization of hydroxyapatite–forsterite–bioactive glass nanocomposite coatings for biomedical applications,"In order to improve biological and mechanical properties of hydroxyapatite, the concept of hydroxyapatite-included nanocomposite coatings was introduced. By judiciously choosing constituent ceramics for composites preparation, the biological and mechanical performance of coatings can be tailored in order to meet various clinical requirements. The aim of this work was fabrication, development and characterization of novel hydroxyapatite–forsterite–bioactive glass nanocomposite coatings. The sol–gel technique was used to prepare hydroxyapatite–forsterite–bioactive glass nanocomposite in order to apply coating on 316L stainless steel (SS) by dip coating technique. The X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) were used to investigate the phase structure, microstructure and morphology of the coating. In order to evaluate the forsterite incorporation influence upon bioactivity, the changes on the surfaces of the prepared composite coatings after the predicted days of contact with simulated body fluid (SBF) were investigated by SEM. Results showed that the suitable calcined temperature for nanocomposite coatings with different amounts of forsterite was 600°C. At this temperature, the homogenous and crack-free coating could attach to the 316L SS substrate. The crystallite sizes of the prepared coatings were lower than 100nm. The EDX analysis of hydroxyapatite–forsterite–bioglass, coated 316L SS surface, indicated consisting elements of prepared coatings and the substrate. During immersion in the SBF at pre-determined time intervals, apatite layer was formed and stimulation for apatite formation was increased with increase in forsterite amounts. It seems that hydroxyapatite–forsterite–bioactive glass nanocomposite coatings might be good candidates for biomedical applications.","Sebdani, M.

Particle-size-dependent octacalcium phosphate overgrowth on β-tricalcium phosphate substrate in calcium phosphate solution,"The particle size of ceramics affects their performance in both in vitro and in vivo reactions. We evaluated the effects of the particle size of β-tricalcium phosphate (β-Ca3(PO4)2; β-TCP) on octacalcium phosphate (Ca8(HPO4)2(PO4)4·5H2O; OCP) overgrowth on a β-TCP substrate by using two types of β-TCP substrate, one composed of micrometer-sized particles and one composed of nanometer-sized particles (micro-TCP substrate and nano-TCP substrate), under physiological conditions. When the β-TCP substrate was immersed in a simple calcium phosphate solution, it was quickly covered with OCP. The morphology and size of the OCP crystals, as well as the structure, thickness, and crystal density of the overgrown OCP layer, depended on the β-TCP particle size. When the nano-TCP substrate was immersed, string-like (S) precipitates were initially deposited, and then flake-like (F) crystals formed on them. Plate-like (PL) OCP crystals grew on the flake-like crystals, and a three-layer structure (S-layer/F-layer/PL-layer) was formed, while no such structure was observed on the micro-TCP substrate. Small amounts of tiny OCP crystals and HAp-nanofibers precipitated in the micro-TCP substrate, whereas only HAp-nanofibers were observed in the nano-TCP substrate. These findings will facilitate the structural design of OCP-coating layers on a β-TCP scaffold.","Iijima, Mayumi;Onuma, Kazuo",2018-02-01,Ceramics International,"Octacalcium phosphate,β-tricalcium phosphate,Hydroxyapatite,Coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.167,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.167
Ni-doped BaTi5O11: New brilliant yellow pigment with high NIR reflectance as solar reflective fillers,"New brilliant yellow pigments of Ni-doped BaTi5O11 were synthesized via solid-state method. Pure monoclinic BaTi5O11 powders with high crystallinity were obtained when the calcination was performed at 1000 °C for 2 h. As-prepared pigments had particle size distribution that ranged from 0.5 to 2 μm Ni2+ and Ni3+ ions coexisted in the lattice of BaTi5O11 host. Ni-doping resulted in reduced energy gap of 2.44 eV for Ni-doped BaTi5O11 from 3.08 eV for undoped BaTi5O11 because of valence band shift. BaTi5O11 pigments with 5% Ni exhibited excellent color performance (L = 95.1, a* = −9.12, b* = 65.12, C* = 65.75, and ho = 97.97) and impressive NIR reflectance of 76.19%.

"Adhesion strength and thermal shock properties of nanostructured 5La3TiYSZ, 8LaYSZ and 8CeYSZ coatings prepared by atmospheric plasma spraying","The effects of ceramic dopant species and amount on adhesive strength and thermal shock resistance behavior of nanostructured thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) were investigated in detail. Firstly, nanostructured 5wt% La2O3+3wt% TiO2+92wt% YSZ(5La3TiYSZ), 8wt% La2O3+92wt% YSZ (8LaYSZ) and 8wt% CeO2+92wt% YSZ(8CeYSZ) coatings were prepared using atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) technology under the same technic parameters. Secondly, microstructure, adhesion strength and thermal shock behavior of three kinds of coatings were discussed. The results show that 5La3TiYSZ has the highest adhesion strength and the best thermal shock resistance in three kinds of coatings. The adhesion strength and thermal shock life for nanostructured TBCs heavily depend on ceramic materials. Among dopants nanostructured TiO2, La2O3 and CeO2 oxides, TiO2 can take relatively good effects in YSZ and the reason are also discussed using first principles.","Jin, Lei;Liu, Guifang;Li, Peizhong;Zhou, Haibin;Wang, Chun;Zhou, Guodong",2015-11-30,Ceramics International,"Atmospheric plasma spraying,Nanostructured thermal barrier coatings,Nanostructured oxides doping,Adhesion strength,Thermal shock properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.06.027,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.06.027
Effect of the Ni(NO3)2 additive on the electrophoretic deposition of NiO nanoparticles,"In this work, we report the electrophoretic deposition of NiO nanoparticles on aluminum plates, as well as the effect of the nickel nitrate salt used as additive for coating deposition. First, the Ni(OH)2 nanoparticles were synthesized by a precipitation route with NaOH in a conventional microwave oven. This precursor was submitted to a heat treatment at 300 °C for 3 h in order to obtain the nickel oxide without any secondary phase. The NiO nanoparticles with mean crystallite size of 2.79 nm were dispersed in isopropanol and deposited by an electrophoretic procedure on aluminum substrates with 1 cm of distance and under 10 V of DC voltage for 30 min. XPS analysis of the as-prepared coatings reveals that metallic Ni is produced during the EPD process. Moreover, the presence of Ni(NO3)2 as additive on the electrophoretic procedure leads to changes in the morphological features of the coatings. In this sense, a compact and homogenous coating was formed without the presence of nickel salt, whereas a coating with porous and cavities was obtained with a 0.5 mM concentration of Ni(NO3)2. Moreover, a 1.0 mM concentration of the additive results in a poor coverage of the electrode surface. The porous structure of the coatings in combination with the formation of metallic Ni could be useful for electrochemical applications such as capacitors or electrochromic devices.","Navarro-Aguilar, A.I.;Ruíz-Gómez, M.A.;Rodríguez-González, V.;Obregón, S.;Vázquez, A.",2020-12-15,Ceramics International,"NiO,Electrophoretic deposition,Coatings",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.010
Processing of ZrO2 scaffolds coated by glass–ceramic derived from 45S5 bioglass,"Three dimensional, highly porous, ZrO2 scaffolds coated by glass–ceramic derived from 45S5 bioglass were fabricated. The surface reactivity of 45S5 in aqueous solution was investigated as a function of the immersion time. The influence of the solid loading on the rheological behavior of 45S5 aqueous slips with ammonium polyacrylate (NH4PA) was studied; besides the effect of poly(vinyl)alcohol (PVA) on the relative viscosity was determined. The structure and microstructure of uncoated and coated ZrO2 scaffolds were characterized. The high ionic exchange capability of 45S5 was demonstrated by the pH rise, the significant weight loss and the amorphous calcium phosphate nucleation, upon its immersion in aqueous solution. The addition of PVA did not affect the dispersion properties of the 45S5 powder, which were basically controlled by its negative surface charge. 30wt% 45S5 slips with 4wt% PVA exhibited a yield stress and an adequate viscosity in the low shear rate range, to produce a bioglass coating into the ZrO2 scaffold. The glass-ceramic coating was distributed along the strut surfaces, forming a thin film without altering the porosity and the strut thickness of the original ZrO2 scaffold structure.","Stábile, Franco M.;Albano, María P.;Garrido, Liliana B.;Volzone, Cristina;De Oliveira, Paulo Tambasco;Rosa, Adalberto Luiz",2016-02-15,Ceramics International,"45S5 bioglass,45S5 surface reactivity,Rheological behavior,Glass–ceramic coated ZrO2 scaffold,Scaffold structure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.11.140,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.11.140
Development of tantalum oxide (Ta-O) thin film coating on biomedical Ti-6Al-4V alloy to enhance mechanical properties and biocompatibility,"Ti-6Al-4V is widely used for arthroprostheses, particularly in metal-on-metal (MoM) hip joints. In spite of the suitable wear and corrosion resistance, metallic wear particles and metal ion release occur on a large timescale. In addition, metal ion levels in patients' blood and urine often reportedly increase according to clinical data. Neurological disease, inflammatory response and cell necrosis can potentially develop consequently. The aim of this research is to fabricate a thin, hard film coating on Ti-6Al-4V in order to improve mechanical properties, such as the adhesion strength, surface hardness and surface roughness of Ti-6Al-4V, which should lead to substrate biocompatibility mitigation through reduced debris production, ion release and cytotoxicity. Physical vapor deposition (PVD) magnetron sputtering treatment is applied to obtain an enriched tantalum oxide (Ta-O) thin film coating. In this regard, pure tantalum (Ta) as a biocompatible metal is deposited atop Ti-6Al-4V substrate in the presence of oxygen gas and different parameter conditions, including substrate temperature, argon flow rate, oxygen flow rate and DC power. The results indicate that the surface hardness and surface roughness of the Ta-O coated substrate significantly improve compared to uncoated substrate. The adhesion strength between Ta-O thin film and substrate is examined using a micro scratch tester, and maximum adhesion of 2500mN is achieved.","Rahmati, B.;Sarhan, Ahmed.

Effect of PCL concentration on PCL/CaSiO3 porous composite scaffolds for bone engineering,"Porous polycaprolactone (PCL)-coated calcium silicate (CaSiO3) composite scaffolds were successfully prepared by 3D gel-printing (3DGP) and vacuum impregnation technology in this study. The effect of different PCL concentration on porous CaSiO3 scaffolds prepared by 3DGP technology was studied. The composition and morphological characteristics of PCL/CaSiO3 scaffolds were tested by using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) analysis. PCL coating amount on the scaffolds surface was calculated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Compressive strength was tested by a universal testing machine, and degradability was tested by immersing the scaffolds in a simulated body fluid (SBF). The results show that PCL coating thickness increased from 7.29 μm to 12.2 μm, and the compressive strength of the corresponding composite scaffolds increased from 17.15 MPa to 24.12 MPa following with PCL concentration increasing from 7.5% to 12.5%. When the porous composite scaffolds were immersed in SBF for 28 days, the degradation ratio was 1.06% (CaSiO3), 1.63% (CaSiO3-7.5PCL), 1.81% (CaSiO3-10PCL) and 1.55% (CaSiO3-12.5PCL), respectively. It is obviously that PCL/CaSiO3 composite scaffolds, which are suitable for bone growth in bone repair engineering, are beneficial to improve the mechanical properties and biodegradability of pure CaSiO3 scaffolds.","Shao, Huiping;Yu, Xinding;Lin, Tao;Peng, Jiang;Wang, Aiyuan;Zhang, Zhinan;Zhang, Yumeng;Liu, Shuwen;Zhao, Manjian",2020-06-15,Ceramics International,"PCL coating,Vacuum impregnation,Porous scaffolds,CaSiO3,Biodegradability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.079,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.079
Designed formation of NiO@C@Cu2O hybrid arrays as battery-like electrode with enhanced electrochemical performances,"Here, the core-core-shell architectural hybrid electrodes were successfully fabricated by coating of NiO nanosheets on Cu2O nanorod arrays with the help of carbon layers (NiO@C@Cu2O NAs), which was directly grown on Cu foam as battery-like electrode for supercapacitor. Starting from commercial Cu foam, the whole synthesis process mainly involved sequential solution immersion, a carbonization treatment and hydrothermal reaction, all of which were simple and potentially scalable. This core-core-shell hierarchical architecture can not only shorten ion diffusion path and optimize charge transport, but also enhance contact surface area. In addition, the carbon layer as an intermediate layer can shorten the charge transfer distance and protect the structural stability of Cu2O. Moreover, ultrathin nanosheet-like NiO coated on the C@Cu2O backbones can provide more contact area with the electrolyte, which is beneficial for the improvement of areal specific capacitance. Serving as the supercapacitor electrodes, the resulting NiO@C@Cu2O NAs hybrid electrodes exhibited excellent performance, e.g. high specific capacitances of 2.18Fcm−2, and a superior long-cycle lifetime and high cycling stability (91.5% after 10,000 cycles). Such enhanced NiO@C@Cu2O NAs with core-core-shell hybrid structure are promising battery-like electrode for supercapacitors in future applications.","Lin, Jinghuang;Liu, Yulin;Wang, Yiheng;Jia, Henan;Chen, Shulin;Qi, Junlei;Qu, Chaoqun;Cao, Jian;Fei, Weidong;Feng, Jicai",2017-12-01,Ceramics International,"Pseudocapacitor,NiO,Carbon layer,Cu2O,Nanosheets",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.082,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.082
"Structural, optical and visible light photocatalytic properties of nanocrystalline Nd doped ZnO thin films prepared by spin coating method","Nanostructured Nd doped ZnO thin films were deposited on glass substrate by a sol–gel spin coating technique. The prepared thin films were subjected to structural, morphological, optical, photocatalytic and antibacterial studies. XRD studies confirm that all the prepared films possess hexagonal wurtzite structure. FESEM images revealed the granular morphology of the films without any crack and the crystallite size decreased with Nd doping. UV–visible transmission spectra show that the substitution of Nd in ZnO leads to band gap reduction. The influence of Nd doping on the photocatalytic activity of ZnO for the degradation of methylene blue dye was studied under visible light illumination. The decrease in grain size and light absorption over an extended visible region by Nd ion doping in ZnO film contributed equally to improve the photocatalytic activity. The optical density measurement of the films against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria showed better bactericidal activity at a higher level of Nd doping in ZnO.","Poongodi, Govindan;Kumar, Rangasamy Mohan;Jayavel, Ramasamy",2015-04-30,Ceramics International,"Neodymium doped ZnO,Thin film,Sol–gel spin coating method,Photocatalytic activity,Antibacterial activity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.12.098,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.12.098
Hydroxyapatite coatings on Mg-Ca alloy prepared by Pulsed Laser Deposition: Properties and corrosion resistance in Simulated Body Fluid,"Magnesium (Mg) alloys are very promising biocompatible materials for biodegradable biomedical implants, however, the main problem in using them is their fast degradation in the conditions of human body. In this work, we coated Mg-Ca (calcium) alloy substrate with hydroxyapatite (HA) to improve its resistance to corrosion and to control the in vitro degradation. Pulsed Laser Deposition technique was applied to deposit HA coatings. Their properties were investigated by X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, Vickers microhardness, and Tafel plot electrochemical technique. The substrate temperature was ranged in the interval from room up to 400 °C. According to the obtained results, the recommended substrate temperatures are 200–300 °C, since higher ones lead to the HA decomposition. Furthermore, the HA films deposited at 200 and 300 °C show good corrosion resistance in Simulated Body Fluid. The obtained coatings are promising for a perspective use in biomedical implant applications.","Rau, J.V.;Antoniac, I.;Filipescu, M.;Cotrut, C.;Fosca, M.;Nistor, L.C.;Birjega, R.;Dinescu, M.",2018-10-01,Ceramics International,"Coatings,Hydroxyapatite,Mg-alloy,Pulsed Laser Deposition,Biomedical implants",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.095,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.095
Application of artificial neural networks to predict corrosion behavior of Ni–SiC composite coatings deposited by ultrasonic electrodeposition,"A feed-forward, multilayer perceptron artificial neural network (ANN) model with eight hidden layers and 12 neurons was used to predict the corrosion behavior of Ni–SiC composite coatings deposited by ultrasonic electrodeposition. The effect of process parameters, namely, ultrasonic power, SiC particle concentration, and current density, on the weight losses of Ni–SiC composite coatings was investigated. The grain sizes of Ni and SiC were determined by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning probe microscopy (SPM). Results indicate that ultrasonic power, SiC particle concentration, and current density have significant effects on the weight losses of Ni–SiC composite coatings. The ANN model, which has a mean square error of approximately 3.35%, can effectively predict the corrosion behavior of Ni–SiC composite coatings. The following optimum conditions for depositing Ni–SiC composite coatings were determined on the basis of the lowest weight loss of Ni–SiC deposits: ultrasonic power of 250W, SiC particle concentration of 8g/l, and current density of 4A/dm2. XRD and SPM results demonstrate that the average grain sizes of Ni and SiC in the Ni–SiC composite coating are 90 and 70nm, respectively.","Xu, Youjun;Zhu, Yongyong;Xiao, Guorong;Ma, Chunyang",2014-05-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Effect of modified tabular alumina aggregates on mechanical properties and microstructure of Al2O3–Al–C material,"Al2O3–Al–C material was prepared by tabular alumina aggregates (1–3 mm, 0–1 mm, 0.045 mm), modified tabular alumina aggregates (0.5–3 mm), ultra fine α-Al2O3 powder, aluminum powder, flaky graphite as the raw materials, and thermosetting phenolic resin as binder. The coating strength of the modified tabular alumina aggregates was tested, and the physical properties of the specimens at room and high temperature were examined. The phase composition and microstructure of the specimens were analyzed by XRD and SEM. The results showed that: (1) After mixing and wear experiment, the dropping ratio of the coated Al particles was 2.58%, and the coating strength was fairly good; (2) The coated Al particles reacted with C and N2 in situ generated acicular and fibrous Al4C3 and AlN, enhancing the bonding strength between the aggregates and matrix, improving the hot modulus of rupture (HMOR) of the material. In addition, Al4C3 and AlN have a lower coefficient of thermal expansion and higher thermal conductivity, which can absorb the thermal expansion of the particles, alleviate the thermal stress inside the material, and improve the thermal shock resistance of the material.","Ma, Shihang;Shi, Kai;Xia, Yi",2020-05-31,Ceramics International,"Tabular alumina,Modification aggregates,Al2O3–Al–C refractory,HMOR,Thermal shock resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.249,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.249
Preparation and characterization of Cr2O3–TiO2–Al2O3–V2O5 green pigment,"Green pigments with high near infrared reflectance based on a Cr2O3–TiO2–Al2O3–V2O5 composition have been synthesized. Cr2O3 was used as the host component and mixtures of TiO2, Al2O3 and V2O5 were used as the guest components. TiO2, Al2O3, and V2O5 were mixed into 39 different compositions. The spectral reflectance and the distribution of pigment powder were determined using a spectrophotometer and a scanning electron microscope, respectively. It was found that a pigment powder sample S9 with a Cr2O3–TiO2–Al2O3–V2O5 composition of 80, 4, 14 and 2wt%, respectively, gives a maximum near infrared solar reflectance of 82.8% compared with 49.0% for pure Cr2O3. The dispersion of pigment powders in a ceramic glaze was also studied. The results show that the pigment powder sample S9 is suitable for use as a coating material for ceramic-based roofs.","Thongkanluang, Thadsanee;Kittiauchawal, Treedej;Limsuwan, Pichet",2011-03-31,Ceramics International,"Green pigment,Pigment dispersion,Ceramic glaze,Near-infrared reflectance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2010.09.044,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2010.09.044
Surface graphitization of carbon-doped TiZrN coatings,"Surface graphitization was induced to improve the wear characteristics of carbon-doped TiZrN coatings (C-TiZrN) and was investigated in terms of bonding state. The C-TiZrN were prepared by laser carburization using pulsed laser ablation and were annealed to transform the carbon hybridization state from sp3 to sp2. The amorphous phase of the doped carbon was identified by detecting a mixture of hybrid bonds (sp2 and sp3). The variation of the sp2/sp3 ratio from 2.16 to 5.44 implied the transformation from sp3 to sp2 after heat treatment. The transformation of sp2 bond was confirmed by the shift of the G peak to lower wavenumbers and the fluctuation of the ID/IG ratio, in the Raman spectra. The formation of graphitized atomic layers during the transformation was verified by the presence of a 2D peak at 500 °C. The change in lattice constants from 4.47 to 4.45 displayed the effect of the sp3 to sp2 structural transformation. The friction coefficient of the annealed C-TiZrN (500 °C) in the wear test decreased by 12% owing to the suppression of adhesive wear by the graphitized surface.","Kim, Taewoo;Jo, Seung-Hyun;Lee, Jung Woo;Cho, Hyun;Lee, Heesoo",2019-02-01,Ceramics International,"Carbon-doped TiZrN,Amorphous carbon,Graphitization,Bonding state,Friction coefficient",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.064,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.064
The oxidation behaviour of carbon reinforced glass matrix composites,"Oxidation experiments have been performed on carbon fibre reinforced glass matrix composites as a function of glass composition. The oxidation resistance of the carbon fibres has been shown to be related to the microstructure of the glass and the adherence of the glass to the carbon fibres. Coating of the fibres with a SiC CVD precursor has been shown to improve the oxidation resistance of the fibres. However, post-exposure mechanical characterization has shown an inverse relationship between oxidation resistance and the ability of the composites to exhibit “graceful” failures.","Page, K.L.;Duquette, D.J",1997-12-31,Ceramics International, ,10.1016/S0272-8842(96)00027-2,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0272-8842(96)00027-2
Sintering of electron beam physical vapor deposited thermal barrier coatings under flame shock,"Flame shock treatment of electron beam physical vapor deposited (EB-PVD) thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) was carried out to investigate the degradation of TBCs exposed to a temperature gradient. The flame treatment resulted in temperature gradients both in the surface plane and through the thickness of the TBCs. TBC densification occurred where the flame was centered and resulted in a fine crack network at the surface of the TBC. The TBCs with addition of 0.5wt% alumina were made, in which alumina was used as stress sensors for stress measurements by photoluminescence piezo-spectroscopy (PLPS). This allowed stress measurements to be made through the TBC thickness using a depth sensing method. Such stress measurements help us to better understand the densification of the TBCs.","Chen, Chen;Guo, Hongbo;Gong, Shengkai;Zhao, Xiaofeng;Xiao, Ping",2013-07-31,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Photoluminescence piezo-spectroscopy,Sintering,Flame shock",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.12.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.12.005
Oxidation protection of Ti–6Al–4V alloy using a novel glass–amorphous silica composite coating,"A novel glass–amorphous silica composite coating was prepared by the slurry method in order to improve the oxidation resistance of Ti–6Al–4V alloy at high temperatures. The microstructure of the as-prepared composite coating was analyzed by SEM, XRD and EDS techniques. The oxidation resistance and the microstructure evolution of the composite coating at 800°C for 50h were also studied. The results show that mass gains of the specimens coated with the composite coating were far less than that of the uncoated ones after oxidation of 50h. Thick oxide scales composed of plate-like rutile TiO2 and some granular α-Al2O3 formed on bare Ti–6Al–4V alloy, while quartz, cristobalite and diopside were observed in the composite coating, which are useful crystals for slowing the inward diffusion of oxygen to the substrate. The cross-sectional EDS line scanning images show that inward diffusion of oxygen and outward diffusion of Ti through the composite coating were insignificant. The microhardness profile reveals that the solid solution oxygen in Ti–6Al–4V alloy with composite coating was limited.","Xiao, Zunqi;Tan, Fatang;Wang, Wei;Sun, Fazhe;Lu, Hongfei;Qiu, Xiaolin;Chen, Jianguo;Qiao, Xueliang",2014-03-31,Ceramics International,"D.

Microstructure and thermal properties of nanostructured gadolinia doped yttria-stabilized zirconia thermal barrier coatings produced by air plasma spraying,"In this article, the nanostructured 2mol% Gd2O3-4.5mol% Y2O3-ZrO2(2GdYSZ) coating was developed by the atmospheric plasma spraying technique. And the microstructure and thermal properties of plasma-sprayed 2GdYSZ coating were investigated. The result from the investigation indicates that the as-sprayed coating is characterized by typical microstructure consisting of melted zones, nano-zones, splats, nano-pores, high-volume spheroidal pores and micro-cracks. The 2GdYSZ coating shows a lower resistance to destabilization of the metastable tetragonal (t′) phase compared to the yttria stabilized zirconia(YSZ). The thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity of the nano-2GdYSZ coating at room temperature are 0.431mm2 s−1 and 1.042W/m K, respectively. Addition of gadolinia to the nano-YSZ can significantly reduce the thermal conductivity compared to the nano-YSZ and the conventional YSZ. The reduction is mainly attributed to the synergetic effect of gadolinia doping along with nanostructure.","Wang, Yixiong;Zhou, Chungen",2016-08-15,Ceramics International,"Nanostructure,Thermal conductivity,Gd2O3,Yttria stabilized zirconia(YSZ)",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.084,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.084
Development of high oxidation resistant coating of nanostructured MgO on carbon nanotubes via simple precipitation technique in Mg/CO gas system,"The synthesis of oxide-coated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by a simple precipitation reaction in Mg/CO gaseous system was studied. The results showed that nanostructured MgO could be uniformly coated on the surface of CNTs via inhomogeneous Mg(g) and CO(g) precipitation reaction. Furthermore, we have developed a mixing procedure based on simultaneous agitation and ultra-sonication in order to break CNT bundles and prepare highly dispersed starting materials. By applying such mixing procedure, dispersed and distinct nano-oxide coated CNTs were synthesized which can be efficiently utilized in different composite matrices. Oxidation resistance of samples was investigated by DSC/TG thermal analysis. The results showed that oxide-coated CNTs present superior resistance against oxidation even at rather elevated temperature of 1000°C and total weight loss of coated CNTs was measured to be less than 1wt% during heat treatment at such temperature.

Improving solar thermal absorption of an anodic aluminum oxide-based photonic crystal with Cu-Ni composite nanoparticles,"In this study, an anodic aluminum oxide (AAO)-based photonic crystal, with a branched channel structure and deposited Cu-Ni composite nanoparticles, is fabricated for solar thermal absorption. The infrared-wave emission properties can be finely tuned by adjusting photonic band gap of the photonic crystal, facilitating the production of an excellent solar heat-absorbing material. Such a channel structure, as generated by anodic oxidation, possesses layers with high and low porosities, featuring a periodical change. The programmed power source (with periodically changed voltage and hence step-change current) enables sharp alteration of the porosity, forming the AAO-based photonic crystal oxidation film (with a complete photonic band gap). Subsequently, Cu-Ni composite nanoparticles are deposited into the pores of the AAO-based film at an alternating current (AC) frequency under different conditions. The optimized conditions (including periodical oxidation time, voltage, oxidation period, AC deposition voltage, time, and temperature) lead to the generation of a solar heat-absorbing composite coating that exhibits solar absorptance, thermal emissivity, and quality factor reaching values of 0.95, 0.13 and 7.3, respectively. In addition, the composite oxidation coating, with the AAO-based photonic crystal layer, shows a significantly lower thermal emissivity as compared to the counterpart in the absence of the AAO-based photonic crystal layer.","Wei, Hongyang;Hu, Huawen;Chang, Menglei;Zhang, Yuyuan;Chen, Dongchu;Wang, Meifeng",2017-10-15,Ceramics International,"Photonic crystals,Anodic oxidation,AC deposition,Cu-Ni composite nanoparticles,Absorptance,Emissivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.117,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.117
Synthesis and characterization of Ni–Al–Y2O3 composite coatings with different Y2O3 particle content,"In this work, Ni–Al–Y2O3 composite coatings with different contents of Y2O3 nanoparticles were prepared from a conventional Watt bath containing different Y2O3 particle loadings (1g/L, 2g/L, 5g/L, 10g/L). The influences of Y2O3 particle loadings in the bath on the composition, texture, grain size, microstrain, residual stress and hardness of the composite coatings were investigated. The anti-corrosion of the composite coating in NaCl and NaOH solutions were also evaluated in detail. The results showed that the Y2O3 particle content in the composite coatings increased with increasing the particle loadings. The (200) preferred orientation of the composite coating evolved to (111) preferred orientation with increasing Y2O3 particle loadings. The composite coating deposited at 5g/L showed the smaller grain size, lower tensile residual stress and the maximum hardness value.

Room temperature NO2 gas sensor based on PPy/α-Fe2O3 hybrid nanocomposites,"Polypyrrole–iron oxide (PPy/α-Fe2O3) hybrid nanocomposite sensor films were prepared by spin coating method on glass substrate and characterized for structural and morphological properties by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infra red (FTIR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which proved the strong interaction between polypyrrole and α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles. The gas-sensing properties of the hybrid nanocomposites were studied and compared with those of PPy and α-Fe2O3. It was found that PPy/α-Fe2O3 hybrid nanocomposites can complement the drawbacks of pure PPy and α-Fe2O3 to some extent. It was revealed that PPy/α-Fe2O3 (50%) hybrid sensor operating at room temperature could detect NO2 at low concentration (10ppm) with very high selectivity (18% compared to C2H5OH) and high sensitivity (56%), with better stability (85%). The sensing mechanism of PPy/α-Fe2O3 materials to NO2 was presumed to be the synergism of PPy and α-Fe2O3 or the effect of p–n heterojunctions.","Navale, S.T.;Khuspe, G.D.;Chougule, M.A.;Patil, V.B.",2014-07-31,Ceramics International,"Polymer composites,Metal oxide,X-ray diffraction,NO2 gas sensor,Selectivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.12.153,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.12.153
Investigation of thermal residual stresses during laser ablation of tantalum carbide coated graphite substrates using micro-Raman spectroscopy and COMSOL multiphysics,"Laser ablation of high-temperature ceramic coatings results in thermal residual stresses due to which the coatings fail by cracking and debonding. Hence, the measurement of such residual stresses during laser ablation process holds utmost importance from the view of performance of coatings in extreme conditions. The present research aims at investigating the effect of laser parameters such as laser pulse energy, scanning speed and line spacing on thermal residual stresses induced in tantalum carbide-coated graphite substrates. Residual stresses were measured using micro-Raman spectroscopy and correlated with Raman peak shifts. Transient thermal analysis was performed using COMSOL Multiphysics to model the single ablated track and residual stresses were reported at low, moderate and high pulse energy regimes. The results showed that the initial laser conditions caused higher tensile residual stresses. Moderate pulse energy regime comprised higher compressive residual stresses due to off centre overlapping of the laser pulses. Higher pulse energy (250 μJ), higher scanning speed (1000 mm/s) and moderate line spacing (20 μm) caused accumulation of tensile residual stresses during the final stage of laser ablation. The deviation of experimental residual stresses from COMSOL numerical model was attributed to unaccounted additional stresses induced during thermal spraying process and deformation potentials in the numerical model.","Harish, D.V.N.;Bharatish, A.;Murthy, H.N.

Wear resistance of alumina-coated oil casing steel N80 via MAO with rare earth additive,"The wear resistance of oil casing steel N80 was improved by packing its aluminide prelayer at a relative low temperature. Then, an alumina coating was obtained through microarc oxidation (MAO), in which different La2O3 contents were added into the electrolyte.

Under the simulated oil and gas well wear condition, the oil casing steel N80 with an alumina ceramic coating, which was prepared by adding 1.5g/L La2O3 in the electrolyte, showed a stable friction coefficient and low weight loss.

Enhanced machinability of SiCp/Al composites with laser-induced oxidation assisted milling,"In this study, an innovative machining process called laser-induced oxidation assisted milling (LOM) is proposed. A polycrystalline diamond (PCD) cutting tool is applied to machine 55% SiCp/Al composites. The laser-induced oxidation mechanism is investigated. Under the condition of average laser power of 10 W, laser scanning pitch of 15 μm, laser scanning speed of 6 mm/s and oxygen-rich atmosphere, the effect of laser-induced oxidation is optimal. A loose oxide layer and a sub-layer with the hardness of 160 ± 40 HV are generated where the composition of the oxide layer is mullite (2Al2O3·SiO2). Comparative investigation on the cutting force, surface quality and tool wear are performed. Compared with the conventional milling (CM), the normal force and thrust force of LOM decrease by 39% and 55%, respectively. The reduction of cutting forces is attributed to thermal failure of the interface layer. The dominant surface defects of the machined surface are particle fracture, particle pull-out, matrix tearing and matrix coating. Among the investigated parameters, the minimum surface roughness S a is 0.37 μm when the feed per tooth and the cutting depth are 0.005 mm/z and 0.2 mm, respectively. The dominant tool wear modes of LOM include diamond spalling and edge chipping. The tool wear modes of CM are diamond spalling, edge chipping, abrasive wear, and adhesive wear. LOM can prolong the tool life and achieve better surface quality under the same cutting length.","Zhao, Guolong;Hu, Maoshun;Li, Liang;Zhao, Changxi;Zhang, Jiabo;Zhang, Xiaohui",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"A.

Wetting and interfacial behavior of molten Cu on Co–Si(–Mo) coated SiC,"The wetting and spreading of molten Cu on SiC substrates with or without Co–Si(–Mo) coatings at 1120°C were investigated by the sessile drop technique. The Co–Si(–Mo) coatings on the SiC substrate were prepared by liquid phase sintering process under a vacuum. The interfacial behaviors of the coating/substrate systems and the Cu/coated SiC wetting couples were analyzed. The experimental results indicated that the final contact angle of the Cu/SiC system at 1120°C, for a holding time of 10min, decreased from ~142° without coating to 12°, 15–27° and 7° with the corresponding Co–Si, Co–Si–10Mo and Co–Si–20Mo coatings. This result was closely related with the interactions between the Cu drop and the coatings. No reaction layer was observed at any of the coating/SiC interfaces before the wetting tests. However, a thin Mo–Co–Cu–Si layer and a graphitization layer with different thicknesses formed at the Cu/Co–Si–10Mo coated SiC and Cu/Co–Si–20Mo coated SiC interfaces. Moreover, the graphitization layer disappeared at the Cu/Co–Si–10Mo coated SiC interface when the thickness of the Co–Si–10Mo coating increased to ~60μm.","Zhao, S.T.;Zhang, X.Z.;Liu, G.W.;Valenza, F.;Muolo, M.L.;Qiao, G.J.;Passerone, A.",2015-12-31,Ceramics International,"B.

"The role of Y2O3 in fine-grained (Y,Mg)-PSZ/MgAl2O4 during long term heat treatment","Fine-grained (Y, Mg)-PSZ/MgAl2O4 ceramics are prepared by coating-coprecipitation technology. This kind of material exhibits very good thermal stability at 1100°C for it possesses strength values over 900MPa and toughness over 15MPam1/2 even as the ageing time reaches 800h. The microstructures and phase compositions are examined with XRD, SEM and TEM. The results show that the material derives from a new sub-eutectoid decomposition reaction: c-ZrO2→c′-ZrO2+t-ZrO2+MgO, which is different from the thermal decomposition of conventional Mg-PSZ without Y2O3 addition. Furthermore, two kinds of precipitations can be detected according to their stabilizer. It is found that the tweed-like and colony-like t-ZrO2 phases in the ceramics, which are stabilized by Y2O3, can grow up and lead to an increase in volume of the transformable t-ZrO2 with heat treatment. Only the transformable t-ZrO2, originating from the eutectoid decomposition of Css, plays an important role in toughening the matrix. 1998 Elsevier Science Limited and Techna S.r.l.","Qi, Zhang;Yuru, Chen;Houzheng, Wu;Wenxi, Liu;Qiming, Yuan",1998-05-31,Ceramics International, ,10.1016/S0272-8842(96)00087-9,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0272-8842(96)00087-9
The role of impurities on electrochemical properties of LiFePO4 cathode material,"LiFePO4, one of the attractive cathode materials for lithium ion batteries, is obtained by lithiation of pre-synthesized FePO4 using lithium carbonate as lithium source. Inexpensive reducing agent glucose was used for the reduction process. Glucose acted as a conductive additive as well. Lithium ion conductive impurity phase can be attributed to the capacity improvement in LiFePO4 with carbon coating. The off-stoichiometric Li x FePO4 (x=1.005, 1.010) was synthesized to generate a conductive pyrophosphate layer. An electron conductive layer with carbon coating was also concurrently formed by carbothermal reduction of glucose. It is observed that the electrochemical property improves with increasing amount of lithium pyrophosphate impurity phase. This observable fact may be due to accelerating lithium ion diffusion on the lithium ion conductive lithium pyrophosphate layer. XRD and SEM observation show that the Li x FePO4/C composite has good crystallinity and well-dispersed particles of 200–300nm size. The Li x FePO4/C (x=1.010) composite shows a high discharge capacity of 150mAhg−1 and 136mAhg−1 at rates of 0.1C and 1C respectively with satisfactory capacity retention.","Yoon, Man-Soon;Islam, Mobinul;Ur, Soon-Chul",2013-05-31,Ceramics International,"B.

Achieving high anti-wear ability of V–C–N coatings in seawater by carbon content design,"The V–C–N coatings with various carbon contents were prepared by multi-arc ion plating method on 304 stainless steel and Si (100) substrates. The effects of carbon content on microstructure, mechanical behavior, tribological behavior and corrosion behavior of V–C–N coating were systematically evaluated. Results showed that the VC phase and amorphous phase were formed after the addition of carbon into VN coating. In the meantime, the critical load and hardness of V–C–N coating increased to 40 N and 36.5 GPa when the carbon content increased to 14.73 at%, respectively. Moreover, the incorporation of carbon could enhance the toughness, corrosion resistance and wear resistance of VN coating. By comparison, the V–C–N coating with 14.73 at.% C showed the lowest friction coefficient (COF = 0.12) and wear rate (7.2 × 10−7 mm3/Nm), implying a great potential for the protection of mechanical component in marine environment.","Liu, Zhixiong;Ye, Yuwei;Jiang, Zilong;Chen, Hao;Song, Wenfeng;Liu, Zijing;Jia, Yuhao;Zhu, Jianjun",2020-04-01,Ceramics International,"V-C-N coating,Carbon content,Toughness,Wear,Seawater",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.148,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.148
Abrasion resistant semitransparent self-cleaning coatings based on porous silica microspheres and polydimethylsiloxane,"Transparent, abrasion-resistant and superhydrophobic coatings have attracted considerable interest owing to their great advantages in applications. In this work, a semitransparent abrasion-resistant superhydrophobic coating was attained via depositing suspensions of porous silica microspheres and polydimethylsiloxane, followed by calcining and fluorating process. Herein, the porous silica microspheres were fabricated through a template method. Consequently, the coating exhibited a water contact angle of 153°, a hexane contact angle of 100° and an average optical transparency of 78%. Significantly, the coating displayed a robust resistance against sandpaper abrasion and knife-scratch. Furthermore, the coating also exhibited excellent self-cleaning performance even after it was contaminated by oil.","Su, Qinqin;Wen, Fubin;Huang, Yuewen;Wang, Bin",2019-01-31,Ceramics International,"semitransparent,abrasion-resistant,superhydrophobic,suspensions,self-cleaning property",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.180,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.180
Preparation and characterization of Al3+-doped TiO2 tight ultrafiltration membrane for efficient dye removal,"Al3+-doped TiO2 (AT) tight ultrafiltration membrane with stable anatase phase was prepared by a modified sol-gel process using butyl titanate and aluminum chloride as the precursor and aluminum source respectively. The removal of Alizarin red-S was investigated by filtration experiment. A dip-coating process on homemade flat Al2O3 intermediate layer by TiO2 sol followed by heat treatment was adopted to obtain the desired AT membrane. The addition of Al3+ inhibits the phase transformation of nanosized TiO2 from anatase to rutile and restrains the growth of crystallite, resulting in the pore size of the separation layer reducing to 3.5 nm. The prepared AT1-500 membrane exhibits enhanced hydrophilicity with no cracks or pinholes, and shows a water permeability of 9.6 L m-2 h−1 bar−1 and cut-off molecular weight (MWCO) of 4650 Da. The membrane demonstrated a retention rate of 96.9% for Alizarin Red-S (250 ppm) and maintained almost constant under repeated using.","Huang, Xin;Tian, Chao;Qin, Hang;Guo, Wenming;Gao, Pengzhao;Xiao, Hanning",2020-03-31,Ceramics International,"Titania membrane,Ultrafiltration,Sol-gel process,Dye removal",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.199,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.199
Influence of WS2 content on high temperature wear performance of magnetron sputtered TiN-WSx thin films,"TiN-WSx thin films with varying WSx content were co-deposited by reactive magnetron sputtering. GAXRD analyses showed that the addition of 4 at.% WSx led to loss of crystallinity of TiN phase and a complete amorphous characteristic was manifested upon incorporation of 19 at.% WSx. Nanohardness results indicated that TiN-WSx containing 4 and 19 at.% WSx presented 19.7 GPa and 18.4 GPa, respectively, following the rule of mixtures. Friction coefficient and wear rates measured in reciprocated tribological tests revealed that TiN-WSx coatings present an improved tribological performance when compared to pure TiN thin film at room temperature, registering friction coefficient of 0.42 ± 0.05 and 0.19 ± 0.03 for samples with 4 and 19 at.% WSx, respectively. Wear tests at high temperatures evidenced that sample with 4 at.% WSx did not provide advanced protection to substrate at 343 K and above due to deterioration. On the other hand, coating with 19 at.% WSx maintained low friction coefficient up to 343 K, registering an optimum wear rate of 0.86 × 10−17 m2/N with no cracking occurrence.","Serra, E.C.;Soares, V.F.D.;Fernandez, D.A.R.;Hübler, R.;Juste, K.R.C.;Lima, C.L.;Tentardini, E.K.",2019-11-30,Ceramics International,"TiN-WS2,High temperature wear,Self-lubricating coating,Thin films,Magnetron sputtering",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.248,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.248
Microstructures and mechanical properties of an a-C:N film as the interlayer and the outmost layer of a DLC-deposited Ti bio-alloy,"An amorphous carbon nitride (a-C: N) interlayer was deposited by radio frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (rf PECVD) using a mixture of methane (CH4) and nitrogen gases to improve the adhesion between diamond-like carbon (DLC) films and Ti6Al4V substrate. The DLC film was deposited by the same technique using a mixture of CH4 and hydrogen precursors. Another sample, deposited with an additional a-C:N outmost layer on the mentioned DLC coating, was also proposed to study the characteristics of the interface between a-C:N and DLC films. The structures and film thicknesses of the DLC and a-C:N coatings were investigated by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The mechanical properties were evaluated by indentation and scratch tests. The results showed that depositing an a-C:N film on Ti alloy and on DLC film by a continuous rf PECVD procedure can modify the coated materials and improve adhesion. However, the additional a-C:N film deposited on the DLC/a-C:N coating was not suitable for the softer Ti6Al4V substrate due to its brittle nature when subjected to concentrated loading. To summarize, depositing an a-C:N film as the interlayer between DLC coating and Ti biomedical alloy is a promising alternative to the amorphous Si interlayer which is widely used in medical applications.","Chou, Chau-Chang;Lin, Jyun-Sin;Wu, Rudder",2017-08-31,Ceramics International,"A Films,B Interfaces,D Carbides,E Biomedical applications",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.196,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.196
Metal-supported SOFC with an aerosol deposited in-situ LSM and 8YSZ composite cathode,"This study reports the micro-structural and electrochemical properties of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells (MS-SOFCs) with an La0.8Sr0.2MnO3−d (LSM)/8mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ) composite cathode, fabricated at room temperature using the aerosol deposition process (ADP). The composite cathode fabricated with the ADP technique shows uniform distribution of components and pores and the interface between the cathode and the electrolyte displays excellent joining properties. The area specific resistance (ASR) of the ADP-LSM/8YSZ sample is approximately 1.50Ωcm2 at 800°C, so this sample shows a significantly lower ASR value than the values usually reported for samples fabricated by the in-situ treatment method for MS-SOFCs. The power density of the cells with the ADP-LSM/8YSZ cathode coated on MS-SOFCs shows a maximum value of 0.38mWcm−2 at 800°C and stable performance in the severe thermal durability test. Therefore, these research results can broaden the opportunities for adoption of the ADP coating processes to fabricate cathode materials in MS-SOFCs.","Baek, Seung-Wook;Jeong, Jihoon;Schlegl, Harald;Azad, Abul K.;Park, Dae Soo;Baek, Un Bong;Kim, Jung Hyun",2016-02-01,Ceramics International,"Metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells (MS-SOFCs),Aerosol deposition process (ADP),Cathode,Sintering process,Electrochemical property",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.10.039,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.10.039
Scratch and wear resistance of hydrophobic CeO2-x coatings synthesized by reactive magnetron sputtering,"CeO2-x coatings were deposited under variable oxygen flow ratios (%fO2) onto Si substrates by reactive magnetron sputtering. Nanoindentation testing revealed an increase in the hardness, elastic modulus, H/E and H3/E2 ratio with increasing oxygen flow ratio, which in turn increased the adhesion and tribological performance of the coatings. Scratch testing yielded the highest critical load (LC2 = 28.8 N) and CPRS = 103 for the coating deposited with the highest oxygen flow ratio (57 %fO2). Cracking events during scratch testing were initiated by tensile forces behind the scratch stylus, which led to the formation of semi-circular ring cracks. As the normal load increased, transverse cracks emerged extending outwards from the scratch track towards the edge causing the exposure of substrate. Beyond LC2, severe spallation of the CeO2-x coatings led to coating failure. Furthermore, the specific wear rates of the CeO2-x coatings were determined to be within the ~10−15 m3/Nm range influenced by three-body abrasive wear. In-depth analyses from scratch and wear data indicates that these coatings possess good adhesion and durability.","Kabir, Mohammad Sharear;Zhou, Zhifeng;Xie, Zonghan;Munroe, Paul",2020-01-31,Ceramics International,"Reactive magnetron sputtering,Cerium oxide coating,Scratch toughness,Tribological performance,Durability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.237,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.237
Comparative study on crack resistance of TiAlN monolithic and Ti/TiAlN multilayer coatings,"TiAlN monolithic and Ti/TiAlN multilayer coatings were fabricated on Ti–6Al–4V substrates by a self-designed multisource cathodic arc ion deposition system. The mechanical properties and crack evolution of the coatings were focused under scratch tests with different constant loads. Results showed that the multilayer coating exhibited a higher combination of plasticity, crack resistance and load capacity comparing to those of the monolithic coating. Namely, radical cracks, chippings, and lateral cracks were observed in the monolithic coating after scratch test, whereas only radical cracks occurred in the multilayer coating. The surface and cross-sectional morphology of the scratch tracks revealed that bending and shear stress were responsible for the failure of the two coatings. In particular, the ductile Ti layers within the multilayer coatings could coordinate the deformation and enhance the adhesion between the substrate and the brittle TiAlN layers, which further hindered the propagation of cracks, resulting in a higher crack resistance.","Shuai, Jintao;Zuo, Xiao;Wang, Zhenyu;Guo, Peng;Xu, Beibei;Zhou, Jia;Wang, Aiying;Ke, Peiling",2020-04-01,Ceramics International,"TiAlN,Multilayer coating,Nanoindentation,Scratch test,Crack resistance,Failure mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.155,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.155
Low friction nanocomposite aluminum oxide/MoS2 coatings prepared by sol-gel method,"Decreasing of friction coefficient by lubrication is an effective way to reduce the wear of interacting surfaces, however, use of conventional lubricants faces problems in extreme environments (e.g. outer space). The use of solid lubricants (e.g. molybdenum disulfide) as solid coatings, or as components of coating systems based on non triboactive matrix (e.g. oxides) can be solution. In this work, aluminum oxide ceramic coating containing dispersed molybdenum disulfide particles was formed on the substrates using sol-gel technique. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) powder was suspended in alumina sol and deposited by dip-coating method on the surface of 7075 Al alloy and Si wafer. The densification of coating was made during heat treatment of substrate alloy. Prepared coatings were investigated in terms of morphology, chemical composition, crystalline structure and basic tribological properties. Morphology study of the obtained coatings revealed that their nanocomposite structure consisted of MoS2 particles uniformly dispersed in aluminum oxide matrix. The coatings were homogeneous and free of cracks. EDS and GIXRD study proved high MoS2 content within coatings. Tribological investigations carried out under low humidity conditions showed very low friction coefficient of coatings against Al2O3 counterspecimen. The interaction of MoS2 particles with aluminum oxide matrix was simulated using the SCiGRESS software. The conducted analysis showed that the dispersed MoS2 could be incorporated into the amorphous structure of aluminum oxide both by physical and chemical bonding. Obtained results indicate the potential use of MoS2 containing nanocomposite coating in contact nodes operating under outer space conditions.","Pietrzyk, Bożena;Miszczak, Sebastian;Kaczmarek, Łukasz;Klich, Marek",2018-05-31,Ceramics International,"Nanocomposite,Wear resistant,Sol-gel,MoS2,Solid lubricant,Alumina",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.055,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.055
Fabrication and photocatalysis of nanostructured TiO2 for solar hydrogen production,"Photoelectrochemical cells (PEC) based on metal-doped (Be and Fe) and Pt-loaded nanostructured-TiO2 films were fabricated to make working electrodes for solar hydrogen production. Anatase nanocrystalline titania (nano-TiO2) thin films were deposited on glass slide and Ti metal sheet substrates by a sol–gel dip-coating method. Titanium tetraisopropoxide was used as a precursor. The synthesis process and annealing temperatures play an important role on the crystallite size and the phase transformation of nano-TiO2. The diameter of the particles in the rage of 5–50nm was obtained in different methods of making the sol-gels and annealing temperatures. Without an external applied potential, the photocurrent density of Be-doped PEC occurred of 0.32mA/cm2 under illumination of 75mW/cm2 and the device produced hydrogen by water photoelectrolysis at the rate of 0.1ml/hcm2, with a photoconversion efficiencies of 0.52%. The maximum photocurrent density of Fe-doped PEC occurred of 0.80mA/cm2 without an external applied potential and under the illumination of 100mW/cm2 corresponding with photoconversion efficiency of 0.98%.

Influence of curing temperature on corrosion protection property of chemically bonded phosphate ceramic coatings with nano-titanium dioxide reinforcement,"In this study, the chemically bonded phosphate ceramic coating reinforced with nano-titanium dioxide is prepared on the AISI 304L stainless steel by different curing temperatures. The structure evolution, surface roughness, wettability and corrosion resistance of the coating are investigated. The results indicate that with the increase of the curing temperature, the main curing reactions become different, resulting in different reactants as the bonded phase. When the curing temperature increases, the bonded phase translates from aluminum hydrogen phosphate hydrate (AlH3(PO4)2·3H2O) phase to berlinite (AlPO4) phase, leading to the increase of the corrosion protection property of the coating. That is because berlinite phase can provide a strong bond between ceramic particles and enhance the strength of the coating. Moreover, berlinite phase possesses the low density and more likely distributes on the surface of the coating, which can more effectively protect the stainless steel free from chloride ions destruction. In addition, berlinite phase also increases with the introduction of nano-titanium dioxide. However, compared with nano-titanium dioxide, the curing temperature can better promote the formation of berlinite phase. Therefore, the curing temperature more contributes to the wettability and corrosion protection property of the coating.","Liu, Yaxuan;Bian, Da;Zhao, Yongwu;Wang, Yongguang",2019-02-01,Ceramics International,"Chemically bonded phosphate ceramic coating,Corrosion protection property,Curing temperature,Nano-titanium dioxide",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.034,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.034
Influence of annealing temperature on microstructure evolution of TiAlSiN coating and its tribological behavior against Ti6Al4V alloys,"TiAlSiN multicomponent coating, owing to its high hardness and excellent high temperature resistance, was widely used in the cutting field of difficult-to-cut materials such as titanium alloys. For machining titanium alloys, high temperature is easy to gather on the tool chips and deteriorate the cutting tools. Moreover, high temperature will also promote the microstructure evolution and make the wear mechanism more complex. In this paper, TiAlSiN coatings were deposited on cemented carbides and annealed at 400 °C, 600 °C and 800 °C respectively for 60 min in air, followed by reciprocating friction tests against Ti6Al4V counterparts. AFM, SEM, EDS and XPS were applied to investigate the microstructure evolution and tribological behavior of TiAlSiN coating after high temperature annealing. The results demonstrated that the oxidation resistance of TiN phase in TiAlSiN coating was worse than Si3N4 and AlN phases. These nitrides can be oxidized to TiO2, SiOx and AlOx under 600 °C, and the depth of oxide layer was increased with the rising annealing temperature, resulting in the coarsened microstructure. The wear mechanisms of as-deposited TiAlSiN coating were oxidation wear and adhesion wear. With the rising annealing temperature, abrasive wear was gradually enhanced. For the TiAlSiN coating annealed at 800 °C, abrasive wear became the dominant wear mechanism.","Hong, Dongbo;Huang, Lei;Yuan, Juntang;Li, Chao",2020-09-28,Ceramics International,"Annealing,TiAlSiN coating,Microstructure,Tribological behavior,Ti6Al4V",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.236,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.236

SEM, XRD, EDS and microhardness tester were used to analyze the effect of different rare earth oxide doping content on the morphology, composition and mechanical properties of the coatings. The results showed that with the increase of rare earth oxide doping content, the porosity of the coatings decreased, and the microhardness and fracture toughness increased. When the doping amount of rare earth oxide is 1.0 mol%, the bonding strength and thermal cycle times of the coating are the highest, 33.4 Mpa and 185 times respectively. With the increase of the doping amount of rare earth, the luminous intensity of the sprayed coating increases. After thermal shock test, the luminous intensity of Eu2O3-doped YSZ coatings at 592 and 608 nm decreased to a certain extent.","Haoliang, Tian;Changliang, Wang;Mengqiu, Guo;Junguo, Gao;Yongjing, Cui;Fuyuan, Wang;Erbao, Liu;Guo, Jin",2020-03-31,Ceramics International,"Rare earth oxides,Thermal barrier coatings,Mechanical properties,Luminous intensity,Thermal shock properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.170,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.170
Preparation of Pd-doped Y3Al5O12 thermal barrier coatings using cathode plasma electrolytic deposition,"Here, noble metal Pd-doped Y3Al5O12 thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) were efficaciously prepared by means of cathode plasma electrolytic deposition (CPED).

The results indicated that the preparation of the Y3Al5O12 TBCs by using the CPED method could be divided into three stages, and the phase compositions of the coatings obtained with different deposition times were different. A single-phase Y3Al5O12 TBCs with a 115-μm thickness was obtained after a deposition time of 20 min.

"Structural, mechanical and tribological properties of Ti and TiN coatings on 316L stainless steel","316L stainless steel is commonly used in biomedical applications. However, its use is limited because of its insufficient tribological properties. In this study, a duplex surface modification process of laser melting and plasma nitriding is proposed and wear characteristics of coated 316L stainless steel were investigated. Titanium layers were produced on 316L steel samples at laser powers of 20 and 40 W by selective laser melting. The obtained films were plasma nitrided at 650 and 750 °C for 4 h under a gas mixture of 50% N2–50% H2. The structural, mechanical, morphological and tribological properties of untreated and processed samples were examined. It was observed that the hardness and wear resistance of coated and plasma nitrided samples were higher than the uncoated and Ti coated samples due to the formation of titanium nitride phases during nitridation. Also, the results indicated that wear resistance of Ti coated and plasma nitrided samples improved with increasing plasma nitriding temperature and laser power.","Yazıcı, M.;Kovacı, H.;Yetim, A.F.;Çelik, A.",2018-08-15,Ceramics International,"Selective laser melting,Wear,Plasma nitriding,Cp-Ti,AISI 316L",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.022
Electrical insulation improvements of ceramic coating for high temperature sensors embedded on aeroengine turbine blade,"Intelligent aeroengine requires high temperature sensors, especially MEMS thin film sensors directly fabricated on the surface of turbine blade. For this purpose, an electrical insulation layer is needed on blade substrate metals. However, the electrical insulation of ceramic materials will degrade at high temperatures, thereby affecting the characteristics of the sensor. In this paper, ceramic material of YSZ thermal barrier coating (TBC) formulation was modified by adding a certain amount of Al2O3 to improve its insulation at high temperatures. Micro processing was carried out on the surface of the TBC, including the fabrication of platinum-point thermocouples and thermal resistor on TBC surface, and high temperature electrical insulation properties of the modified TBC were studied. Results show that electrical insulation can be improved several orders of magnitude with adding Al2O3 which meets the requirement to build reliable thin film sensors on the top of TBC surface coated on turbine blade metals. Several verification experiments were carried out to ensure the working ability of TBC layer, including robustness test, thermal shock test and high temperature retention test.","Weng, Haotian;Duan, Franklin Li;Ji, Zhonglin;Chen, Xi;Yang, Zhi;Zhang, Yafei;Zou, Binglin",2020-02-15,Ceramics International,"Sensors,Electrical properties,Al2O3,ZrO2",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.078,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.078
Anti-wear hierarchical TiC enhanced cermet coating obtained via electrical discharge coating using a reduced graphene oxide nanosheets mixed dielectric,"The use of a powder mixed dielectric is one of the promising measures to overcome defects such as non-uniform thickness, voids and micro-cracks of hard coatings obtained via the electrical discharge coating (EDC) process. The quest for finding appropriate powders suspended in EDC dielectric still continues. In this paper, reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (RGONS) are explored as the additives of EDC dielectric to fabricate TiC containing composite coatings with superior tribological performance. The influences of RGONS on the surface integrity, microstructure and tribological performance of the as-prepared coatings are investigated. RGONS with lipophilic modification effectively reduce spark energy and disperse the discharges throughout the machined surface due to their uniform dispersion in the discharge gap. This allows the formation of compact coatings with banded microstructure composing of a mixture of equiaxed and columnar TiC grains within the martensite matrix. Such unique microstructure improves the as-prepared coatings’ resistance to adhesion and abrasion wear, as well as fatigue and fracture. As a result, they show obviously lower coefficient of friction and wear rate compared to the coatings obtained using a bare dielectric.","Li, S.L.;Mai, Y.J.;Huang, M.Y.;Jie, X.H.",2020-06-01,Ceramics International,"Electrical discharge coating,Graphene,Powder mixed dielectric,Cermet coating,Wear resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.231,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.231
"Multifunctional ZnO/TiO2 nanoarray composite coating with antibacterial activity, cytocompatibility and piezoelectricity","Metal oxides with nanostructures such as zinc oxide (ZnO), titanium dioxide (TiO2) have been used in biomedical fields for their multifunctional properties. In this study, ZnO/TiO2 nanoarray (nZnO/TiO2) coatings were prepared via hydrothermal synthesis followed by low temperature liquid phase method. The particle size of the composites were no more than 100 nm in diameter, assembled into nanoarray on the Ti substrate. In vitro antibacterial experiments showed that the maximum bacteriostatic rate could reach 99% against Staphylococcus aureus and 90% against Escherichia coli, respectively. Moreover, the nZnO/TiO2 coatings were of cytocompatibility and biocompatibility, promoting the proliferation of MC3T3-E1 and the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP). The piezoelectric properties of nZnO/TiO2 coatings were preliminarily investigated. The smaller the size of the composite particle was, the better the antibacterial property, biocompatibility and piezoelectric properties were. Under the stimulation of the periodic loading, the growth of MC3T3-E1 was promoted, so the secretion of ALP was. The nZnO/TiO2 composite coating with antibacterial activity, osteogenesis and intellectual stimulation would be a promising smart coating for orthopedic implants.","Pang, Shumin;He, Yuan;Zhong, Ru;Guo, Zhenzhao;He, Ping;Zhou, Changren;Xue, Bo;Wen, Xuejun;Li, Hong",2019-07-31,Ceramics International,"ZnO,TiO2,Nanoarray,Antibacterial activity,Biocompatibility,Piezoelectricity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.076,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.076
The effect of temperature on the dry sliding wear behavior of HVOF sprayed nanostructured WC-CoCr coatings,"The sliding wear properties of high-velocity oxygen-fuel (HVOF) sprayed nanostructured WC-CoCr cermet coatings against Al2O3 under dry friction at different temperatures were investigated using a pin-on-disk high-temperature tribometer. The microhardness data of the coatings were also statistically analyzed by using the Weibull distribution. The results showed that nanostructured coatings exhibited a mono-modal distribution under indentation load of 100g, and a bimodal distribution under indentation load of 300g. With increasing test temperature, the coatings showed an increase in wear rate. The evolution of the sliding wear mechanism of the coatings with the increase of the temperature was extrusion deformation at room temperature, carbide particle pull-out, oxidation wear and adhesive wear at 200°C, and a combination of binder extrusion and fatigue delamination coupled with oxidation wear at 500°C.","Hong, Sheng;Wu, Yuping;Wang, Bo;Zhang, Jianfeng;Zheng, Yuan;Qiao, Lei",2017-01-31,Ceramics International,"High-velocity oxygen-fuel,WC-CoCr,Nanostructured,Temperature,Wear",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.09.180,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.09.180
"Structural, electro-optical, and mechanical properties of reactively sputtered (TiZrHf)N coatings","Within the frame of this work, reactive magnetron-sputtered (TiZrHf)N coatings were deposited on Si substrates. The depositions were carried out from a pure TiZrHf target with varying N2-to-total (N2+Ar) flow ratios, R N. The TiZrHf alloy and its nitride coatings exhibited body-centered cubic and face-centered cubic crystal structures, respectively. The increase in R N contributed to the decrease in O2 contamination. For nitrides, with increasing R N, the grain size decreased to a nano-sized level. Consequently, the microstructure of the nitride coatings was converted from a large columnar structure with rough surface to a fine columnar structure with a smooth surface. Moreover, the compressive stress and the corresponding lattice parameter increased initially and then decreased. The golden-like (TiZrHf)N coatings deposited at R N=20% exhibited the highest hardness of 40.7GPa, which attained the superhard grade. Meanwhile, low electrical resistivity of 129.2μΩ-cm and high reflectivity at 0.62eV of 84.0% were obtained. The electro-optical behavior of (TiZrHf)N coatings was demonstrated further by spectroscopic ellipsometry on the basis of their dielectric function and energy loss function. The gold-colored (TiZrHf)N coating with excellent physical properties has a wide range of diverse potential industrial applications.","Tsai, Du-Cheng;Chang, Zue-Chin;Kuo, Bing-Hau;Liu, Yung-Cheng;Chen, Erh-Chiang;Shieu, Fuh-Sheng",2016-09-30,Ceramics International,"Coating materials,Nitride materials,Vapor deposition,Crystal structure,Scanning electron microscopy, sem",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.055,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.055
Degradation of TiAlN coatings by the accelerated life test using pulsed laser ablation,"The degradation behaviors of TiAlN coatings were evaluated by an accelerated life test under thermo-mechanical loading using a Nd:YAG pulsed laser ablation system. Pulse laser levels were chosen based on finite element analysis, and failure was determined when the specimen hardness decreased below 50% from its initial value. The accelerated life test was conducted on both TiAlN and TiN coatings deposited on an Inconel 617 substrate. The predicted lifetimes were obtained through statistical analysis of the failure time data. Surface and cross-sectional microstructural observations of the ablated spots were made to identify the cause for the difference in lifetimes since the TiAlN coating lasted longer than the TiN coatings by a factor of ~1.7. Pores formed on the TiAlN coating surface by the repeated laser ablation, and surface cracking and delamination of the coating layers were observed on the ablated spots in the failed specimens. The TiN coating also showed surface cracks with fewer surface pores than the TiAlN coating, but spalling of the coating layer occurred due to bursting of the substrate. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) depth profiling revealed that surface oxidation increased in the TiN coating as the number of laser pulses increased, while the TiAlN coating showed less surface oxidation. The surface oxidation and spalling of the coating layer is considered to be the dominant influence on the decrease in hardness of the TiN coating. The TiAlN coating retains its hardness longer due to its lower thermal conductivity and higher oxidation resistance, as compared to the TiN coating.","Jeon, Seol;Van Tyne, Chester J.;Lee, Heesoo",2014-07-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Influence of hydrogen on growth and microstructure of boron nitride coatings obtained from BCl3–NH3–H2 system by chemical vapor infiltration,"Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) interfacial coatings were prepared by chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) process from BCl3–NH3–H2 system with different hydrogen contents for improving the toughness of ceramic matrix composites. In this study, the yield of BN was found to be 94.90% without hydrogen present in the reactant system as calculated via FactSage, while it reached 99.95% at the [H2]/[BCl3] ratio of 10 and the [NH3]/[BCl3] ratio of 1, when chemical equilibrium was reached. BN interfacial coatings containing mixture of hexagonal and turbostratic phases were obtained. The deposition rate of coating increased from 18.2 ± 0.4 nm min−1 (β = 0) to 23.0 ± 0.4 nm min−1 (β = 5) with the increase of hydrogen content in reactants, then it significantly decreased when β was 10. Owing to different nucleation amounts on the surface of fibers, samples S2 (β = 2) and S3 (β = 5) exhibited particles with circular shapes and smooth surfaces, while the other coatings presented particles with polygonal shapes and rough surfaces. Moreover, the onset temperature of weight gain of sample S2 was 102 °C higher than that of sample S4, thus indicating the enhancement of the high-temperature oxidation resistance of BN coating.","Dai, Jianwei;Wang, Yiguang;Xu, Zhenhua;Mu, Rende;He, Limin",2020-06-15,Ceramics International,"Hexagonal boron nitride,Chemical vapor infiltration,BCl3–NH3–H2 system,Deposition rate,Microstructure,High-temperature stability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.078,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.078

Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy, Differential Thermal Analysis and X-ray Diffractometer were employed to study morphology, thermal behavior and structure of powder, respectively. To investigate magnetic and reflection loss properties, Vibrating Sample Magnetometer and Vector Network Analyzer were used. Particle size distribution and zeta potential was obtained by Dynamic Light Scattering device. It was observed that by optimizing voltage amount and time to 25V and 6min, respectively; uniformity of coating was improved and this led to the highest attenuation of −10.25dB in vicinity of 8–12GHz.","Salimkhani, H.;Motei Dizaji, A.;Hashemi, E.;Palmeh, P.;Sabeghi, G.;Salimkhani, S.",2016-08-15,Ceramics International,"Cobalt ferrite nanoparticles,Carbon fibers,Electrophoretic deposition,Absorption",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.185,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.185
PVP derived C/N coated SrLi2Ti6O14 as high performance anode material for lithium ion battery,"SrLi2Ti6O14@C/N is synthesized by using a solid-state assisted solution method, with polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) as carbon/nitrogen source. The morphology of SrLi2Ti6O14 and SrLi2Ti6O14@C/N samples are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and elemental mappings. According to the results, C/N layer is uniformly coated on the surface of SrLi2Ti6O14. Subsequently, the two samples are analyzed by using electrochemical measurements such as galvanostatic charge/discharge tests, rate performance, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). SrLi2Ti6O14@C/N (initial charge capacity of 166.41 mAh g−1) shows enhanced electrochemical capability compared with SrLi2Ti6O14 (156.06 mAh g−1). After 150 cycles, SrLi2Ti6O14@C/N can keep a reversible capacity of 156.58 mAh g−1 with only 5.98% capacity loss at 100mAg−1. The improvement is due to the increase of electronic conductivity and the decrease in the redox polarization after coating. Moreover, in-situ XRD is also used to investigate the structural stability of SrLi2Ti6O14@C/N. All the results prove that the C/N coating has a positive effect on the electrochemical performance of SrLi2Ti6O14.","Zhang, Yanyu;Qian, Shangshu;Zhu, Haojie;Cheng, Xing;Ye, Wuquan;Yu, Haoxiang;Yan, Lei;Shui, Miao;Shu, Jie",2017-10-15,Ceramics International,"SrLi2Ti6O14,C/N coating,Anode material,In-situ XRD",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.101,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.101
Lanthanum cerate thermal barrier coatings generated from thermal plasma synthesized powders,"Lanthanum cerate (La2Ce2O7, LC) is one of the promising advanced thermal barrier coating (TBC) materials due to its high melting point, no phase transformation between room temperature and operating temperature, low thermal conductivity, comparable coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) with metallic substrate. The present study investigates plasma transferred arc synthesis of LC powder, its subsequent spheroidization in a thermal plasma jet and plasma spray deposition. The PTA-synthesized LC powder, spheroidized as well as the plasma sprayed coatings was found to possess excellent phase stability; the single phase cubic fluorite structure of LC was found to be retained even after prolonged arc-melting, corroborating that the material was stable from room temperature up to its melting point. It was observed that PTA melting for longer duration resulted in small deviation from stoichiometry, although the phase structure of LC was retained. Spheroidization efficiency was found to increase with the input power of the torch. Very good adherent LC coatings could be deposited on nickel super alloy with reasonably good deposition efficiency.","Praveen, K.;Sivakumar, S.;Ananthapadmanabhan, P.V.;Shanmugavelayutham, G.",2018-04-15,Ceramics International,"Lanthanum cerate,Thermal barrier coatings,Plasma transferred arc,Chunks,Spheroidization",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.036,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.036
Microstructure of HVOF-sprayed Ag–BaF2⋅CaF2–Cr3C2–NiCr coating and its tribological behavior in a wide temperature range (25 °C to 800 °C),"Ag–BaF2⋅CaF2–Cr3C2–NiCr composite powders were prepared by physically blending commercial BaF2⋅CaF2–Cr3C2–NiCr and Ag powders. Ag–BaF2⋅CaF2–Cr3C2–NiCr composite coatings were deposited on Inconel 718 alloy substrate by high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) spraying. The friction and wear behavior of the coatings under dry sliding against Si3N4 balls from 25 °C to 800 °C was evaluated with a ball-on-disk high temperature tribometer. The microstructure and composition of the samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectrometer. Results showed that the composite coatings were mainly composed of hard phase of Cr3C2, binder phase of NiCr, high-temperature lubrication phase of fluorides and low-temperature lubrication phase of Ag. The fluorides existed in the forms of both crystal particles and amorphous state, while the silver featured as typical thermally sprayed splats. Due to the high flame temperature, some fluorides have been oxidized to chromates and around 30 wt% of Ag was lost during spraying. In addition, it was found that Ag content had an important influence on the composite coating, and an appropriate dosage of metallic silver could effectively improve the tribological performance of the coating. The generation of AgCrO2 at moderate (500 °C and 650 °C) temperature and BaCrO4 at high temperature (800 °C) could contribute to the decline in friction coefficients and wear rates of Ag–BaF2⋅CaF2–Cr3C2–NiCr coatings.","Su, Weiming;Zhang, Jiaping;Zhang, Jifu;Zhou, Kesong;Niu, Shaopeng;Liu, Min;Dai, Hongliang;Deng, Chunming",2020-08-25,Ceramics International,"Ag-BaF2⋅CaF2–Cr3C2–NiCr composite Coating,HVOF spraying,High-temperature friction and wear behavior,Self-lubricating coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.199,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.199
Studies on plasma sprayed bi-layered ceramic coating on bio-medical Ti–13Nb–13Zr alloy,"Biomedical Ti alloys are prone to undergo degradation due to the combined effect of wear and corrosion.

In this paper, the biomedical Ti alloy Ti–13Nb–13Zr was plasma sprayed with nanostructured Al2O3–13wt%TiO2, yttria stabilized zirconia powders and bilayer containing alternate layers of the two coatings to improve the corrosion resistance and microhardness of the substrate. The plasma sprayed coatings were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy.

ZrOCl2·8H2O was used as zirconium (Zr) precursors. Annealing of as-coated ZrO2 thin films is important in order to stiffen the respective films and to remove the Pluronic P123. The mesoporous structure and crystallite size of ZrO2 were characterized systematically by field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), both low- and wide-angle X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis technique and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method. At annealing temperature of 400°C, amorphous ZrO2 was transformed into tetragonal phase of ZrO2 (t-ZrO2). At 450°C, t-ZrO2 and monoclinic phase of ZrO2 (m-ZrO2) were obtained. By altering heating rate during annealing, volume fraction of t-ZrO2 and m-ZrO2 was changed. FESEM images showed that disordered mesostructures of ZrO2 were formed after annealing.

A novel foam-like silane modified alumina scaffold coated with nano-hydroxyapatite–poly(ε-caprolactone fumarate) composite layer,"Although alumina scaffolds with biodegradable polymer coating can overcome the limitations of conventional ceramic bone substitutes, the bioactivity potential of these scaffolds needs to be enhanced. In this study, the macroporous alumina scaffolds with the defined pore-channel interconnectivity were successfully prepared by the foam replication method. The average pore size of the scaffolds was in the range 200–900μm with around 82% porosity. The average Young's modulus of alumina scaffolds was 2.8GPa. Coating of nano-hydroxyapatite (nano-HA) in poly(ε-caprolactone fumarate) (PCLF) as a carrier on the surface of alumina scaffold was performed. The nano-HA powder was synthesized successfully by the sol–gel method. The crystallite and particle sizes of HA powders were in nano range and confirmed by the Scherrer equation from X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The PCLF was synthesized and characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In order to make a chemical link between the alumina scaffolds and the coating, a silane coupling agent was used. The results showed that using of 1g Methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane in 100g solvent is sufficient for making a thin interface layer between the scaffold and the polymer. The coating process was performed by immersion of scaffolds in the solutions with different percents of nano-HA. The morphology and chemical structure of the coated scaffolds were investigated by SEM and FTIR. SEM images demonstrated that the scaffolds were constituted of interconnected and homogeneously distributed pores. Also, HA distribution and agglomerates on the surface of scaffolds were enhanced by increasing the nano-HA percent in the coating solutions.","Joughehdoust, Sedigheh;Behnamghader, Aliasghar;Imani, Mohammad;Daliri, Morteza;Doulabi, Azadehsadat Hashemi;Jabbari, Ebrahim",2013-01-31,Ceramics International,"B.

Sintering characteristics of plasma-sprayed TBCs: Experimental analysis and an overall modelling,"In this study, sintering behaviour of plasma-sprayed thermal barrier coatings (PS-TBCs) was investigated experimentally and theoretically. Results show that the sintering kinetics of PS-TBCs is highly stage-sensitive. The sintering proceeds significantly faster at initial short thermal exposure (<20h), while it slows down dramatically at following long thermal exposure. A detailed examination on microstructural evolution of the PS-TBCs was carried out to understand their sintering behaviour. Results show that, different from the conventional sintering theory, the healing of 2D pores was dominantly responsible for the stage-sensitive sintering kinetics during thermal exposure. In brief, the sintering characteristics of the PS-TBCs are highly structure specific. In addition, a structural model was developed based on the structural characteristics of the PS-TBCs; and the model predicts a well consistent sintering behaviour with experiments. Finally, an outlook towards TBCs with higher performance was put forward.","Li, Guang-Rong;Yang, Guan-Jun;Li, Cheng-Xin;Li, Chang-Jiu",2018-02-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs),Plasma spray,Sintering,Stage-sensitive kinetics,Structural tailoring",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.052,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.052
Study on process and performance of thermal protective coating on polyimide resin matrix composite,"In order to expand the application of polyimide resin matrix composites in the hot stage components of aeroengine, YSZ-based thermal protective composite coating was prepared on the surface of polyimide-based composites by detonation gun spraying. Sandblasting, sandpaper polishing and laser ablation were used to improve the surface roughness of the composites matrix. Bond bottom layer (Al, Cu, Zn), NiCoCrAl intermediate transition layer and YSZ top layer were matching with different thickness. The cross-section structure of the composite coating observed by SEM shows that the composite coatings of 0.1 mm Al bottom layer, 0.1 mm NiCoCrAl transition layer and 0.3 mm YSZ top layer are the best thickness matching for thermal protection of polyimide-based composite materials. There is no thermal damage to the surface and interior of the substrate during the preparation of the coating. The cross-section structure of the coating is uniform, and the interface between the layers is closely bonded and no micro-damage, Cracks and holes appear. After sandblasting, the bonding strength of the coating is 16.5 MPa by lattice laser texture treatment. The structure and thermal insulation properties of the composite coating are the best at 800 °C. The thermal conductivity is 1.46 W/(m·K), the specific heat capacity is 0.58 J/(g·K), and the thermal expansion coefficient is 7.89 × 10-6/K.","Haoliang, Tian;Changliang, Wang;Mengqiu, Guo;Yongjing, Cui;Junguo, Gao;Zhihui, Tang;Yi, Liang;Cong, Song;Hao, Wang;Guo, Jin;Shicheng, Wei",2020-06-01,Ceramics International,"Polyimide composites,Detonation gun spraying,YSZ composite coating,Bonding strength,Thermal insulation performance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.043,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.043
"Characteristic, cell response and apatite-induction ability of microarc oxidized TiO2-based coating containing P on Ti6Al4V before and after chemical-treatment and dehydration","The structure, cell response and induction capability for apatite formation of the microarc oxidized (MAO) coating before and after chemical-treatment and subsequent dehydration at 400°C were investigated. The surfaces of the chemically treated MAO (C-MAO) coatings before and after dehydration showed ribbon-like amorphous phase mainly containing Na, Ti and O elements with network morphology. Subsequent dehydration has no pronounced effect on the surface roughness, wetting ability, surface constituents and chemical state of Ti, Na and O of the C-MAO coating. The outer layers of the C-MAO coating before and after dehydration showed Na, Ti and O elements with uniform distributions along the surface depth. Chemical-treatment improves the apatite-forming ability of the MAO coating; however, subsequent dehydration greatly lowers that of the C-MAO coating, since it changed the ability of C-MAO coating to release Na+ ions, which is unfavorable for the formation of Ti-OH groups. The apatite formed on the two coatings contained HPO4 2− and CO3 2− ions. In addition, the dehydration of the C-MAO coating seemed to be unsuitable for the cell proliferation on its surface.","Wei, Daqing;Zhou, Yu;Yang, Chunhui",2009-09-30,Ceramics International,"Coating,Titanium alloy,Microarc oxidation,Biomimetic apatite,Dehydration,MG63 cell",10.1016/j.ceramint.2008.12.014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2008.12.014

Meanwhile, conventional t-8YSZ feedstocks were also selected for comparison. The thermo-physical properties of both coatings have been studied. Results indicate that nanostructured 8YSZ coatings have a lower thermal conductivity than conventional counterparts especially when the temperature is above 1000 °C.

"Optically controlled polarization, photovoltaic and switchable diode behavior in multifunctional KBiFe2O5 composite film","This paper presents a light-induced diode effect in connection with the polarization direction and enhanced remanent polarization in polymer composite of the well-known multiferroic KBiFe2O5 film. Composite films of KBiFe2O5 with different PVA ratios were prepared by spin coating of ceramic slurry and the best composition with PVA was selected on the basis of its suitability for visible light absorption. KBiFe2O5-PVA composite film showed enhanced photovoltaic response under visible-light exposure with open circuit voltage of 2.11 V, photocurrent density of −8.3 × 10−5 A/cm2 and efficiency of 0.076%. The observed diode-like behavior in the composite film switched its direction with the flipping of electric polarization by an external voltage. The enhanced ferroelectric properties in the film were due to the reduction in leakage owing to the presence of non-conductive polymer in it. The composite film exhibited a piezoelectric coefficient of 1.98 nm/V and 2.2 nm/V corresponding to 15 V and −15 V respectively.","Jalaja, M.A.;Dutta, Soma",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"KBiFe2O5,Magnetic,Piezoelectric,Photoferroelectric,Bandgap,Photovoltaic",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.283,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.283
"Spray power-governed microstructure and composition, and their effects on properties of lanthanum-cerium-tantalum-oxide thermal barrier coating","Lanthanum-cerium-tantalum-oxide (LCT) thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) were prepared by air plasma spraying at three different spray powers. Then, the effects of spray power on the microstructure, composition, thermophysical properties, mechanical performances, and thermal cycling behaviors of the coatings were investigated in detail. The results indicated that when the spray power was increased from 30 kW to 42 kW in 6 kW steps, the coating became denser, the La/(Ce + Ta) ratio of the as-sprayed coating first increased slowly and then sharply, and the thermal conductivity and thermal expansion coefficient of the coating gradually increased and decreased, respectively. In addition, the Vickers hardness, Young's modulus, and fracture toughness of the coating first increased and then decreased. The spray power had a significant impact on the thermal cycling performance of LCT coating. The LCT coating prepared at low power showed better thermal shock resistance. The thermal expansion mismatch stress and the low fracture toughness of a ceramic top coat are the main reasons for the premature failure of the TBCs.","Zhang, Hao;Zeng, Jinyan;Yuan, Jieyan;Liang, Panpan;Zhou, Xin;Chen, Si;Duo, Shuwang;Dong, Shujuan;Jiang, Jianing;Deng, Longhui;Cao, Xueqiang",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,Plasma spray power,Porosity,Thermal expansion,Fracture toughness,Thermal shock resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.132,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.132
Effects of microstructure evolution on the oxidation behavior and high-temperature tribological properties of AlCrN/TiAlSiN multilayer coatings,"AlCrN/TiAlSiN multilayer coatings have drown great attentions due to they combine both high hardness of TiAlSiN coating and outstanding oxidation resistance of AlCrN coating. In this study, AlCrN, TiAlSiN, and AlCrN/TiAlSiN multilayered coatings with two different multilayer designs: AlCrN/TiAlSiN-1 coating with fixed modulation period and ratio and AlCrN/TiAlSiN-2 coating with gradient increased AlCrN sub-layer thickness, were synthesized. The microstructure, mechanical property, thermal stability, oxidation behavior, and tribological performance of these coatings were comparably investigated. The variation of structure effects on the properties of the coatings were also discussed. The results indicated that the AlCrN/TiAlSiN multilayered coatings had superior performance than the monolayer AlCrN and TiAlSiN coatings. The AlCrN/TiAlSiN-2 coating also showed better thermal stability, oxidation resistance and high-temperature tribological properties compared to AlCrN/TiAlSiN-1 coatings, which can be attributed to the formation of a denser Al2O3 oxide layer on the surface of the coating.","Xiao, Baijun;Liu, Jie;Liu, Fan;Zhong, Xing;Xiao, Xiaolan;Zhang, Teng Fei;Wang, Qimin",2018-12-15,Ceramics International,"AlCrN/TiAlSiN multilayer,Thermogravimetric analysis,Oxidation resistance,High-temperature tribological property",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.125,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.125
Molten salt corrosion of high density graphite and partially stabilized zirconia coated high density graphite in molten LiCl–KCl salt,"Corrosion studies were performed on uncoated high density graphite and plasma sprayed partially stabilized zirconia (PSZ) coated high density graphite with NiCrAlY bond coat in molten LiCl–KCl eutectic salt at 600°C for periods of 250h, 1000h and 2000h under inert argon atmosphere. High density graphite showed weight loss while PSZ coated high density graphite showed weight gain. There is no significant attack and degradation of top PSZ coating in molten salt, however microcracks were observed at the bond coat-substrate interface after 2000h of exposure. PSZ coated high density graphite exhibited excellent corrosion resistance in molten LiCl–KCl salt due to chemical stability and absence of phase transformation as confirmed from scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and laser Raman studies, however adhesion of the coating has to be improved.","Sure, Jagadeesh;Ravi Shankar, A.;Ramya, S.;Kamachi Mudali, U.",2012-05-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Synthesis of WC composite powder with nano-cobalt coatings and its application in WC-4Co cemented carbide,"Composite powder of tungsten carbide with nano-cobalt coatings was successful manufactured via a novel sol-gel process, and coarse grained WC-4 wt% Co cemented carbide was produced from the cobalt-coated WC powder. Phase composition and microstructure evaluation were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results revealed that the WC particles were completely encased in the CoC2O4 layers by the sol-gel process. Core-shell structured WC-4 wt% Co composite powder was subsequently prepared by reducing the WC-CoC2O4 precursor powder in hydrogen atmosphere. The morphology and crystal structure of the cobalt-coating were found to depend on the reduction temperature. Chemical analyses revealed that the WC-Co composite powders were non-contaminated and composition-controllable. WC-4 wt% Co cemented carbide fabricated from the cobalt-coated WC composite powder showed a refined and uniform microstructure, and therefore improved mechanical properties, compared to the cemented carbide made by ball-milled WC-Co powder. The transverse rupture strength was 2249 MPa in the cemented carbide from the cobalt-coated WC powder, compared to 1871 MPa of the carbide made by the ball-milling powder.","He, Rengui;Wang, Jianying;He, Meng;Yang, Hailin;Ruan, Jianming",2018-06-15,Ceramics International,"Coarse-grained cemented carbide,WC-Co composite powder,Sol-gel,Hydrogen reduction",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.174,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.174
Thermal and mechanical properties of nano-YSZ–Alumina functionally graded coatings deposited by nano-agglomerated powder plasma spraying,"YSZ, layered YSZ–Alumina and functionally graded YSZ–Alumina TBC coatings were deposited by atmospheric plasma spraying using nano-agglomerated powder. FE-SEM images of coatings showed formation of nanostructure. The thickness of TGO for layered YSZ–Alumina and FG YSZ–Alumina coatings was lower than that found in the case of YSZ coating. This demonstrates the beneficial effect of Alumina as a diffusion barrier for oxygen during high temperature exposure. In layered YSZ–Alumina coatings because of difference in thermal expansion coefficients of YSZ and Alumina and stresses developed at the interface, the tensile strength and thermal shock resistance are lower than FG coatings and Failure of coatings occurred at YSZ–Alumina interface. In FG coatings distribution of stresses in the graded layers provided higher tensile strength and thermal shock resistance and also higher resistance to spallation in oxidation test which is caused by TGO growth.","Saremi, M.;Valefi, Z.",2014-09-30,Ceramics International,"TBC,Functionally graded,YSZ–Alumina,Nano-agglomerated powder",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.05.068,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.05.068
Electrochemical corrosion behavior of carbon steel pipes coated with a protective ceramic layer using plasma and HVOF thermal spray techniques for oil and gas,"Ceramic composite Cr3C2–25%NiCr with high corrosion resistivity (up to 900°C) is applied on carbon steel (SC45) pipes by two different thermal spray-coating techniques: HVOF and Plasma. These techniques can create dense and homogenously deposited layers without affecting the materials’ properties. The corrosion behavior of coated samples is investigated in crude oil solution at 60°C and 3.5% NaCl solution at 30°C for 30 days. Potentiodynamic polarization and EIS results show that the HVOF-coated samples exhibit better corrosion resistance than the plasma-coated samples. However, both coating techniques protect carbon steel from a corrosive environment. XRD and FESEM of the coated samples demonstrate that the solution could not reach the substrate.","Akhtari Zavareh, Mitra;Mohammed Sarhan, Ahmed Aly Diaa;Akhtari Zavareh, Parisa;Basirun, Wan Jeffrey",2016-02-01,Ceramics International,"Cr3C2-25%NiCr,Plasma coating technique,High velocity oxygen fuel,Potentiodynamic polarization,Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.10.134,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.10.134

The coatings were deposited on soda-lime glass substrates to evaluate their homogeneity and critical thickness. Crack-free coatings were obtained at withdrawal rates below 16cm/min with a critical thickness of 80nm.

Investigation on performances of Li1.2Co0.4Mn0.4O2 prepared by self-combustion reaction as stable cathode for lithium-ion batteries,"Poor rate capability and cycling performance are the major barriers for Li-rich layered cathode materials to be applied as the next generation cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries. In our work, Li1.2Co0.4Mn0.4O2 has been successfully synthesized via a self-combustion reaction (SCR) and a calcination procedure. Compared with the material produced by the solid state method (SSM), the one by SCR exhibits both better rate capability and cycling performance. Its initial discharge capacity is 166.01mAhg−1 with the capacity retention of 85.98% after 50 cycles at a current density of 200mAhg−1. Its remarkable performance is attributed to a thin carbon coating layer, which not only slows down the transformation rate of layered to spinel structure, but provides a good electronic pathway to increase the Li+ diffusion coefficient.","Wang, Lei;Wang, Zhen-Bo;Yu, Fu-Da;Liu, Bao-Sheng;Zhang, Yin;Zhou, Yu-Xiang",2016-10-31,Ceramics International,"Li-rich layered cathode materials,Li1.2Co0.4Mn0.4O2,Self-combustion reaction,Carbon coating layer",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.115,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.115
Preparing SiC/diamond coatings via chemical vapor deposition of SiC on diamond-coated graphite and their frictional properties,"SiC/diamond coatings with excellent frictional properties were successfully prepared using graphite as substrate. Diamond particles with size of 25–38μm were firstly bonded on graphite substrate through PVA glue, followed by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of SiC with varied MTS flow on the diamond-coated graphite substrate to enhance the adhesion of diamond particles. The influence of the MTS flow on the SiC coatings was investigated. The results showed that polycrystalline SiC coating with good crystallinity has been obtained. With MTS flow increasing, the SiC grains feature increased surface roughness and greater sizes of the SiC crystallite resulting from the co-deposition of SiC and carbon with increased carbon containing species. Reciprocating sliding wear tests were conducted to investigate the coefficient of friction. With increasing applied load, while the low-flow specimens showed a remarkable increase in the friction coefficient resulting from degradation of the SiC coatings, the high-flow specimens maintained a relatively low friction coefficient during wear tests indicating strong holding force to diamond particles of the SiC coatings. The reason for low friction coefficient of the high-flow specimens was that GCr15 steel ball was wearing by the SiC/diamond coatings with good affinity to the substrate resulting in a flat–flat contact on the contact area.","Yu, Shengjie;Chen, Zhaofeng;Wang, Yang;Luo, Ruiying;Wang, Jiufeng",2016-02-15,Ceramics International,"B.

Fabrication and property of novel double-layer coating deposited on polyimide matrix composites by atmospheric plasma spraying,"Thermal shock resistance of double-layer Al/Nd2Zr2O7 coating plasma-sprayed on the polymer substrate was optimized and its oxidation resistant property was evaluated. During thermal shock test at 723K, thermal cycling lifetime of coating was prolonged by decreasing Al layer thickness or increasing Nd2Zr2O7 layer thickness. Relatively, the A45N225 coating with 45µm Al layer and 225µm Nd2Zr2O7 layer exhibited the best thermal shock resistance. Based on the microstructure evolution, coating failure was mainly attributed to the appearance of delamination at the substrate/Al interface or the formation of microcracks in the coating, resulted from stress accumulation and substrate oxidation during thermal cycling. After oxidation at 723K for 22h, with the protection of A45N225 double-layer coating, the weight loss of specimen reduced from 33.96wt% to 5.31wt%, and the corresponding weight loss per unit decreased from 90.58mgcm−2 to 15.47mgcm−2. However, at the later stage of oxidation, heat transfer and oxygen diffusion through the micro-defects of coating might lead to the oxidation of part resins.","Huang, Wenzhi;Gan, Xiayun;Zhu, Ling",2018-04-01,Ceramics International,"Air plasma spray,Nd2Zr2O7,Thermal shock resistance,Oxidation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.181,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.181
Effect of bentonite addition on fabrication of reticulated porous SiC ceramics for liquid metal infiltration,"SiC with different particles and a clay mineral bentonite (montmorillonite) were mixed in water to prepare ceramic slurry. The slurry was then infiltrated high porous polyurethane sponge. Excess slurry was squeezed out to adjust ceramic rate in the infiltrated body. The pore walls were coated with ceramic mix after the infiltrated body was dried. The polyurethane containing SiC particles and bentonite was fired in a box furnace to burn out the polyurethane from the body at 500°C for 30min. The remaining porous ceramic bodies were sintered at elevated temperatures to give strength. SiC particles with bentonite surface coating took polyurethane pore forms after firing the sponge. Bentonite was both used as binder for ceramic slurry at room temperatures and the sintering additives at elevated temperatures. Therefore, increasing bentonite addition gives higher strength to the resulting ceramic performs.","Soy, Ugur;Demir, Adem;Caliskan, Fatih",2011-01-31,Ceramics International,"B. Porosity,B.

Microstructural-property correlation of CVI processed Cf/SiC composites and property enhancement as a function of CVD SiC seal coating,"Carbon fiber reinforced silicon carbide composites were prepared by an isothermal chemical vapour infiltration (ICVI) process. The test samples were seal coated by SiC by the chemical vapour deposition process. The nature of pyrocarbon coating (as an interphase) was studied before the infiltration of SiC matrix by a CVI process. The effect of protective SiC seal coating was examined by testing the uncoated and the seal coated samples for flexural properties, coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and pore size distribution. The microstructure-property correlation of the flexural test samples showed that the seal coating protected the carbon fibers from oxidation, which resulted in the significant improvement in the flexural strength value at the test temperatures as compared to the uncoated samples. Relatively lesser value of the coefficient of thermal expansion was observed for the seal coated sample.","Singh, Sarabjit;Singh, Vajinder;Kumari, Sweety;Udayakumar, A.;Bhanu Prasad, V.V.",2015-12-31,Ceramics International,"B.

Synergic effect of Ag decoration onto ZnO nanoparticles for the remediation of synthetic dye wastewater,"Highly efficient photocatalytic Ag-decorated ZnO nanopowders were fabricated via photodeposition method. The physical properties of synthesized nanopowders were rigorously investigated using analytical techniques, such as, powder XRD studies, HR-TEM and PL spectroscopy. The surface area of samples was obtained using BET analysis. The potential of synthesized nanopowders as photocatalyst was evaluated by studying the degradation of basonyl violet dye. Coating of ZnO nanopowders with metallic silver resulted in a remarkable improvement in photocatalytic activity. Moreover, most proficient conditions were deduced for the degradation of basonyl violet, by varying parameters, such as, catalyst loading, concentration of dye, and solution pH, using Ag-decorated ZnO nanopowders under UV irradiation.","Kaur, Japinder;Gupta, Kanu;Kumar, Vinod;Bansal, Sandeep;Singhal, Sonal",2016-02-01,Ceramics International,"Ag-decorated ZnO,Photodeposition,Photocatalysis,Basonyl violet",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.10.035,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.10.035

Films coated on flat (alumina plates, fused silica, slide glass) substrates and optical fibers were dense and without defects. The onset of the film crystallization was between 450 and 500 °C and crystallinity increased with increasing processing temperature. Magnetization of ferrite films on optical fibers was nearly reversible in external magnetic field H ext up to about 2.4 kA/m even without preceding AC demagnetization. The magnetization of 255 × 10−3T for Ni0.99Co0.01Fe2O4 films processed at 750 °C for 2 h was observed.

The preparation and characterization of alumina-coated pyrophyllite-diatomite composite support layers,"Porous ceramic membranes are a current research focus because of their outstanding thermal and chemical stabilities. Recent research has utilized inexpensive natural materials such as pyrophyllite and diatomite to reduce the expense of these porous ceramic membranes. However, insufficient data exist for microfiltration applications using pyrophyllite-based membranes. We compared the measured membrane properties of alumina-coated alumina support layers and alumina-coated pyrophyllite-diatomite composite support layers. These experiments were used to determine whether we could effectively reduce the average pore size with acceptable water permeability by controlling the thickness of the alumina coating layer. The membrane properties of the alumina-coated alumina support layers and alumina-coated pyrophyllite-diatomite composite support layers were examined using scanning electron microscopy, mercury porosimetry, and a dead-end microfiltration system.","Ha, Jang-Hoon;Lee, Sujin;Abbas Bukhari, Syed Zaighum;Lee, Jongman;Song, In-Hyuck",2017-01-31,Ceramics International,"Alumina coating layer,Alumina support layer,Pyrophyllite-diatomite composite support layer,Pore characteristics,Microfiltration",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.127,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.127
Sol–gel derived bioglass as a coating material for porous alumina scaffolds,"Bioglasses are important bioactive materials and have been used for the repair and reconstruction of diseased bone tissues, as they exhibit direct bonding with human bone tissues. However, bioglasses have low mechanical properties and thus are usually used as coatings on strong substrates. A sol–gel method was used in this study to produce the 58S bioglass powder with the composition of 58mol% SiO2–38mol% CaO–4mol% P2O5. The bioglass powder was then pressed into discs and sintered at 500, 800, 1000, and 1200°C, respectively. The apparent density and the Vicker’s hardness of the sintered bioglass were tested using a densometer and a Vicker’s hardness tester. The thermal properties of the bioglass were also studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dilatometry. The crystallization of the bioglass was examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The sintered bioglass discs were then immersed in the simulated body fluid (SBF) solution. The bioglass surface after the immersion was examined using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The formation of apatite layer was confirmed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The apparent density and the hardness of the bioglass reached 3.12g/cm3 at 1000°C and 1.05GPa at 1200°C, respectively. The formation of hydroxyl-carbonate apatite layer confirmed the bioactivity of the bioglass. It was also found that at sintering temperatures above 800°C, crystalline phase CaSiO3 was formed. With the formation of CaSiO3, the bioactivity of the bioglass started to decrease.","Liu, Jianli;Miao, Xigeng",2004-12-31,Ceramics International,"Sol–gel,Bioglass,Crystallinity,Bioactivity,Coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2003.12.120,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2003.12.120
Nanoporous tantalum coated zirconia implant improves osseointegration,"Zirconia has become a new dental implant material because of its excellent esthetics, biocompatibility, and minimal ion release. However, biological inertness of zirconia surface results in weak integration with bone tissue in the early stage of osseointegration. To enhance the early osseointegration of zirconia implant, a homogeneous nanoporous tantalum (TaNS) coating (~30 nm in diameter and 1 μm in length) with good adhesion strength was prepared on zirconia surface via magnetron sputtering combined with anodization. The roughness and hydrophilicity in ZrO2/TaNS groups were significantly improved as compared to other groups. The protein adsorption, initial adhesion, spreading and proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells were significantly enhanced in ZrO2/TaNS group as compared to ZrO2 and ZrO2/Ta group. Moreover, the osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells was significantly improved in ZrO2/TaNS groups than other groups by up-regulating the expression of the osteogenic-related genes (RunX2, ALP, COL-1, OSX, OCN and OPG). Histological analysis displayed that more newly regenerated bone was deposited around ZrO2/TaNS group than other groups, and the bone-implant contact in ZrO2/TaNS group was enhanced correspondingly. In conclusion, the TaNS coating with good adhesion strength can be successfully prepared on zirconia surface by magnetron sputtering combined with anodization. This novel coating will be a promising clinical application in improving osseointegration of the zirconia implant.","Wu, Lianjun;Dong, Yiwen;Yao, Litao;Liu, Chuantong;Al-Bishari, Abdullrahman M;Ru Yie, Kendrick Hii;Zhang, Hualin;Liu, Jinsong;Wu, Gang",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"Zirconia,Nanoporous tantalum coating,Magnetron sputtering,Anodization,Osseointegration",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.038,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.038
Synthesis and characterization of neem gum coated superparamagnetic nanoparticle based novel nanobiocomposite,"Uses of biopolymers for the development of nanocarriers are receiving significant attention due to its biocompatible and biodegradable nature. Neem (Azadirachta indica) is a well known medicinal plant and it is reported that the polysaccharides and limonoids present in the neem extract prevent the growth and proliferation of cancer cells. In this work, we have synthesized neem gum (NG) coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) based novel nanobiocomposite (Fe3O4@NG NBC) by simple sonochemical method and characterized it for structural, microstructural and magnetic properties. The morphology, structure, and magnetic properties of the prepared Fe3O4 NPs and Fe3O4@NG nanobiocomposite were investigated by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) analysis. XRD pattern, TEM micrograph and FTIR spectra confirmed the successful coating of neem gum on Fe3O4 nanoparticles. IR spectra of Fe3O4@NG nanobiocomposite revealed the presence of specific bands corresponding to both neem gum and Fe3O4 NPs, which confirmed the formation of Fe3O4@NG NBC. The obtained size of Fe3O4@NG nanobiocomposite particles was ∼50–400 nm. VSM analysis confirmed the superparamagnetic nature of both Fe3O4 NPs and Fe3O4@NG nanobiocomposite. Fe3O4@NG nanobiocomposite was loaded with anticancer drug doxorubicin (Dox) and its release behaviour was studied at pH 7.4 and 5. Faster release of Dox was observed in acidic environment. In vitro cytotoxicity of the prepared Fe3O4@NG NBC against human monocytic cell line THP‐1 was also studied by MTT assay. This novel Fe3O4@NG nanobiocomposite with low toxicity, biodegradability, water dispersability, excellent drug loading ability and good magnetic controllability could offer potential applications in biomedical field including targeted drug delivery for cancer diagnosis and treatment in near future.","Asghar, Khushnuma;Qasim, Mohd;Das, Dibakar",2019-12-15,Ceramics International,"Nanobiocomposite,Magnetic properties,Ferrites,Biomedical applications",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.050,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.050
Experimental study on tribological properties of Cu–Al2O3 nanocomposite hybridized by graphene nanoplatelets,"Mechanical and tribological properties of Cu–Al2O3 nanocomposite hybridized by silver (Ag) coated graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) were studied. Four different GNPs content, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9 and 1.2 wt% were considered to highlight its influence on the properties of the produced hybrid nanocomposite. The synthesis of hybrid nanocomposites involves ball milling and hot pressing. Microstructural observations showed homogenous distribution of both Al2O3 and GNPs. The results showed significant hardness improvement with increasing GNPs content reaching 55.2% compared to the pure Cu due to the grain refinement, high strength of GNPs and the reinforcing of grain boundaries by the precipitation of GNPs. Moreover, the wear resistance is increased while the coefficient of friction is decreased by increasing GNPs content. Among the all manufactured samples, Cu-10 wt% Al2O3 +1.2 wt% GNPs shows the highest mechanical and the wear resistance. Additionally, it shows the lowest coefficient of friction highlighting its importance for tribological applications.","Sadoun, A.M.;Fathy, A.",2019-12-15,Ceramics International,"Copper hybrid nanocomposites,Electro-less coating,Hardness,Wear and friction",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.220,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.220
Electrophoretic deposition of titania nanostructured coatings with different porous patterns,"Titania nanostructured coatings with different porous patterns were fabricated by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) in isopropanolic suspension including different concentrations of carbon active (CA) or carbon black (CB) particles as the porogen additives. Finer and negatively charged CA particles were electrostatically adsorbed on the coarser and positively charged titania particles and formed CA-titania particles. While, finer and positively charged titania particles were electrostatically adsorbed on the coarser and negatively charged CB particles to form titania-CB particles. Both CA-titania and titania-CB particles had the net positive surface charge and so cathodic EPD was applicable. EPD was carried out at optimized conditions of 60 V and 10 s. Thermogravimetry (TG) analysis showed that CA and CB burn out between 450 °C and 600 °C. The higher the carbon content in the suspension the higher was their content in the coating. The coatings were characterized by SEM, AFM, adhesion strength and bioactivity tests. Even coatings with interconnected fine pores and low roughnesses were obtained after the heat treatment of CA-titania coatings.

Microstructure evolution and wear resistance of nitride/aluminide coatings on the surface of Ti-coated 2024 Al alloy during plasma nitriding,"A duplex surface treatment consisting in depositing a Ti film followed by plasma nitriding was adopted to improve the wear resistance of 2024 Al alloys. Nano-grained Ti films were firstly deposited on the substrate surface by using magnetron sputtering, then plasma nitrided for 8h at 400°C, 430°C, 460°C and 490°C, in a gas mixture of 40% N2+60% H2. Duplex coatings composed of three sublayers (i.e. the outmost TiN0.3 layer, the intermediate Al3Ti layer and the inside Al18Ti2Mg3 layer) were obtained at nitriding temperature higher than 460°C. The coatings obtained at 400°C and 430°C consisted of mainly α-TiN0.3 with (002) preferred orientation. The surface hardness of the coatings increased at higher nitriding temperature, reaching the maximum of 500 HV at 490°C, which was about 8 times higher than that of the uncoated alloy. The friction coefficients of 2024 Al alloy decreased in the coatings prepared at higher nitriding temperature, reaching the lowest values of 0.31 at 490°C. The wear rate of the coated samples decreased by 56% compared with the uncoated ones. The analysis of worn surface indicated that the nitrided samples exhibited severe adhesive wear at 400°C that changed to predominant abrasive wear at increased nitriding temperature.","Zhang, Fanyong;Yan, Mufu;He, Jining;Yin, Fuxing",2017-10-01,Ceramics International,"Duplex treatment,TiN0.3,Plasma nitriding,Aluminide,Wear resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.109,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.109
Behavior and mechanism of the stress buffer effect of the inside ceramic layer to the top ceramic layer in a double-ceramic-layer thermal barrier coating,"The Double-Ceramic-Layer Thermal Barrier Coating (DCL-TBC) consists of a top ceramic layer (TC1), an inside ceramic layer (TC2), bond coat (BC) and alloy substrate. The top ceramic layer is made by new ceramic materials which has the lower thermal conductivity, such as LZ, LZ7C3, LMA etc. Although these materials have good high temperature performance and thermal insulation properties, their thermal expansion coefficients are very low which cause higher degree of mismatch with material properties of alloy substrate. The behavior of the stress buffer effect of the layer of TC2 is investigated aiming at the DCL-TBC with the two ceramic layers as LZ7C3(TC1) and 8YSZ(TC2). A FE model of the DCL-TBC is established and the stress of the TC1 during the thermal cycles is calculated. Results show that the layer of TC2 has the behaviors of stress buffer effect on reducing the stress of TC1 and reducing the influence of the TGO growth upon the stress of TC1. The inner mechanism of the stress buffer effect is investigated based on the influence of the thermal expansion coefficient ρ of the TC2 layer. Results show that the TC1 layer varies with the TC2 layer, having different thermal expansion coefficients; and the stress buffer effect is dominant, affected by the thermal expansion coefficients of the TC2 layer. The thermal expansion coefficient should be neither too large nor too low; if its values are too low or too large, the stress levels of TC1 are all high. The reasonable range of the thermal expansion coefficient is investigated. Aiming at the DCL-TBC with the two ceramic layer thicknesses as 150μm, the reasonable range of the thermal expansion coefficient of TC2 is from 10.35°C−1 (×10−6) to 10.887°C−1 (×10−6).","Han, Meng;Huang, Jihua;Chen, Shuhai",2014-03-31,Ceramics International,"The DCL-TBC,The stress buffer effect,FE numerical simulation,The reasonable range of the thermal expansion coefficient",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.10.021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.10.021
"Fabrication of porcelain foam substrates coated with SiC, Ni, and Cr using the dip-coating technique","This report presents a study on the properties of porcelain foam substrate fabricated via the sponge replication technique. The sintered porcelain foam substrates were dip-coated with SiC-, Cr-, and Ni-based coating slurries, and sintered again at 900–1250°C. The XRD results of coated samples show existence of secondary phases (Cr2O3, Al3Cr7, NiO2, and NiAl2O4) due to sintering, mostly at higher temperatures. The porosity of the plain substrate was reduced significantly after dip-coating and proportionally decreased as the sintering temperature increased, therefore influencing the compressive strength value. Furthermore, the thermal conductivity of coated substrate sintered at 1250°C was obtained in the range of 0.0921–0.1358W/mK, when compared to the plain substrate at 0.0461W/mK. In general, a reduction in the number of pores, cracks and open cells was observed, with significant improvement in the compressive strength of the coated substrate.","Jamaludin, Abdul Rashid;Kasim, Shah Rizal;Ismail, Ahmad Kamal;Abdullah, Mohd Zukifly;Ahmad, Zainal Arifin",2015-03-31,Ceramics International,"Sintering,Porosity,Thermal conductivity,Fracture,Porcelain",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.10.123,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.10.123
Enhanced dielectric properties of homogeneous Ti3C2Tx MXene@SiO2/polyvinyl alcohol composite films,"Exploring flexible dielectrics with high dielectric constant and low loss is pertinent for many applications in electronic devices. In the present work, a non-ferroelectric polymer, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), was used to fabricate homogeneous dielectric composite films with a relatively high dielectric constant and a low dielectric loss by using 2D nano sheets (Ti3C2Tx MXene) as the filler. To limit dielectric loss, SiO2 was coated onto the surface of MXene to provide interfacial barrier effect and suppress dielectric loss. MXene@SiO2/PVA composite films showed lower dielectric losses at low frequencies (from 20 Hz to ~ 10 kHz) compared with MXene/PVA composite films. MXene@SiO2/PVA composite films with 2.5 wt% MXene loading and 5 wt% (with respect to MXene content) SiO2 coating had a dielectric constant of 27.2 (a 292.5% rise compared to neat PVA film) and a dielectric loss of only 0.057 (a 259.6% reduction compared to MXene/PVA composite film) at 100 Hz and room temperature (RT). In addition, this SiO2-coated composite film had stable dielectric properties (dielectric constant and loss change from 27.2 to 29.3 and 0.057 to 0.104, respectively) in the temperature range of RT to 60 °C. This work provides a promising way to fabricate PVA-based dielectric composites with excellent dielectric properties for practical applications in electronics.","Wan, Wei;Tao, Meizhen;Cao, Hailin;Zhao, Yuqing;Luo, Junrong;Yang, Jian;Qiu, Tai",2020-06-15,Ceramics International,"Polyvinyl alcohol,Ti3C2Tx MXene,Composite films,Dielectric properties,SiO2",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.179,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.179
Preparation of porous ceramic membrane for gas-solid separation,"Membranes for gas-solid separation were prepared by using short fibres as starting materials. A suitable viscosity and solid content for the coating suspension were determined to be 66–75 mPa·s and 10–12.5%, respectively. The observation by scanning electron microscopy shows that the short fibres cover the entire surface of the support uniformly. The filter resistance and the value of the fine particulate matter (VFPM2.5) were studied. The baseline filter resistance of the membrane (288.1 Pa) was lower than that of the membrane prepared by using alumina powder (366 Pa). The value of the fine particulate matter (VFPM2.5) was 60 μg/m3, which meets the emission standard of GB3095-2012 (35–75 μg/m3). These results demonstrated that the membrane prepared with short fibres shows higher filter efficiency and better regeneration performance.","Song, Xinying;Jian, Binhua;Jin, Jiang",2018-11-30,Ceramics International,"Porous ceramic membrane,Short fibres,Ceramic powder,Gas-solid separation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.026,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.026
The effect of SiC addition on the crystallization kinetics of atmospheric plasma–sprayed basalt-based coatings,"The crystallisation kinetics of the conversion of a glass coating layer made from a mixture of natural basalt volcanic rock and SiC into glass-ceramic have been investigated. The process depends on the crystallisation temperature, time and amount of the SiC added. Coating powders were prepared from pure basalt and from basalt containing 10–50wt% SiC. The powders were coated by an atmospheric plasma spray technique on the pre-coated AISI 1040 steel substrate with Ni–Al. The coating layer was vitrified by sudden cooling. The amorphous structure of the coatings was verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. To obtain glass-ceramic, coatings were subjected to crystallisation heat treatment in an argon atmosphere. Crystallisation heat treatment temperatures of 800°C, 900°C and 1000°C were chosen by using DTA. After the heat treatment process, augite, ferrian-diopsite, diopside, albite, andesine, and moissonite phases formed in the coating layer and were verified by XRD analysis. The crystallisation activation energies were determined to be between 323.4kJ/mol and 253.2kJ/mol, depending on SiC addition. The crystallisation activation energies decreased with increasing amounts of SiC addition. The Avrami parameters of the crystallisation process varied between 1.60 and 3.33, which indicates that internal crystallisation dominated for all of the compositions.","Ercenk, Ediz;Sen, Ugur;Yilmaz, Senol",2012-12-31,Ceramics International,"D: Glass-ceramic,D.

Effect of cobalt content on high-temperature tribological properties of TiC-Co coatings,"Titanium carbide based cermets are promising wear resistant coating materials used at elevated temperatures in hostile environment owing to their excellent mechanical, physical and chemical properties. In this work, TiC-Co composite coatings with different Co content, as well as a WC-17Co reference coating are prepared by plasma spraying and their wear resistances are investigated. The friction coefficients and wear rates tested by dry sliding friction at 600 °C are used to characterize the high-temperature wear resistance of the coatings. The phase and microstructure evolution of the coatings before and after friction test are evaluated to conclude the wear mechanisms of these coatings. The results show that as-prepared TiC-Co composite coatings are composed of TiC, Ti, α-Co, r-TiO2 and CoO phases and Ti oxidizes to r-TiO2 phase during friction test, which is resulted from decarburization and oxidation of TiC. Among all the coatings, TiC-15Co has the minimum friction coefficient and lowest wear rate. It is contributed to the balanced ratio and good bonding between Co-rich soft phases and Ti-rich hard phases. The wear mechanisms of TiC-Co composite coatings are abrasive wear for low Co content (<15 wt%) coatings and adhesion/fatigue wear for high Co content ones.","Du, Yaxiong;Chen, Hongfei;Yang, Guang;Liu, Bin;Gao, Yanfeng;Luo, Hongjie",2018-08-15,Ceramics International,"TiC-Co composite coatings,High-temperature wear resistance,Plasma spraying,Wear mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.021
Wear behaviors of TiN/TiCN/DLC composite coatings in different environments,"Diamond like carbon (DLC) coatings have high wear resistance and low coefficient of friction and its features are being tried to be further developed. We deposited TiN/TiCN/DLC composite coatings on inconel substrates with closed field unbalanced magnetron sputtering system to improve the features of the conventional DLC coatings. Structural, chemical and bond types of the coating were obtained with the XRD, SEM, EDS and XPS analyses. Wear behaviors of the coatings were determined in atmosphere, distillated water and commercial oil conditions under low (2N) and high (10N) constant load values with using pin-on-disc tribo-test system. The wear results demonstrated that using the TiN/TiCN layers with the DLC coatings increased the load carrying capacity, decreased the CoF, and wear rates at the high load values.","Cicek, Hikmet",2018-04-01,Ceramics International,"PVD,DLC,Wear,Coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.074,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.074
Microstructure and thermal shock resistance of AlBOw- and BNw-whisker-modified thermal barrier coatings,"To improve the crack propagation resistance of YSZ thermal barrier coatings during the thermal cycle, three kinds of thermal barrier coatings were prepared by atmospheric plasma spraying: YSZ, AlBOw-modified YSZ and BNW-modified YSZ. SEM, EDS and XRD were used to analyse the morphology, composition and phase composition of the sprayed powder and coating section. The phase structures of the YSZ, YSZ+AlBOw and YSZ+BNw coatings were t' phase. The cross-section of the coating presents a layered structure with pores inside. The porosity values of the YSZ, YSZ+AlBOw and YSZ+BNw coatings are 10.33%, 14.17% and 12.52%, respectively. The thermal shock resistance of three groups of coatings after 5 min at 1000 °C was analysed. The failure behaviour of the coatings after several thermal cycles was studied. The results show that the thermal shock resistance of the coatings with AlBOw is slightly lower than that of the YSZ coatings. The thermal shock resistance of the BNw coatings is 62.2% higher than that of the YSZ coatings. The whisker inhibits the crack propagation and prolongs the life of the coatings via crack deflection, whisker pull-out and whisker bridging.","Changliang, Wang;Haoliang, Tian;Mengqiu, Guo;Junguo, Gao;Yongjing, Cui;Yi, Liang;Hui, Tong;Yongchao, Fang;Xin, Wen;Hao, Wang",2020-07-31,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,Whisker modification,Porosity,Thermal shock performance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.196,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.196
Oxidation protection and mechanism of the HfB2-SiC-Si/SiC coatings modified by in-situ strengthening of SiC whiskers for C/C composites,"To improve the oxidation resistance and alleviate the thermal stress of the HfB2-SiC-Si/SiC coatings for C/C composites, in-situ formed SiC whiskers (SiCw) were introduced into the HfB2-SiC-Si/SiC coatings via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Effects of SiCw on isothermal oxidation and thermal shock resistance for the HfB2-SiC-Si/SiC coatings were investigated. Results showed that the SiCw-HfB2-SiC-Si/SiC coatings exhibited excellent oxidation resistance for C/C composites with only 0.88% weight loss after oxidation for 468 h at 1500 °C, which was markedly superior to 4.86% weight loss for coatings without SiCw. Meanwhile, after 50 times thermal cycling, the weight loss of the SiCw-HfB2-SiC-Si/SiC coated samples was 4.48%, which showed an obvious decrease compared with that of the HfB2-SiC-Si/SiC coated samples. The SiCw-HfB2-SiC-Si/SiC coatings exhibited excellent adhesion to the C/C substrate and had no penetrating cracks after oxidation. The improved performance of the SiCw-HfB2-SiC-Si/SiC coatings could be ascribed to the SiCw, which effectively relieved CTE mismatch and remarkably suppressed the cracks through toughening mechanisms including whiskers pull-out and bridging strengthening. The above results were confirmed by thermal analysis based on the finite element method, which demonstrated that SiCw could effectively alleviate thermal stress generated by temperature variation. Furthermore, the SiCw-HfB2-SiC-Si/SiC coating can provide a promising fail-safe mechanism during the high temperature oxidation by the formation of HfSiO4 and SiO2, which can deflect cracks and heal imperfections.","Wang, Tianying;Luo, Ruiying",2018-08-01,Ceramics International,"Carbon/carbon composites,SiC whisker,HfB2-SiC-Si,Oxidation resistance,Thermal shock resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.025
A facile strategy for recovering spent LiFePO4 and LiMn2O4 cathode materials to produce high performance LiMnxFe1-xPO4/C cathode materials,"To successfully recycle spent LiFePO4 and LiMn2O4 batteries and simultaneously produce high performances nano-LiMnxFe1-xPO4/C powders, a mechanical activation-assisted method was effectively applied in the recycling process. The technique consists of the separation and purification of spent cathode materials, high-energy mechanical mixing of raw materials and a commonly used heat treatment processes. The structural and morphological characterization results indicate that nano-sized LiMnxFe1-xPO4/C composites with uniform amorphous carbon coatings were successfully synthesized from spent LiFePO4 and LiMn2O4 batteries. The electrochemical performance testing results show that the recovered nano-LiMnxFe1-xPO4/C cathodes possess promising Li-ion storage properties. LiMn0.5Fe0.5PO4/C displays high capacities of 143.2, 138.1, and 127.6 mAh g−1 at 0.1, 1, and 2C rates, respectively. The obtained cathodes also show outstanding cycling stabilities of 98.47% and 97.58% for LiMn0.5Fe0.5PO4/C and LiMn0.8Fe0.2PO4/C after 100 cycles, respectively.

"Synthesis of mixed ionic and electronic conducting garnet with doping of transition elements (Fe, Co, Ni)","Garnet structure electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) exhibits high ionic conductivity, high fracture toughness, and low strain during cycling. The mechanical stability of cathodes could be improved by an LLZO coating. Nevertheless, the electronic conductivity of LLZO is in the order of 10−9 S cm−1, and therefore the electron conduction of cathodes is blocked by the LLZO coating layer. The electronic conductivity is raised by doping variable valence elements (Fe, Co, Ni) into garnets. The doping has only a weak effect on the ionic conductivity, while the electronic conductivity is increased to 10−6 S cm−1. Co-doped sample exhibits the highest electronic conductivity of 2.75 × 10−6 S cm−1.

Characterizations of P(VDF-HFP)-BaTiO3 nanocomposite films fabricated by a spin-coating process,"In this work, free-standing and flexible polymer-ceramic nanocomposite films were fabricated by a spin-coating process using poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) [P(VDF-HFP)] as matrix and BaTiO3 (BTO) nanoparticles as filler. The relationships between the properties and compositions were systematically investigated. It is experimentally found that the crystallinity and the size of crystals of the P(VDF-HFP) matrix decreases with increasing BTO content. The dielectric responses of the polymer used as matrix were determined by four dielectric processes. Both the temperature and frequency dependences of the dielectric responses obtained in the composite films are mainly determined by the polymer matrix, and the influences of the ceramic filler on the four dielectric processes of the polymer matrix were discussed.","Lu, Xu;Zou, Xiaowan;Shen, Jialiang;Jin, Li;Yan, Fuxue;Zhao, Gaoyang;Zhang, Lin;Cheng, Z.-Y.",2019-10-01,Ceramics International,"Nanocomposite,P(VDF-HFP),BaTiO3,Dielectric,Molecular mobility",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.346,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.346
CaS:Eu2+@CaZnOS:Mn2+: A dual-UV/green-excited and dual-red-emitting spectral conversion with all-weather resistance,"To pursue green ecological agriculture, long-life functionalized green house is looking for solar spectrum conversions with well spectral match, outstanding thermal and chemical stabilities, excellent anti-photobleaching and UV-conversion performance. CaS:Eu2+-based phosphors are widely known as a candidate for agricultural films with remarkable green-to-red conversion performance while they are also notorious for poor stabilities. In this work, a core-shell structured CaS:Eu2+@CaZnOS:Mn2+ composite phosphor was synthesized by a two-step solid state method. The coating layer of thermally and chemically inert oxysulfide prevents the sulfide core phosphor from hydrophilic, air-sensitive and heat-induced decompositions. Moreover, the addition of Mn2+ in CaZnOS shell qualifies the composite phosphor with strong UV absorption, which contributes to the improvement of the anti-photodegradation of the inner CaS:Eu2+ and the anti-aging of practical polymer films. The additional UV-to-orange red conversion resulting from CaZnOS:Mn2+ further extends the red components for the indoor plants. As a result, this dual UV/green excited and dual red-emitting super stable chalcogenide phosphor can be used as a general spectral conversion for plant cultivation.","Wang, Xiaofang;He, Jiali;Qiu, Zhongxian;Mi, Qinghua;Xu, Jing;Ai, Shiyun;Zhou, Wenli;Liu, Yongfu;Lian, Shixun",2020-05-31,Ceramics International,"Solar spectral conversion,Alkaline earth sulfide,Red phosphor,Plant cultivation,Artificial light,Surface coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.242,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.242

Probabilities of cracks developing within the topcoat that can bridge asperities (0.01% at 400 h, 2% at 800 h, and 11% at 1300 h) were determined indicating that CND may be a useful tool for predicting lifetimes of SPS-TBCs.","Xiao, Bingjie;Robertson, Taylor;Huang, Xiao;Kearsey, Rick",2020-02-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,Crack numerical density,Fracture,Gamma statistics",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.258,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.258
Brazing of metallized SiC ceramic to GH99 superalloy using graphene nanoplatelets reinforced AgCuTi composite filler,"A two-step process involving, first, the pre-metallization of the SiC ceramic, followed by the vacuum brazing using graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) reinforced AgCuTi composite filler was developed to join SiC ceramic and GH99 superalloy. The metallization characteristics, joint microstructure and fracture behavior were investigated. Through pre-metallization, a smooth metallic coating formed on the SiC ceramic surface; the carbide layer adjacent to SiC ceramic had a semi-coherent interface with it. Brazing process showed that in situ synthesized TiC particles with fine-grains were evenly dispersed in the filler matrix due to GNPs acting as nucleation sites, promoting the refinement of microstructure of the joint. Moreover, the effect of GNPs in retarding the diffusion of metal atoms limited the reaction of Ti with Cu and Ni, thereby reducing the negative impact induced by the brittle compounds. The maximum shear strength of 26.4 MPa was obtained at AgCuTi-1%GNPs, which was ∼151.4% higher than the joint brazed using AgCuTi filler.","Song, Yanyu;Liu, Duo;Hu, Shengpeng;Song, Xiaoguo;Lei, Yuzhen;Cao, Jian",2019-05-31,Ceramics International,"Graphene nanosplatelets,SiC ceramic,GH99,Metallization,Interfacial microstructure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.227,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.227

The sintered ceramics were investigated in terms of microstructure and dielectric properties. The XRD patterns indicated the formation of perovskite structure in orthorhombic and tetragonal polymorphs which proved the room-temperature polymorphic phase boundary for all the noted compositions. By increasing x from 0 to 0.04, the tetragonal weight fraction (W T ) monotonically increased and was inversely proportional to orthorhombic weight fraction, implying that the weight fractions were approximately the same in both polymorphs with x=0.03. It was observed that the maximum ε r (~1815) and minimum loss factor (0.025) occured for KNN-LST (x=0.03) sample which was ascribed to similar weight fractions of the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases.

A novel electroless plating of Ni–P–Al–ZrO2 nanocomposite coatings and their properties,"The wear performance of electroless deposited Ni–P–Al–ZrO2 nanocomposite coatings on mild steel was studied. Nanosized aluminium–zirconium composites were first prepared by mechanical alloying in a high energy planetary ball mill for different extents of time (5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50h). The 50h milled Al+ZrO2 powder was then used as the second phase (4g/L) for the development of electroless Ni–P–Al–ZrO2 nanocomposite coatings using alkaline bath. The phases, size, morphology of 50h milled Al+ZrO2 nanopowder and Ni–P–Al–ZrO2 nanocomposite coatings were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) respectively. These coatings were heat treated at 400°C for 1h in argon atmosphere. Wear resistance of coatings was measured by the ball on disc method at different loads (1N, 1.5N, 2N) and velocities (0.1, 0.2m/s). Microhardness, wear and friction studies of all heat-treated coatings were investigated and compared with Ni–P coatings. The results show that the Al+ZrO2 nanopowder milled for 50h shows unevenly sphericsl shape with particle size ranges from 30 to 40nm. The microhardness and wear resistance of the nanocomposite coatings are improved as compared to Ni–P coatings.

A broad adsorption band at 3200–3500cm−1 attributed to stretching vibrations of O-H bonds in the absorbed water was observed in fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results show that nano-SiO2 particles facilitate water absorption of STO thin films. The breakdown strength of SrTiO3/nano-SiO2 composite films is increased to about 332MV/m. At the same time, the leakage current of 0.9SrTiO3/0.1SiO2 composite thin films decreases by two orders of magnitude under high electric field. Above results show that nano-SiO2 particles facilitate water absorption of the thin films, making SrTiO3 act as an effective solid state electrolyte for the anodic oxidation to achieve higher breakdown strength.","Li, Fei;Yao, Manwen;Su, Zhen;Chen, Jianwen;Peng, Yong;Li, Qiuxia;Yao, Xi",2017-03-31,Ceramics International,"SrTiO3/nano-SiO2,Composite film,Absorbed water,Anodic oxidation,Breakdown strength,Sol-gel technology",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.161,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.161
A study of surface-coated SiC whiskers on carbon fiber substrates and their properties for diesel particulate filter applications,"β-Silicon carbide (β-SiC) whiskers were synthesized on carbon fiber substrates using a chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) vapor–solid (VS) growth mechanism. An additional SiC surface coating process was utilized after whisker deposition by controlling the input gas ratio of the source gas flow and changing the H2 (hydrogen) diluent gas to N2 (nitrogen) under the same deposition temperature of 1,300°C. As the surface coating deposition time increased, whiskers thickness and spherical blunt tips which were seen at the top edge of the whiskers went thicker. Observing the microstructure of the resulting tips by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that uncoated whiskers showed few stacking faults, whereas surface-coated whiskers were completely filled with stacking faults. The effect of surface coating deposition time was also evaluated by measuring the properties of a filtration system. Specifically, as the surface coating deposition time increased, gas permeability decreased; however, even at 30min, the gas permeability of the thickest surface coated whisker filters was five times higher than that of cordierite honeycomb, which is currently used in commercial diesel particulate filter (DPF) devices. A specimen that had been surface coated for more than 20min almost completely maintained its prime line density under high-pressure (5MPa) gas. Moreover, we confirmed that SiC surface coating on whiskers and carbon fiber substrates enhanced oxidation resistance and filtration efficiency.","Choi, Yoo Youl;Kim, Jun Gyu;Lee, Kyu Min;Sohn, Hyun Chul;Choi, Doo Jin",2011-05-31,Ceramics International,"D.

Synthesis and characterization of aluminum oxide–boron carbide coatings by air plasma spraying,"Aluminum oxide (Al2O3)–boron carbide (B4C) composites have been proposed for use as cutting tools as well as in high temperature applications due to their high hardness and fracture toughness. The air plasma spraying method was used to fabricate the composite coatings of Al2O3 and B4C. Three different Al2O3:B4C composition ratios of 90:10, 80:20, and 70:30 by weight were plasma sprayed on plain carbon steel substrates. The effect of B4C content on microstructure, hardness, porosity and thermal diffusivity of the coatings were studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), microhardness testing, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the flash diffusivity method. The plasma spray parameters were optimized in order to achieve a theoretical density of approximately 90%.","Datye, Amit;Koneti, Srinivasarao;Gomes, George;Wu, Kuang-Hsi;Lin, Hua-Tay",2010-07-31,Ceramics International,"Air plasma spraying,Alumina,Boron carbide,Thermal diffusivity,Vickers hardness",10.1016/j.ceramint.2010.02.024,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2010.02.024
Biodegradation assessment of nanostructured fluoridated hydroxyapatite coatings on biomedical grade magnesium alloy,"The challenges associated with managing Mg degradation rate demand novel technologies to ensure its biological safety and reliability. Here, fluoridated hydroxyapatite nanopowders with different degrees of fluoridation were coated on microarc oxidized AZ91 magnesium alloy via the electrophoretic deposition method. Zeta potential and conductivity monitoring techniques were employed to offer appropriate conditions for the coatings. The bio-corrosion process and the associated mineralization were interpreted during the immersion in simulated body fluid solution. Based on the results, the 25% fluorine substituted hydroxyapatite coating on microarc-treated AZ91 implant was proposed to stimulate bone ingrowth in a minor invasive behavior and without post-operative complications during its lifespan.","Rojaee, Ramin;Fathi, Mohammadhossein;Raeissi, Keyvan;Sharifnabi, Ali",2014-11-30,Ceramics International,"Bio-degradable implants,Magnesium,Fluor-hydroxyapatite,Electrophoretic deposition",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.06.129,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.06.129
Electron beam physical vapour deposition and mechanical properties of c-ZrO2-ZTA-coatings on alloy 617 substrates,"Multilayered zirconia toughened alumina (ZTA) and c-zirconia coatings were prepared using electron beam physical vapour deposition (EB-PVD). Characterizations of the morphology and chemical composition of the deposited coatings were performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). Scratch resistance, nano-indentation and bending strength were used for the evaluation of the mechanical properties. X-ray diffraction of the top ceramic TBC surface showed that it consists entirely of cubic ZrO2 phase. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis (EDS) showed that α-Al2O3 is the only oxide phase present at the interface, while SEM indicated the presence of columnar c-ZrO2 as the only phase of the top coat. Delamination over a large region was observed in the case of double layer (ZTA) coating. In contrast, the multilayered (ZTA1+ZTA2+c-Z) coating showed neither delamination nor cracking. The hardness and scratch measurements showed that the top coat c-ZrO2 layer is harder than the ZTA layers. The thermal conductivity of the multilayer coatings was estimated using the theoretical density and thermal conductivity values of zirconia toughened alumina (ZTA) and cubic-zirconia (c-ZrO2) together with their experimentally measured data.","Roos, E.;Naga, S.M.;Richter, R.N.;Lauf, S.;Awaad, M.;Lyutovich, A.;Tameem, M.A.",2012-05-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Lanthanum magnesium hexaluminate thermal barrier coatings with pre-implanted vertical microcracks: Thermal cycling lifetime and CMAS corrosion behaviour,"Atmospheric plasma-sprayed (APS) coatings have a layered structure as well as lower strain tolerance and a shorter lifetime than EB-PVD coatings. In this study, TBCs composed of a LaMgAl11O19 (LMA) top coat and a NiCrAlY bond coat were prepared by APS coupled with dry-ice blasting to implant vertical microcracks in the top coat. The thermal cycling lifetime and CMAS corrosion behaviour of LMA-TBCs with pre-implanted vertical microcracks were investigated in detail. The results show that the LMA top coat possesses an improved proportion of vertical microcracks and that the corresponding TBC has an improved thermal cycling lifetime. The vertical microcracks in the top coats, which not only reduce the thermal stress but also improve the strain tolerance of TBCs, dramatically contribute to the improvement in the thermal cycling lifetime. Surprisingly, the CMAS corrosion resistance of LMA-type TBCs with implanted vertical microcracks is better than that of conventional TBCs with a typical layered structure.","Zeng, Jinyan;Sun, Junbin;Zhang, Hao;Yang, Xiong;Qiu, Fengyuan;Zhou, Peifan;Niu, Wenbo;Dong, Shujuan;Zhou, Xin;Cao, Xueqiang",2018-07-31,Ceramics International,"LaMgAl11O19 thermal barrier coatings,Dry-ice blasting,Vertical microcracks,Thermal cycling lifetime,CMAS corrosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.209,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.209
Influence of B4C on oxidation resistance of PSN/borosilicate glass-B4C field-based repair coating of C/C aircraft brake materials at 700–900 °C,"PSN/borosilicate glass-B4C coating was designed for use as field-based repair coating on carbon/carbon (C/C) composites for aircraft brakes. The first PSN layer was transition layer that improved wettability between glass coating and C/C, and the second layer of borosilicate glass-B4C formed outer glass layer. Effect of B4C content on oxidation behavior of C/C repair coating was investigated. The coating with 25 wt% B4C demonstrated excellent oxidation resistance and could effectively protect C/C composites from oxidation. Weight losses of −3.1% at 700 °C and −2.9% at 900 °C were observed after being oxidized for 10 h. Repair coating with smooth, dense, and crack-free structure could be rapidly formed as B4C content of the coating increased to 25 wt% and 35 wt% with increasing oxidation time. B4C in repair coating could be oxidized into B2O3 glass and it could heal defects in the coating. Residual B4C dispersed in the coating could dispersion strengthen glass coating and inhibit crack formation in the coating.","Deng, Juanli;Hu, Kaiyue;Lu, Baofu;Zheng, Bohan;Fan, Shangwu;Zhang, Litong;Cheng, Laifei",2019-11-30,Ceramics International,"Borosilicate glass,B4C,Antioxidation,Self-healing,Repair coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.075,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.075
Effects of BN/SiC dual-layer interphase on mechanical and dielectric properties of SiCf/SiC composites,"BN/SiC dual-layer interphase in SiCf/SiC composites was successfully prepared using urea–boric acid solution as precursor for dip-coating process and PCS/xylene solution for PIP process. XRD and Raman spectrum results show that both BN and SiC sub-layers have relatively low crystalline degree. The surface of as-prepared BN/SiC dual-layer interphase is smooth and homogeneous, and its thickness is about 0.42μm. The flexural strength and failure displacement of composites with BN/SiC dual-layer interphase are improved conspicuously to 272MPa and 0.26mm, which are both much higher than those of composites without interphase, whose ultimate values are only 126MPa and 0.14mm, respectively. The composites with dual-layer interphase show better anti-oxidation capability than do the composites with BN interphase below 1000°C. ε′ and ε″ of the composites increase from 30−i22 to 45−i32 after incorporation of dual-layer interphase, which are caused by relaxation polarization and conductance losses established in the components, including fibers, matrix and interphase.","Mu, Yang;Zhou, Wancheng;Luo, Fa;Zhu, Dongmei",2014-03-31,Ceramics International,"B.

"Microstructural, mechanical and tribological properties of nanostructured YSZ coatings produced with different APS process parameters","Plasma sprayed ceramic coatings can be used in turbine engines as thermal barrier or abradable coatings, in order to improve the durability of the components as well as the efficiency. The presence of nanostructures, deriving from partial melting of agglomerated nanostructured particles, represents an interesting technological solution in order to improve their functional characteristics. In this work nanostructured yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) coatings were deposited by air plasma spraying (APS). The influence of the main process parameters on their microstructural, mechanical and tribological properties was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), indentation techniques at micro- and nano-scale and wear tests, respectively. Their porous microstructure was composed of well melted overlapped splats and partially melted nanostructured areas. This bimodal microstructure led to a bimodal distribution of the mechanical properties. An increase of plasma power and spraying distance was able to produce denser coatings, with lower content of embedded nanostructures, which exhibited higher elastic modulus and hardness as well as lower wear rate.","Lamuta, C.;Di Girolamo, G.;Pagnotta, L.",2015-08-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Improving the flexural property and long-lasting anti-ablation performance of the CVD-HfC coating by in-situ growing HfC nanowires,"HfC nanowires (HfCNWs) were in-situ synthesized via CVD technique and acted as the reinforcement in the CVD-HfC coating for C/C composites. The morphology, flexural property and long-lasting anti-ablation performance of the HfC coating were researched. The deposition efficiency and compactness of the HfC coating were both elevated by virtue of in-situ growing HfCNWs. The flexural property of the coated C/C exhibited a pronounced increment on account of incorporating HfCNWs. HfCNWs formed an interlocking network in the oxide layer and inhibited the coating delamination or spalling in harsh ablation condition, so the long-lasting anti-ablation performance of the HfCNWs-reinforced HfC coating improved. After exposure to the oxyacetylene flame for 120 s, the mass and linear ablation rates of the HfCNWs-HfC-coated C/C were only 0.57 mg/s and -0.35 μm/s, which were 54.03% and 117.77% reduction in comparison with those of the HfC-coated C/C (1.24 mg/s and 1.97 μm/s).","Ren, Jincui;Zhang, Yulei;Zhang, Jian;Fu, Yanqin",2019-12-15,Ceramics International,"In-situ HfC nanowire,HfC coating,CVD,Flexural property,Long-lasting anti-ablation performance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.143,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.143
Tribological behaviors in air and seawater of CrN/TiN superlattice coatings irradiated by high-intensity pulsed ion beam,"Surface integrity and interface structure of coating materials play a key role in tribological and corrosion behaviors in harsh working environments in nuclear power plants. In this work, we focus on the investigations of tribological behaviors in air and seawater of CrN/TiN superlattice coatings deposited by the combined deep oscillation magnetron sputtering with pulsed dc magnetron sputtering, which were irradiated by high-intensity pulsed ion beam (HIPIB) with ion energy density of 1–3 J/cm2 and shot number of 1–5. At 1 J/cm2, the increased shot number leads to a broaden (111) peak of face-centered cubic crystal structure, indicating grain size refinement. At 3 J/cm2, the increased shot number results in the coarsening grain, and superlattice structure gradually disappeared at 2 shots, finally the coatings fell off from substrate at 5 shots. The highest hardness (H), H/E* (E*, effective Young’s modulus) and H3/E*2 of the coatings irradiated at 1 J/cm2 and 5 shots are achieved at 38.7 GPa, 0.1 and 0.387, respectively. The increased ion energy density and shot number result in the decrease in Rockwell C HF adhesion level from HF1 to HF6. At 1 Jcm−2 and 1 shot, tribological behavior of irradiated coatings in air was dominated by oxidative wear with coefficient of friction (COF) of 0.51 and specific wear rate of 4.2 × 10−7mm3N−1m−1. The irradiated coatings show excellent tribocorrosion properties in seawater with high open circuit potential of 0.32 V, low COF of 0.14 and specific tribocorrosion rate of 6.1 × 10−8mm3N−1m−1 without pitting corrosion under moderate HIPIB irradiation due to high surface integrity and stability of well-defined interfaces and dense microstructure. With an increase of energy density and shot number, wear mechanism in air changes to severe adhesive and oxidative wear, while tribocorrosion mechanism is gradually dominated by plough wear coupled with pitting corrosion.","Ou, Y.X.;Wang, H.Q.;Liao, B.;Lei, M.K.;Ouyang, X.P.",2019-12-15,Ceramics International,"Deep oscillation magnetron sputtering,High-intensity pulsed ion beam,CrN/TiN superlattice coatings,Adhesion,Tribocorrosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.162,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.162
Film thickness effect on texture and residual stress sign transition in sputtered TiN thin films,"Residual stress in thin films and coatings strongly affects their properties and behavior in service. Comprehensive understanding and precise measurements of residual stress are prerequisites for preparing high quality films and coatings. Residual stresses in TiN films with different thickness were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD) employing the cos2 α sin2 ψ method with certain optimization. Grazing incidence parallel beam optics was combined with side-inclination geometry using in-house designed sample stage to ensure results accuracy. To validate this method, TiN films with thickness ranging from 1 to 3µm were deposited on (100) Si single crystal substrates at 300°C by RF magnetron sputtering. High compressive −2GPa residual stress was present in the 0.9µm thick film and decreased with film thickness. Tensile stress of less than 0.3GPa was present in 2µm TiN film. Compressive-to-tensile residual stress transition was observed with the film thickness increase. Microstructure change with growth, annihilation of grain boudaries, atomic peening and recovery mechanisms are responsible for the reported stress sign transition.","Xi, Yeting;Gao, Kewei;Pang, Xiaolu;Yang, Huisheng;Xiong, Xiaotao;Li, Hong;Volinsky, Alex A.",2017-10-15,Ceramics International,"Ceramic films,GIXRD,Texture,Residual stress,Compressive-to-tensile transition,Mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.050,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.050

Elastic and thermodynamic properties of high entropy carbide (HfTaZrTi)C and (HfTaZrNb)C from ab initio investigation,"The elastic and thermodynamic properties of novel high entropy carbide (HfTaZrTi)C and (HfTaZrNb)C are studied within density functional theory framework, adopting special quasi-random structure to model the chemical disorder of high entropy compounds. The optimized lattice parameters are in good agreement with the available experimental data. Both high entropy carbides are thermodynamically stable due to the negative formation enthalpies. Then mechanical properties in small elastic range are studied, results show that (HfTaZrTi)C and (HfTaZrNb)C are mechanical stable, and (HfTaZrNb)C has greater strength and stiffness in spite of larger brittleness due to stronger covalent bonds. The derived higher Debye temperature of (HfTaZrNb)C indicates stronger covalent interactions. The calculated electronic structures show covalent characteristics accompanied by ionicity for both (HfTaZrTi)C and (HfTaZrNb)C. The thermodynamic properties are further investigated by further combination with Debye-Grüneisen model. As temperature increases, thermodynamic properties of two materials exhibit essentially similar trend, and (HfTaZrTi)C may be more beneficial for reducing the thermal stress mismatch as a tool coating due to larger thermal expansion coefficient whilst (HfTaZrNb)C has strength advantage of greater bulk modulus in engineering applications.

Preparation and characterization of nanocrystalline β-Nb2N coating on 430 ferritic stainless steel by disproportionation of Nb(IV) ions in molten salt,"β-Nb2N, a transition metal nitride, has attracted significant interest due to its high hardness, high electrical conductivity, as well as its good corrosion and wear resistance. Herein, a simple novel method to prepare nanocrystalline β-Nb2N coating on 430 stainless steel substrate by disproportionation of Nb(IV) ions in molten salt is developed and presented. Through this method, a dense, crack-free, uniform, and well-adhered nanocrystalline β-Nb2N coating is obtained in NaCl–KCl–NaF–NbCl5–Nb melt at 850 °C for 5 h. Additionally, effects of temperature and duration on β-Nb2N coating formation are also investigated. Results indicate that higher temperature and longer duration are more favorable for β-Nb2N coating formation. Furthermore, the corrosion behavior of the coating was studied by potentiodynamic polarization in 3.5% NaCl solution.

Properties and in vitro assessment of ZrO2-based coatings obtained by atmospheric plasma jet spraying on biodegradable Mg-Ca and Mg-Ca-Zr alloys,"Magnesium (Mg)-based biodegradable alloys have gained a major interest in the biomedical field. The advantages of Mg alloys are depicted by their high biocompatibility, easy biodegradation and satisfactory mechanical properties. However, one major disadvantage of these alloys is represented by their low corrosion resistance in physiological environment. Coatings are considered to be a viable alternative used to improve corrosion, mechanical and cell viability properties of Mg- based metallic alloys. In this paper, two types of ceramic coating materials ZrO2-Y2O3 and ZrO2-CaO were deposited on Mg-Ca and Mg-Ca-Zr substrates by the atmospheric plasma jet technique. The two types of the deposited coatings exhibit similar Young modulus and a hardness in the range of 0.2–0.4 GPa. Values of the elastic modulus for the layers were measured to be in the range of 11–27 GPa for ZrO2-Y2O3 and of 16–31 GPa for ZrO2-CaO. The corrosion rate for the ZrO2-CaO coating has superior values than that for the ZrO2-Y2O3 one. The ZrO2-CaO coated samples present a better adhesion to the substrate. The MTT colorimetric tests (3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol–2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) did not reveal significant differences in cytocompatibility between the two types of coatings, presenting a moderate cell viability.","Istrate, Bogdan;Rau, Julietta V.;Munteanu, Corneliu;Antoniac, Iulian V.;Saceleanu, Vicentiu",2020-07-31,Ceramics International,"Mg-Ca and Mg-Ca-Zr alloys,ZrO2-Y2O3 and ZrO2-CaO coatings,Atmospheric plasma jet deposition,Biodegradation,Human osteosarcoma cell line",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.138,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.138
"Analysis of morphological, microstructural, electrochemical and nano mechanical characteristics of TiCN coatings prepared under N2 gas flow rate by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) process at higher temperature","In the present study, Titanium carbon nitride (TiCN) thin films have been synthesized over Si (100) substrate using chemical vapour deposition (CVD) process under N2 gas flow rate to study the suitability of CVD for the growth of TiCN coating over machine tools. The morphological, structural, corrosion behavior and mechanical properties of the coatings have been characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), corrosion test and Nano-indentation. SEM images revealed a smoother morphology of the TiCN coating surface without any pores. The AFM results revealed an increase in surface roughness from 40.88 nm to 48.25 nm. The particle size of TiCN thin film also found to be increasing with a higher N2 flow rate. The XRD peaks of TiCN were observed in the range of 37°-38°. 44°-44.5° and 61°- 62° attributed to (111), (200) and (220) crystal plane. The XRD results also confirmed the presence of stress in the coatings. The polarization test indicates a reduction of corrosion resistance with a higher N2 gas flow rate. The mechanical properties investigated by the nano-indentation method indicated an increase in Hardness (H) and Young's modulus (E) of the coating with a higher N2 flow rate.

The coatings with and without laser cladding were subjected to a hot corrosion test at 1000°C for 30h in which a mixture of 55wt% V2O5 and 45wt% Na2SO4 was used as the corrosive salt. SEM micrographs and EDS analysis confirmed the formation of YVO4 rod-shaped crystals dispersed on the surface of the APSed YSZ coatings after hot corrosion test, while these crystals were hardly detected in the laser clad coatings. The SEM micrograph of the cross section of the APSed YSZ coatings revealed cracks and a thermally grown oxide (TGO) layer in the bond coat/top coat interface, which led to the complete delamination of the coatings. Supporting the SEM micrographs, XRD patterns indicated the transformation of metastable tetragonal zirconia (t′-ZrO2) to monoclinic zirconia (m-ZrO2) after hot corrosion test. This structural transformation was due to the reaction of the molten salts with Y2O3 (zirconia stabilizer) which destabilized the t′-ZrO2. To compare the hot corrosion resistance of the APSed YSZ and the laser clad coating, the volume percentage of the undesirable m-ZrO2 was then calculated after the hot corrosion test. This calculation revealed a higher amount of m-ZrO2 in YSZ (about 70vol%) compared to that of the laser clad coating (about 13vol%).","Soleimanipour, Zohre;Baghshahi, Saeid;Shoja-razavi, Reza;Salehi, Mehdi",2016-11-15,Ceramics International,"Laser clad,Thermal barrier coating,Hot corrosion,Air plasma spray,YSZ",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.08.090,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.08.090
LiTa2PO8 coated nickel-rich cathode material for improved electrochemical performance at high voltage,"LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM) will have higher energy density at high voltage, but severe electrochemical polarization and capacity decay are likely to occur because of structural degradation. In this paper, LiTa2PO8 is used as a coating layer to modify the NCM. Covered with a 2–4 nm coating layer, the material structure does not change significantly, and the structure is more stable. More importantly, LiTa2PO8 has an ordered channel with three-dimensional Li+ ion transport, which plays a key role in improving Li+ transmission efficiency. The results show that the electrochemical properties of the material are significantly improved after coating at high voltage. After 100 cycles, the capacity retention increases from 71.58% to 84.85%, voltage stability also notably improved, the polarization is weaker, and the reversible charge and discharge capacity at high rate (3C) is significantly higher than that of raw materials. The change in morphology after 100 cycles proves that the LiTa2PO8 coating prevents direct contact between the cathode materials and the electrolyte, inhibits the side reaction and enhance the surface structure stability of the cathode materials.","Xiao, Zhongliang;Chi, Zhenzhen;Song, Liubin;Cao, Zhong;Li, Anxian",2020-04-15,Ceramics International,"Lithium ion battery,High working voltage,High rate performance,Security,Cycling ability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.064,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.064
Crack-free nanostructured BaTiO3 thin films prepared by sol–gel dip-coating technique,"In this report, crack-free nanostructured barium titanate thin films are prepared by a sol–gel processing method. Glacial acetic acid, barium acetate, titanium tetraisopropyl alkoxide, 2-propanol and deionized water are used as precursors for preparing stable precursor solution. Then very thin films (thickness=26nm) are deposited on fused silica substrates. In order to prepare crack-free thin films of BaTiO3, much attention is given to solvent evaporation process and a controlled pre-drying process is developed. It is found that the control of the process, especially in the initial stage of drying process is crucial and important for preparation of the crack-free ultrathin nanostructured BaTiO3 films. In our proposed method, as-deposited thin films undergo a slow drying process in saturated vapor pressure of the precursor solution. The above process leads to the formation of crack-free nanostructured BaTiO3 thin films. Structure and morphology of the thin films are characterized by XRD, SEM and AFM characterization methods. Results indicate that the thin films are crack-free with a dense nanogranular structure.","Ashiri, R.;Nemati, A.;Sasani Ghamsari, M.",2014-07-31,Ceramics International,"A.

The synthesis and characterization of CVD ZrB2 coating from ZrCl4-BCl3-H2-Ar system,"By conducting thermodynamics calculations and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) experiments, the synthesis and characterization of CVD ZrB2 from ZrCl4-BCl3-H2-Ar system at low pressure were investigated. Cauliflower-shaped, dense ZrB2 coating was successfully deposited on graphite substrates and carbon fibers under appropriate parameters. Calculation results indicate that the yield of ZrB2 increases with increasing temperature. The amount of ZrB2 increases to a broad maximum with increasing H2 flux and then remains constant when H2 flux reaches above 40mol. BCl3 concentration significantly affects phase composition of CVD ZrB2. Three phases are involved, namely, Zr+ZrB2, ZrB2, and ZrB2+B. Experimental results show that the temperature and H2 and BCl3 fluxes significantly affect surface roughness, growth rate, and phase composition of ZrB2 coating. The thickness and particle size of ZrB2 coating increase with the increase in temperature. However, at high temperatures, particle size decreases because particles do not have enough time to grow at high reaction rate. Morphologies of ZrB2 coating vary from porous and rough to dense and smooth with the increase in H2 flux. BCl3 reduction by H2 dominates deposition process at low BCl3 concentration, and deposition mechanism changes to the codeposition of B and ZrB2 at high BCl3 concentration.","Zhu, Yan;Cheng, Laifei;Li, Mingxing;Ma, Baisheng;Liu, Yongsheng;Zhang, Litong",2018-02-01,Ceramics International,"Chemical vapor deposition,Zirconium diboride,Thermodynamic calculation,Deposition experiment",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.145,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.145
Tuning of optical and antibacterial characteristics of ZnO thin films: Role of Ce content,"The properties of Ce-doped ZnO (CZO) thin films synthesized through sol-gel dip coating processing were evaluated. Five thin films were synthesized by increasing Ce percentage between 1–5 at. wt.%. The XRD study put forward that Ce doped ZnO displayed hexagonal wurtzite ZnO structure and Ce ions are embedded in the ZnO lattice successfully. Results showed that the crystallite size decreased, as the percentage of Ce in the ZnO increased. The lattice volume of the thin film was distorted in the presence of Ce. Broadening and shrinking of the band gap took place under different Ce doping concentrations due to generation of defects and appearance of secondary phase. All thin film has shown antibacterial activity.","Kayani, Zohra Nazir;Sahar, Sonia;Riaz, Saira;Naseem, Shahzad",2019-02-15,Ceramics International,"Ce-doped ZnO,Band gap,Bioactivity,Sol-gel processing",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.066,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.066
Microscopic and spectroscopic evidences for multiple ion-exchange reactions controlling biomineralization of CaO.MgO.2SiO2 nanoceramics,"This study is focused on the mechanism of in vitro biomineralization on the surface of CaO.MgO.2SiO2 (diopside) nanostructured coatings by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy assessments. A homogeneous diopside coating of almost 2µm in thickness was deposited on a medical-grade stainless steel by coprecipitation, dipping and sintering sequences. After soaking the sample in a simulated body fluid (SBF) for 14 days, a layer with the thickness of 8µm is recognized to be substituted for the primary diopside deposit, suggesting the mineralization of apatite on the surface. Investigations revealed that the newly-formed layer is predominantly composed of Ca, P and Si, albeit with a biased accumulations of P and Si towards the surface and substrate, respectively. The variations in the ionic composition and pH of the SBF due to the incubation of the sample were also correlated with the above-interpreted biomineralization. In conclusion, the multiple ion-exchange reactions related to Ca, Mg, Si and P were found to be responsible for the in vitro bioactivity of nanodiopside.","Vahedifard, R.;Salahinejad, E.",2017-08-01,Ceramics International,"Films (A),Chemical properties (C),Silicate (D),Biomedical applications (E)",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.001
Superhydrophobic palmitic acid modified ZnO nanoparticles,A superhydrophobic coating material (PA-ZnO) with a static water contact angle (WCA)>160° has been synthesized by modifying zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles with room temperature stable palmitic acid (PA). ZnO nanoparticles (size ~ 24nm) with hexagonal wurtzite structure are prepared by hydrothermal method. FTIR study and TEM images confirms the grafting of palmitic acid on ZnO surface. This superhydrophobic nature of PA-ZnO has been attributed to the grafting of palmitic acid on ZnO surface which is confirmed by conducting the WCA measurement of PA-ZnO samples after heating at different temperatures. Surface morphology and roughness were observed as a function of temperature and it was observed that films morphology is changing to smoother films with low air entrapment for higher temperatures. On the same time the root mean square roughness (Rrms) is also reducing. It is observed that the superhydrophobic nature of PA-ZnO nanoparticles reduces with heating at higher temperatures and surface became like hydrophilic for heating temperature of ~ 230°C. The decrease in the WCA is attributed to the thermal decomposition of palmitic acid from ZnO surface and the same has been confirmed by thermal analysis of PA and PA-ZnO samples.,"Agrawal, Nikhil;Munjal, Sandeep;Ansari, Mohd Zubair;Khare, Neeraj",2017-11-30,Ceramics International,"Zinc oxide,Palmitic acid,Water contact angle,Superhydrophobic surface",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.176,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.176
Dielectric and electromagnetic wave absorbing properties of TiC/epoxy composites in the GHz range,"The complex permittivity and reflection loss of TiC powders filled with epoxy resin were investigated in the frequency range of 2.6–18GHz. Both the real and imaginary parts of the complex permittivity increased with increasing TiC content. A rapid increase in complex permittivity and strong frequency dependence characteristics was observed for the composite filled with high content of TiC. Based on the transmission line theory, single-layer and multi-layer absorbing coatings were designed. For single-layer coatings, the reflection loss below −5dB (over 70% microwave absorbing) can be obtained in the frequency range of 13–18GHz for the composite with 50wt% TiC and 7–15.2GHz for the composite with 60wt% TiC. By optimizing the absorber structure and the associated thickness, the absorbing bandwidth of the multi-layer absorber can be largely broadened. The reflection loss below −5dB can be obtained in the frequency range of 2.9–18GHz for the four-layer absorber.","Wang, Yuan;Luo, Fa;Zhou, Wancheng;Zhu, Dongmei",2014-08-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Microstructure and ablative properties of Si-SiC coating prepared by spark plasma sintering,"In order to improve ablation resistance of graphite, Si-SiC coatings were fabricated on the graphite substrate by spark plasma sintering. Effects of the sintering temperature and composition were investigated on the microstructure and ablation resistance of the coatings. Phase synthesis and microstructure were studied by X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscope, respectively. SiC was successfully in-situ synthesized by SPS of Si–SiC–Al2O3 powders mixture. The results of ablation test showed that the ablation resistance of the graphite was remarkably enhanced and the sample with 30 wt% Si had the optimum properties which was sintered at 1400 °C.

Selective laser melting for the preparation of an ultra-high temperature ceramic coating,"Selective laser melting of a ZrB2, ZrC, and B4C powder blend was chosen to explore the use of the additive manufacturing technology to prepare dense ceramic coatings on a metallic tungsten substrate. Laser powers between 200 and 400 W were used for the application of the ceramic coatings. Adherent coatings were fabricated; however, a thermal expansion mismatch between the coating and substrate proved to be detrimental to coating integrity after cross-sectioning. Analysis of the microstructure and composition of the resulting coatings was used to elucidate the effects of thermal gradients and the effects of tungsten and SiC impurities on the solidification of the ceramic coatings.

Structural and electrical properties of ZnO:Ag core-shell nanoparticles synthesized by a polymer precursor method,"Monodispersed core-shell type ZnO:Ag nanoparticles were synthesized by a polymer precursor method and their structural and electrical properties were reported in detail. The synthesis technique involves a sol-gel type chemical reaction between aqueous solutions of poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA), sucrose and Zn2+ salt. The Zn2+-PVA-sucrose polymer precursor powders so obtained after the reaction was further explored for the synthesis of ZnO:Ag nanoparticles. The key part of the work lies in the use of polymer coated ZnO nanoparticles as templates to obtain the ZnO core-Ag shell type nanostructures. Structural and spectroscopic analyses of the derived samples were performed with X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XRD patterns of the ZnO:Ag nanoparticles consist of distinct peaks corresponding to the hexagonal wurtzite type (space group P63mc) crystal structure of ZnO along with the typical peaks of face centered cubic crystal structure of metallic silver. EDS and XPS analyses confirmed the chemical composition and surface structure of the core-shell nanoparticles. Microstructural analysis revealed the monodispersed platelet shaped ZnO nanoparticles with a thin layer of Ag coating on the surface. UV–visible diffuse reflectance studies revealed the effects of Ag coating on the optical properties of the samples. Detail analysis of the dielectric properties of the samples were performed as a function of frequency (1Hz to 10MHz) and temperature (300–528K) to investigate the electrical conduction mechanism in the samples.","Jadhav, J.;Biswas, S.",2016-11-15,Ceramics International,"Core-shell nanoparticles,ZnO:Ag,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,Dielectric spectroscopy,AC conductivity,Electric modulus",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.081,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.081
An elevated temperature infrared emissivity ceramic coating formed on 2024 aluminium alloy by microarc oxidation,"An infrared emissivity coating material containing γ-Al2O3 was prepared on 2024 aluminium alloy surface by the microarc oxidation (MAO) method. The microstructure of the coatings was analysed by SEM, XRD and EDS techniques. The infrared emissivity properties tested at 500°C were investigated by an infrared radiometer based on a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The results show that the infrared emissivity values of coated Al samples depend on the phase composition and surface roughness of the coatings. Corresponding to increasing coatings thickness, the gradually increasing γ-Al2O3 content and some oxide compounds containing Si and P contribute to the higher infrared emissivity value (about 0.85) in the wavelength range of 8–20μm. The increasing surface roughness leads to an obvious increase in emissivity from 0.2 to 0.4 at wavelength 3–5μm.","Wang, Y.M.;Tian, H.;Shen, X.E.;Wen, L.;Ouyang, J.H.;Zhou, Y.;Jia, D.C.;Guo, L.X.",2013-04-30,Ceramics International,"Aluminium alloy,Ceramic coating,Microstructure,Infrared emissivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.09.060,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.09.060
Chemical corrosion of basic refractories by cement kiln materials,"The study of basic refractories corrosion by cement kiln materials was carried out with powder tests and coating tests at the typical temperature range of the sintered material in the transition zone and the sintering zone (1200–1450°C). The tested basic refractories were magnesia-spinel (MSp) and magnesia–zirconia (MZ) refractory bricks. The industry cement kiln materials were rich of sulphur and chlorine. The microstructures of the as-delivered and tested samples were researched by XRD and SEM–EDS techniques. The new phases detected in the samples with MSp (with and without ZrO2) bricks after tests at the temperature of 1200°C were binary (C12A7 t mp −1392°C, CaZrO3: t mp −2345°C) 1 1 C-CaO; A-Al2O3; S-SiO2; M-MgO; F-Fe2O3; Z-ZrO2; f-FeO; t mp – melting point; t dp – disintegration point. : and ternary (C2AS: t mp −1593°C or C3MS2: t dp −1573°C) phases.

The C3A3·CaSO4 phase was formed in the samples after the corrosion tests performed up to the temperature of 1300°C.

Functionalizing slag wool fibers with photocatalytic activity by anatase TiO2 and CTAB modification,"Anatase TiO2 coatings prepared by solvothermal process in a neutral ethanol solution of isopropyl titanate at 160°C have been grown on slag wool fibers (SWF) which were modified by hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) in advance. X-ray diffraction patterns confirmed the coatings are of a nanocrystalline anatase structure, and scanning electron microscopy observations and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum revealed a continuous coverage of TiO2 formed on the fiber surfaces. The photocatalytic activity of the samples was tested by the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) solution. The results show that CTAB modified slag wool fibers (CMSWF) are not a suitable adsorbent for MB due to their weaker negative surface charges. Anatase TiO2 coated CMSWF display higher photocatalyst activity than anatase TiO2 coated SWF without CTAB modification, and Anatase TiO2 coated CMSWF are relatively stable under UV-light irradiation.","Yang, Lirong;Wang, Chunmei;Liu, Zhigang;Liu, Xiaoyu;Song, Yang;Feng, Xiaoxin;Zhang, Baoqiang",2018-04-15,Ceramics International,"Anatase TiO2,Slag wool fibers,CTAB,Photocatalytic activity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.036,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.036
Improved electrical properties of p-type CuGaO2 semiconductor thin films through Mg and Zn doping,"Undoped, Mg-doped, and Zn-doped p-type CuGaO2 semiconductor thin films were deposited on quartz substrates by a sol-gel spin coating method. The effects of the two dopants (Mg and Zn) on the structural features and electrical properties of the CuGaO2-based thin films were investigated. The doping concentration was maintained at 1at% in the impurity doping precursor solutions. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results showed that only the undoped CuGaO2 thin films had a single delafossite phase; Mg- and Zn-doped thin films exhibited mixed CuGaO2 and CuGa2O4 phases. Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) images showed that the surfaces of the dense CuGaO2-based thin films exhibited obviously granular structures. Hall measurements confirmed that the three oxide semiconductor thin films had p-type conductivity. Compared with undoped CuGaO2 thin films, the Mg- and Zn-doped thin films exhibited improvements in electrical properties, and the Zn-doped thin films had the highest mean carrier concentration of 3.49×1016 cm−3. In addition, three kinds of n-Si/p-CuGaO2-based thin film heterojunctions were fabricated and their current-voltage (I-V) characteristics were examinated. It was found that the n-Si/p-CuGaO2:Zn heterojunction exhibited a distinct rectifying I-V characteristic with a forward turn-on voltage of 2.9V.","Tsay, Chien-Yie;Chen, Ching-Lien",2017-02-01,Ceramics International,"A.

Oxidation behavior and high-temperature flexural property of CVD-SiC-coated PIP-C/SiC composites,"Polymer infiltration pyrolysis (PIP) was used to prepare carbon fiber-reinforced silicon carbide (C/SiC) composites, and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) was employed to fabricate SiC coating. The oxidation behavior at 1700 °C and the flexural property at 1200 °C were tested. SiC coating exerted remarkable oxidation effects on PIP-C/SiC composites. In the absence of coating, PIP-C/SiC composites lost 29.2% of its mass, with merely 6.74% of the original flexural strength retained. In contrast, CVD-SiC coated PIP-C/SiC composites had the mass loss of 10.2% and the flexural strength retention ratio of 23.4%. In high-temperature tests, SiC coating played an important role in the flexural strength of PIP-C/SiC composites. The flexural strength of uncoated composites became 330.7 MPa, and that of coated ones reduced from 655.3 to 531.2 MPa.","Jin, Wen;Si, Zhou;Lu, Yi;Bei-zhi, Sun;Yi, Wang;Guang-de, Li;Zhong-fang, Xing;Jie, Cao;Heng-ping, He;Yang, Xiang",2018-10-01,Ceramics International,"C/SiC,PIP,CVD,Oxidation,High temperature",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.082,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.082
Effect of the precursor nature and preparation mode on the coarsening of La2Zr2O7 compounds,"This study addresses the thermal behavior of La2Zr2O7 powders prepared via two different synthetic routes and the effect of the zirconium counter-cation on their properties, as carried out by dilatometric experiments. Citrate-based compounds exhibit shrinkage, regardless of the precursors used. Preliminary thermal treatment permits the reduction in shrinkage. Nitrate based compounds calcinated at 600°C show a higher shrinkage (−9.4%) than at 1200°C (−5.2%) because of the decomposition of the trapped precursors, as revealed by DTA–TGA–MS. Coprecipitated samples present different behaviors as a function of the counter-cation nature. Chloride based compounds leads to shrinkage and phase mixtures, whereas expansion is observed for pure pyrochlore compounds that are synthesized with nitrate. The thermal expansion coefficients of the different compounds are similar to the literature values (9.5–10.10−6 K−1). This study allowed for a better understanding of the densification of the La2Zr2O7 material and its adjusted properties, as a function of the precursor nature and the preparation mode, for application in thermal barrier coatings.","Duarte, William;Vardelle, Michel;Rossignol, Sylvie",2016-01-31,Ceramics International,"La2Zr2O7,Coarsening,TBC,Preparation mode,Precursor",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.09.051,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.09.051
"Effect of annealing temperature on the evolution of structural, microstructural, and optical properties of spin coated ZnO thin films","Zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films were sol-gel spin coated on glass substrates and annealed at various temperatures from 300–500°C. Zinc acetate dihydrate (ZAD), monoethanolamine (MEA), and 2-methoxyethanol were used as the starting materials, stabilizer and solvent, respectively. The effect of annealing temperature on the structural and optical properties of the ZnO thin films was investigated by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), atomic force microscope (AFM), UV–VIS spectrophotometry and ellipsometry. The XRD results showed the films to have a preferential c-axis orientation, whereas the AFM results confirmed a columnar structure. The surface roughness increased with the increase in annealing temperature. Parameters such as ratio of free charge carrier concentration to effective mass (N/m*) and plasma frequency (ω p ) were determined from the transmittance graph using the Wemple di Domenico model. Both N/m* and ω p were noticed to reduce with the increase in annealing temperature.

Microstructure characterization of thermal barrier coating systems after controlled exposure to a high temperature,"Air plasma spray-deposited thermal barrier coatings were thoroughly characterized after exposure to a high temperature. Microstructural changes in the thermal barrier coatings, as a function of temperature and soaking time, are reported. Pores in the ceramic top coat were redistributed and rounded due to sintering, which increases density and thermal conductivity. Formation of the undesirable monoclinic phase was detected after 600h at 1100°C; the amount of this phase increased with exposure time, reaching 18wt% after 1000h. The thermally grown oxide layer reached a critical thickness of 5µm after 600h at 1100°C even though no delamination was observed after 1700h of exposure when the thickness was around 6.7µm. Ni- and Cr-enriched oxides were formed, which, in theory, should favor crack generation and propagation. After 1000h, a large amount of precipitates in the Ni-base substrate were observed and characterized.","Osorio, Julián D.;Hernández-Ortiz, Juan P.;Toro, Alejandro",2014-04-30,Ceramics International,"TBC,Characterization,High temperature,Phase transformation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.09.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.09.007
Preoxidation of bond coat in IN-738LC/NiCrAlY/LaMgAl11O19 thermal barrier coating system,"The low thickness of thermally grown oxide (TGO) layer and presence of amorphous phase in the as-sprayed LaMgAl11O19 (LaMA) coating reduce the thermal cycling lifetime of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). In the present study, the as-sprayed Ni-22Cr-10Al-1.0Y bond coat was preoxidized at 1060 °C to produce a continuous oxide scale prior to subsequent deposition of the ceramic top coat. The optimum time of peroxidation treatment and thickness of the continuous aluminum oxide layer were estimated 15 h and 2 µm respectively. The oxidized layer due to the preoxidation treatment of bond coating reduces the amorphous phase in as-sprayed LaMA coating and increases the microhardness of LaMA coating from approximately 600 to 900HV. Also, preoxidation of the NiCrAlY bond coating increases adhesion strength of the LaMA top coating, even slightly more than the adhesion strength of the as-spray 8YSZ coating.

Hot corrosion tests were carried at 700°C, 800°C and 900°C for 4h, and corroded surfaces were investigated using X-ray diffractometer and scanning electron microscopy. The corrosion products of Sm2Zr2O7 ceramics were composed of SmVO4 and monoclinic-ZrO2, while those of (Sm0.5Sc0.5)2Zr2O7 ceramic consisted of SmVO4 and Zr5Sc2O13. Considering the fact that Zr5Sc2O13 is more desirable than monoclinic-ZrO2 for thermal barrier coating applications, (Sm0.5Sc0.5)2Zr2O7 showed better corrosion resistance to Na2SO4+V2O5 salt than Sm2Zr2O7.

La2(MoO4)3@C as novel anode for lithium ion battery: Structural and chemical evolutions upon electrochemical cycling,"La2(MoO4)3 is a kind of transition metal molybdate. It has been proved to be a possible anode material for lithium ion batteries due to the high theoretical capacity. In this work, molybdenum-based La2(MoO4)3 material is successfully synthesized through a traditional solid-state reaction method. Carbon-coated La2(MoO4)3 is designed by using glucose as carbon source. By comparing the carbon-coated La2(MoO4)3 with the carbon-free La2(MoO4)3, carbon-coated La2(MoO4)3 delivers better cyclic stability and rate performance. Carbon-coated La2(MoO4)3 obtains a reversible charge capacity of 525.9 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 100 cycles, corresponding to capacity retention of 75.2%. However, the capacity retention of carbon-free La2(MoO4)3 is only 33.4%. The results indicate that carbon layer can evidently alleviate the irreversibility of structure and improve capacity retention of La2(MoO4)3. It demonstrates that the carbon-coated La2(MoO4)3 composite can be a possible anode candidate for high capacity lithium ion batteries. In addition, in-situ X-ray diffraction investigation (XRD), ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and ex-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are employed to analyze the electrochemical behavior during process of cycling. These experimental results indicate that the conversion behavior of La2(MoO4)3 upon lithiation/delithiation is a process of structural pulverization. Based on that, our work provides guidance for the research of molybdenum-based electrode materials.","Jiang, Cheng;Liu, Tingting;Zheng, Runtian;Peng, Na;Zhang, Jundong;Cheng, Xing;Yu, Haoxiang;Shui, Miao;Shu, Jie",2019-04-15,Ceramics International,"Lithium-ion batteries,Anode material,La2(MoO4)3,Carbon coating,Electrochemical reaction mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.079,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.079
Synthesis and color properties of neodymium–doped holmium molybdate pigments with allochroic effect,"A series of neodymium–doped holmium molybdate (Ho1-x Nd x )2MoO6 (x = 0-0.8) color pigments with ‘allochroic effect’ were synthesized by a solid-phase reaction method under different conditions (i.e., sintering temperature, sintering time, and neodymium ions (Nd3+) doping amount). The as-synthesized pigments were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC), ultraviolet–visible–near infrared (UV-VIS-NIR) spectrophotometry and CIE L*a*b* color scale. The results show that the adulteration of Nd3+ ions does not alter the crystal structure of Ho2MoO6 basically, but causes the lattice expansion for the pigments sintered at <1200 °C for 3 h. The pigments as powders or coatings on glass or ceramic tile have an allochroic effect under different illuminant sources (i.e., solar-light D65, incandescent lamp A, cool white fluorescent lamp F2 and three-band fluorescent lamp F11). For the pigment with Nd3+ ions doping amount of 0.2, the color difference (ΔE*) between standard illuminants D65 and F11 is 14.58, and the ΔE* value between any two standard illuminants is greater than 5.6, showing an intense allochroic effect. Based on the analysis of the abundant energy level structure of holmium ions (Ho3+) and Nd3+ ions and the spectral power difference of illuminant sources, the pigments have color variation under different illuminant sources. The pigments with a good thermal stability at high temperatures (i.e., 700–1200oC) can be used as promising functional pigments with ‘allochroic effect’ for glass or ceramic decoration.","Li, Xiangyu;Wang, Yanmin;Pan, Zhidong",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Neodymium,Holmium molybdate,Allochroic effect,Functional pigment",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.155,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.155
Effect of GDC addition method on the properties of LSM–YSZ composite cathode support for solid oxide fuel cells,"Equal amounts of Gd0.1Ce0.9O2−δ (GDC) were added to La0.65Sr0.3MnO3−δ /(Y2O3)0.08(ZrO2)0.92 (LSM/YSZ) powder either by physical mixing or by sol–gel process, to produce a porous cathode support for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). The effect of the GDC mixing method was analyzed in view of sinterability, thermal expansion coefficient, microstructure, porosity, and electrical conductivity of the LSM/YSZ composite. GDC infiltrated LSM/YSZ (G-LY) composite showed a highly porous microstructure when compared with mechanically mixed LSM/YSZ (LY) and LSM/YSZ/GDC (LYG) composites. The cathode support composites were used to fabricate the button SOFCs by slurry coating of YSZ electrolyte and a nickel/YSZ anode functional layer, followed by co-firing at 1250°C. The G-LY composite cathode-supported SOFC showed maximum power densities of 215, 316, and 396mWcm−2 at 750, 800, and 850°C, respectively, using dry hydrogen as fuel. Results showed that the GDC deposition by sol–gel process on LSM/YSZ powder before sintering is a promising technique for producing porous cathode support for the SOFCs.","Rehman, Saeed Ur;Song, Rak-Hyun;Lee, Jong-Won;Lim, Tak-Hyoung;Park, Seok-Joo;Lee, Seung-Bok",2016-08-01,Ceramics International,"Solid oxide fuel cell,Composite cathode support,Mixing method,Microstructure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.098,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.098

One-pot fabrication of fluoride-silica@silica raspberry-like nanoparticles for superhydrophobic coating,"A facile and effective method to fabricate raspberry-like nanoparticles is reported in a one-pot reaction. This method consists of two steps: preparation of silica nanoparticle precursors dispersion via the Stober process and growth of the tiny functional fluoride-silica nanoparticles on the surface of silica nanoparticle precursors via the hydrolysis-condensation reaction of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and 1H,1H,2H,2H-Perfluorodecyl triethoxysilane (HDFTES). The obtained raspberry-like nanoparticle dispersion could be spray coated onto different substrates directly with the water contact angle greater than 150° and water roll-off angle less than 4°. And the prepared coatings maintained water resistance after water jetting, sand abrasion. This method can be an effective strategy for fabricating superhydrophobic surfaces for practical industrial applications.","Zhao, Zheng-Bai;Zhang, Da-Ming;Meng, Yi-Fan;Tai, Li;Jiang, Yong",2016-10-31,Ceramics International,"Raspberry-like nanoparticle,Superhydrophobic coating,Silica nanoparticle precursor,Fluoride-silica nanoparticle",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.076,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.076
Microstructure and mechanical properties of plasma sprayed alumina-based coatings,"Alumina-based coatings are employed in many industrial applications, in order to protect the surface of metal components against high temperature, wear, corrosion and erosion. In this work two different alumina-based coatings were fabricated by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS), starting from powder particles composed of pure Al2O3 and Al2O3-3wt% TiO2, respectively. Their phase composition was investigated by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and revealed that both the as-sprayed coatings were mainly composed of metastable γ- and α-Al2O3 phases. The γ phase recrystallized to α phase after heat treatment. The porous microstructure was analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). Thin TiO2-rich splats were observed within the microstructure of alumina–titania coatings. The pure alumina coatings exhibited similar porosity and higher microhardness than the alumina–titania ones (12.8 against 9.9GPa). Both the coatings herein analyzed are particularly promising for high-temperature anti-wear applications, because of their enhanced mechanical properties.","Di Girolamo, G.;Brentari, A.;Blasi, C.;Serra, E.",2014-09-30,Ceramics International,"D.

Titanium implantation into boron nitride films and ion-beam mixing of titanium-boron nitride multilayers,"TiBN films of various composition and crystalline structure have been synthesized by titanium ion implantation into sub-stoichiometric and stoichiometric hexagonal boron nitride films. Due to the relatively low penetration depth of Ti+ ions these films can only be prepared with limited thickness, of the order of several hundred nanometers. TiBN films were also prepared by ion-beam mixing of multilayer coatings of the sequence Ti BN by argon ion bombardment. With these methods, inhomogeneous coatings with respect to their composition, in particular at low fluences, were obtained. All films were investigated by glancing angle X-ray diffraction. SEM, SNMS and ESCA/Auger analysis were also performed on some of the samples. Hardness and Young's modulus were determined by an ultra-low load, depth-sensing nanoindenter. Most of the results can be understood by examination of the chemical composition and crystalline structure of the films.","Gissler, Wolfram;Gibson, Peter Neil",1996-12-31,Ceramics International, ,10.1016/0272-8842(95)00115-8,https://doi.org/10.1016/0272-8842(95)00115-8
Interface interaction and structural transformation in particles of ceramic and cermet composite powders in flame spraying,"The behavior of particles of Al2O3, TiO2, Al2O3 - TiO2, Al2O3 - Ni, ZrO2 - Ni, Al2O3 - Ni- Ti powders in flame spraying has been studied. The interaction between the surface tension forces and the wetting forces has been found to produce either a melt shell around the particles core or drops of the second component on the surface of the core. Subsequently a total or partial capture of drops of the second component melt by the core melt or their separation during the movement within the plasma jet volume are possible. At high particle heating and cooling rates, polymorphous transformations, higher - to - lower oxide transformations and metastable phase fixations in the coating take place. These effects influence the conditions of ceramic powder plasma coating formation and also the properties of the coatings.","Borisov, Yu.;Borisova, A.L.",1983-12-31,Ceramics International, ,10.1016/0272-8842(83)90015-9,https://doi.org/10.1016/0272-8842(83)90015-9
Effect of splat-interface discontinuity on effective thermal conductivity of plasma sprayed thermal barrier coating,"The thermal barrier coating obtained by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS TBCs) has a distinct lamellar microstructure, in which the splats discontinuous interfaces running parallel to the metal/ceramic interface contribute largely to the reduction in the effective thermal conductivity of APS TBCs. The dependency of such contribution on the topological structure of the interface discontinuity is investigated in the present work. Firstly, the concept of discontinuity of splats interfaces was defined to quantify the splats discontinuous interfaces revealed by microscopic observations. Then, the microstructure model with a random distribution of discontinuous interfaces was established by utilizing the finite element simulation method to investigate the effect of interlayer discontinuity on thermal conductivity of the APS TBCs. Finally, an optimal topological structure of the interface discontinuity was found to be responsible for the lowest effective thermal conductivity of the APS TBCs and typical parametrical tendencies demonstrated.","Qiu, Shi-yi;Liu, Yan-Chi;Guo, Hong-bo;Huang, Chen-Guang;Ma, Yue;Wu, Chen-Wu",2020-03-31,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Plasma spraying,Interface discontinuity,Thermal conductivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.215,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.215
Enhancing the adhesion strength of tantalum oxide ceramic thin film coating on biomedical Ti–6Al–4V alloy by thermal surface treatment,"In this study, Titanium alloy (Ti–6Al–4V) substrate was coated with 4μm tantalum oxide (Ta–O) ceramic layers using physical vapor deposition magnetron sputtering (PVDMS). The coated sample surfaces were heat treated at 300, 400 and 500°C in a box furnace to enhance the adhesion strength. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) together with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and Vickers microhardness testing was used to distinguish the Ta–O coatings in terms of morphology, surface elements, structure and surface hardness, and to compare untreated and hardened sample conditions. The effect of heat treatment on adhesion was tested with scratch test equipment. The coating thin film adhesion strength improved from 713 to 1907mN throughout the thermal surface treatment duration. The effect of thermal treatment on surface hardness was examined, and evidently, the surface hardness increased from 446.24 to 535.5HV on account of the surface treatment at 500°C.","Rahmati, B.;Zalnezhad, E.;Sarhan, Ahmed A.D.;Kamiab, Z.;Nasiri Tabrizi, B.;Abas, W.A.B.W.",2015-12-31,Ceramics International,"PVD magnetron sputtering,Coating,Ti–6Al–4V,Ceramic tantalum oxide,Biomaterial",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.07.090,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.07.090
Oxidation and erosion resistant property of SiC/Si–Mo–Cr/MoSi2 multi-layer coated C/C composites,"To improve the oxidation and erosion resistance of C/C composites, a multi-layer SiC/Si–Mo–Cr/MoSi2 coating was prepared on them by a combination technique of pack cementation and a super supersonic plasma spraying technique. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy were used to analyze the phase and microstructure of the coatings. After a static oxidation test at 1773K in air for 200h, compared with the SiC/Si–Mo–Cr coated samples, the mass loss of the SiC/Si–Mo–Cr/MoSi2 coated samples decreased by 56.1%. After adding a MoSi2 layer on the SiC/Si–Mo–Cr coating by the super supersonic plasma spraying, the corrosion protection time in a wind tunnel at 1873K could be prolonged from 93h to 124h. The deposited outer MoSi2 layer could act as oxygen barrier layer and seal the initial penetrating cracks in the SiC/Si–Mo–Cr coating, resulting in the improvement of the oxidation and erosion resistance of the coated samples.","Fu, Qiangang;Shan, Yucai;Cao, Cuiwei;Li, Hejun;Li, Kezhi",2015-04-30,Ceramics International,"Coating,C/C composites,Oxidation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.11.105,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.11.105
Protective coatings for AISI 430 stainless steel at high temperatures using perovskite oxides La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 on spinel type oxide NiFe2O4,"Although oxide coatings of perovskite type deposited on ferritic stainless steel AISI 430 provide an efficient barrier to oxygen diffusion, they have shown degradation at high temperatures by formation of intermediate phases with chrome. Other coatings, such as oxide of spinel type, form an effective barrier to the diffusion of chromium; however, they do not prevent oxygen diffusion into the substrate. In this context, in order to protect against oxidation at high temperatures ferritic stainless steel AISI 430 for application as interconnects in ITSOFC, the present work aimed to develop dual layer coatings obtained by deposition of a perovskite oxide, La0.6Sr0.4CoO3, on the coating of a spinel oxide NiFe2O4. The results showed that the combination of oxide coatings increases oxidation resistance of the ferritic stainless steel and it tends to prevent degradation of the perovskite, which is caused by the diffusion of chromium from substrate to coating creating undesired phases.","Ludwig, Gustavo A.;Korb, Matias A.;Lima, Diego A.S.;Macías, Mario A.;Gauthier, Gilles H.;Malfatti, Célia F.",2015-12-31,Ceramics International,"D.

Phase structure and thermophysical properties of co-doped La2Zr2O7 ceramics for thermal barrier coatings,"La2Zr2O7 has high melting point, low thermal conductivity and relatively high thermal expansion which make it suitable for application as high-temperature thermal barrier coatings. Ceramics including La2Zr2O7, (La0.7Yb0.3)2(Zr0.7Ce0.3)2O7 and (La0.2Yb0.8)2(Zr0.7Ce0.3)2O7 were synthesized by solid state reaction. The effects of co-doping on the phase structure and thermophysical properties of La2Zr2O7 were investigated. The phase structures of these ceramics were identified by X-ray diffraction, showing that the La2Zr2O7 ceramic has a pyrochlore structure while the co-doped ceramics (La0.7Yb0.3)2(Zr0.7Ce0.3)2O7 and the (La0.2Yb0.8)2(Zr0.7Ce0.3)2O7 exhibit a defect fluorite structure, which is mainly determined by ionic radius ratio r(Aav. 3+)/r(Bav. 4+). The measurements for thermal expansion coefficient and thermal conductivity of these ceramics from ambient temperature to 1200°C show that the co-doped ceramics (La0.7Yb0.3)2(Zr0.7Ce0.3)2O7 and (La0.2Yb0.8)2(Zr0.7Ce0.3)2O7 have a larger thermal expansion coefficient and a lower thermal conductivity than La2Zr2O7, and the (La0.2Yb0.8)2(Zr0.7Ce0.3)2O7 shows the more excellent thermophysical properties than (La0.7Yb0.3)2(Zr0.7Ce0.3)2O7 due to the increase of Yb2O3 content.","Xiang, Jianying;Chen, Shuhai;Huang, Jihua;Zhang, Hua;Zhao, Xingke",2012-07-31,Ceramics International,"Thermal conductivity,Thermal expansion,Ceramic,Co-doping",10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.12.077,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.12.077
Effect of sol-layers on Sb-doped SnO2 thin films as solution-based transparent conductive oxides,"We synthesized dense Sb-doped SnO2 (ATO) thin films coated with the optimum number of sol-layers to form solution-based tranparent conductive oxides (TCOs) using a hydrothermal method and spin-coating. To investigate the effects of the sol-layers on the ATO thin films, samples with 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 sol-layers were deposited on ATO thin films with porous surface morphologies. The structures, chemical states, morphology changes, and electrical and optical properties of the samples were demonstrated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Hall effect measurement, and UV–vis spectrophotometry. In particular, ATO thin films coated with 5 sol-layers exhibit superb resistivity, good transmittance, and a superb figure of merit (FOM) compared to the other samples. The performance enhancement could be explained in two ways; (1) densification and thickness increase by sol coating and finally, (2) the dominant increase of the carrier concentration with small decrease of the electron mobility.","An, Ha-Rim;Kim, ChangYeoul;Oh, Sung-Tag;Ahn, Hyo-Jin",2014-01-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Effect of zirconia tape porosity on fluorapatite surface film formation by dip coating,"Thin fluorapatite (FA) layers on porous 3mol% yttria-partially stabilized zirconia (Y-PSZ) substrates have been fabricated by dipping porous zirconia tapes into aqueous 27.4vol% fluorapatite slurries. Two porous Y-PSZ tapes with different volume fraction of porosity were developed using an acrylic latex binder: tapes with 31.4vol% porosity were prepared using 16.6vol% starch as fugitive additive and those with 12.7vol% porosity were fabricated without starch. The influence of the porous structure of the tape surfaces, top and bottom, on the casting rate and consequently on the layer thickness formed on each surface was studied. Layers formed on the top and bottom surfaces of the tapes with 12.7 and 31.4vol% porosity were compared. The formation of a thin layer on the surface of the tape was governed by both liquid entrainment and slip casting mechanisms. The data for the FA layer formation were in good agreement with the slip casting model for immersion times>0. The casting rate at the top surface of both tapes was greater than that at the bottom surface. This difference was attributed to a greater porosity of the top surface with respect to that of the bottom one and was more pronounced for the tapes prepared with starch. Layers formed on the top surface were found to be about 55 and 32% thicker than those formed on the bottom surface for the tapes fabricated with and without starch, respectively. For the tapes prepared with starch, the greater porosity and number of smaller pores in the matrix of the top surface increased the casting rate and produced the thickest dip coated layers","Albano, María P.;Garrido, Liliana B.",2013-01-31,Ceramics International,"Porous ZrO2 tapes,Fluorapatite layer,Dip coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.05.089,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.05.089
Thermophysical performances of (Gd1-xYbx)2AlTaO7 oxides for high-temperature heat-insulation coating applications,"Newly developed (Gd1-xYbx)2AlTaO7 oxides for high-temperature heat-insulation coatings were prepared using a multi-step solid-state fritting method. The important features of synthesized oxides including phase composition, thermal conductivity and expansion performances were studied. It is investigated that the fabricated ceramics are confirmed to possess a sole pyrochlore crystal structure. Owing to the influence of the strain fields and mass fluctuations caused by Yb2O3 addition, thermal conductivities of (Gd1-xYbx)2AlTaO7 oxides are lower than that of Gd2AlTaO7 or Yb2AlTaO7, and the (Gd0.9Yb0.1)2AlTaO7 exhibits the lowest thermal expansion coefficient. Due to the synergic effects of the relatively high electro-negativity of Yb3+, decedent lattice order, and numerous oxygen vacancies, the thermal expansion coefficients increase gradually with increasing Yb2O3 content. The thermophysical performances of (Gd1-xYbx)2AlTaO7 oxides satisfy the conditions for high-temperature heat-insulation coatings.","Qunpeng, Duan;Kui, Lu;Hongsong, Zhang;Weiwei, Sang;Yongtao, Zhao;Xianfeng, Yan;An, Tang",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"Rare-earth tantalum-aluminium oxides,Thermal conductivity,Thermal expansion behaviour",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.179,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.179
Development of bioglass coating reinforced with hydroxyapatite whiskers on TiO2 nanotubes via electrophoretic deposition,"Considering the importance of coatings bonding to the substrate, electrophoretic deposition of bioglass coatings reinforced with hydroxyapatite whiskers was performed on anodized titanium substrate. Bioglass powders with both fine particle size (FBG) and coarse particle size (CBG) were used. It was found that Vickers microhardness and bioactivity of the coatings are not affected by titanium anodizing. The enhancement of 58% was obtained for the adhesion strength of FBG based coating due to the interlocking of titania nanotubes with fine bioglass particles entered the voids of nanotubes, which was only 32% for coarse bioglass particles. The microstructure of the coatings demonstrated no changes by anodizing the substrate, while the thickness of the coatings reduced significantly owing to the decreased deposition kinetics. The enhancement of the bactericidal effect and cellular behavior of the coatings indicated the positive impact of the underlaid nanotubes compared with bare titanium. The declined corrosion current density of the coated samples on nanotubes compared to titanium revealed the inhibitory effect of anodizing in terms of corrosion.","Khanmohammadi, Shirin;Ojaghi-Ilkhchi, Mehdi;Farrokhi-Rad, Morteza",2020-08-29,Ceramics International,"Anodic oxidation,Titania nanotube (TNT),Electrophoretic deposition (EPD),Bioglass,Hydroxyapatite",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.255,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.255
Magnetic photocatalysts of cenospheres coated with Fe3O4/TiO2 core/shell nanoparticles decorated with Ag nanopartilces,"A layer of magnetite Fe3O4 nanoparticles is first loaded onto the surfaces of cenospheres using ferric trichloride, ferrous chloride, and aqueous ammonia by a precipitation method, and then modified with silane coupling agent KH550. The modified Fe3O4 coated cenospheres are coated further with a film of anatase TiO2 nanoparticles under hydrothermal conditions, and finally decorated with Ag nanoparticles by electroless deposition. The surface morphology, chemical composition, crystalline structure, magnetic properties, and optical behaviors of cenosphere before and after treatments are determined by means of field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), and diffuse reflectance spectrum (DRS). The synthetic route for the formation of Ag decorated Fe3O4/TiO2 core/shell coating on cenosphere surfaces is established. The photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared cenospheres for the methylene blue degradation is measured under both ultraviolet and visible light irradiation. The results show that the Ag decorated Fe3O4/TiO2 coated cenospheres having a saturation magnetization of 21emug−1 are fabricated. After decoration with Ag the photocatalytic activity of the Fe3O4/TiO2 coated cenospheres is greatly improved under visible light irradiation because of the strong scattering and absorption properties of Ag nanoparticles. The silicon–oxygen interlayer between Fe3O4 core and TiO2 shell can be employed to prevent photodissolution of Fe3O4 during photocatalysis.","Zhan, Jianchao;Zhang, Hui;Zhu, Guoqing",2014-07-31,Ceramics International,"Cenosphere,Magnetite Fe3O4,Anatase TiO2,Ag nanoparticle,Photocatalytic activity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.01.069,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.01.069
Effect of bias voltage on microstructure and phase evolution of Cr–Mo–N coatings by an arc bonded sputter system,"Cr–Mo–N hard coatings were deposited on SKD11 and silicon wafer substrates at various substrate bias voltages by hybrid PVD consisting of arc ion plating and unbalanced magnetron sputtering. The results showed that the microstructure, phase evolution, and mechanical properties of the coatings were significantly altered at the different substrate bias voltage ranging from 0 to −400V. The X-ray diffraction analysis results revealed that most of the diffraction peaks originated from the Cr–N phase. These peaks were observed at lower positions with no substrate bias and were shifted to higher positions with increasing substrate bias power. The preferred orientation of the (200) plane became dominant accompanying the (220) plane as the bias voltage was increased. Maximum hardness of approximately 30GPa was obtained at a bias voltage of −200V. Additionally, wear test results reveal that the lowest coefficient of friction, between 0.4 and 0.5, was obtained from the Cr–Mo–N film formed at a bias voltage of −200V.","Jeong Heo, Su;Kim, Seong-Won;Yeo, In-Woong;Park, Sang-Jin;Oh, Yoon-Suk",2016-03-31,Ceramics International,"Hardness,Cr–Mo–N,Bias,Hybrid PVD,Solid solution",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.12.048,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.12.048
Effects of coupling agent on dielectric properties of PTFE based and Li2Mg3TiO6 filled composites,"In this study, Li2Mg3TiO6 (LMT) ceramic powders were synthesized by conventional solid state route, optimized using perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane (F8261) and then loaded into polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) emulsion. The effects of F8261 on the surface characteristics of LMT particles were investigated by analyzing SEM, XPS and contact angle. After the coating of F8261, the surface energy of LMT was decreased, leading to a more compatible microstructure with PTFE matrix than untreated LMT particles. As a comparison, the untreated and optimized LMT/PTFE composites were fabricated with different content of LMT (ranged from 30 wt % to 70 wt %). As compared to untreated samples, the substrates loaded with F8261 optimized LMT exhibited better properties with higher dielectric constant and lower dielectric loss. Furthermore, the dielectric constant of optimized LMT filled composites matched well with the values calculated by Effective medium theory (EMT). The temperature coefficient of dielectric constant (τ ε) of the composites were theoretically discussed. Finally, F8261 optimized LMT/PTFE composites performed prominent dielectric properties of ε r = 6.17, tan δ = 0.0019 and τ ε = 123 ppm/°C at high optimized LMT loading of 70 wt %.","Luo, Fuchuan;Tang, Bin;Fang, Zixuan;Yuan, Ying;Li, Hao;Zhang, Shuren",2019-11-30,Ceramics International,"PTFE,Li2Mg3TiO6,Microstructure,Water absorption,Dielectric properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.023
Residual stress control in CrAlN coatings deposited on Ti alloys,"In order to control residual stress of CrAlN coatings on Ti substrates, ~70nm CrAl interlayer was deposited at different temperatures. Residual stress and coatings’ structure were characterized by X-ray diffraction. Residual stress in the coatings was compressive and increased with CrAl interlayer deposition temperature. Residual stress in 1.5µm, 2µm and 2.6µm thick CrAlN films on TC21 with the interlayer deposited at 100°C (−47.43MPa, −25.57MPa and −855.77MPa, respectively) was smaller than with the interlayer deposited at 300°C (−1.39GPa, −1.95GPa and −1.62GPa, respectively). The coatings on the TC4 substrate showed the same trend (−1.02GPa, −389.91MPa and −1.03GPa for the interlayer deposited at 100°C, respectively, and −921.42MPa, −2.31GPa and −1.80GPa for the interlayer deposited at 100°C, respectively). Changing the interlayer deposition temperature can influence the coatings’ residual stress and crystal structure, and improve mechanical properties of the coatings. CrAlN deposition is a convenient and efficient way to improve mechanical properties of Ti alloys.","Bai, Yanyun;Xi, Yeting;Gao, Kewei;Yang, Huisheng;Pang, Xiaolu;Volinsky, Alex A.",2018-04-01,Ceramics International,"CrAlN coatings,Interlayer,Crystal microstructure,Residual stress,Mechanical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.037,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.037
Increased cycling stability of Li4Ti5O12-coated LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 as cathode material for lithium-ion batteries,"Li4Ti5O12 (LTO)-coated 5V spinel LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 as cathode was prepared by the sol–gel method followed by high-temperature calcinations. The structural and electrochemical properties of these cathodes were investigated using differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetery (TG), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and charge–discharge studies. TG–DTA shows that LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 spinel forms at about 400°C. XRD reveals that a substitutional compound LiMn2−x−y Ni x Ti y O4 can be formed when the coated content of LTO exceeds 3wt%. SEM exhibits that the coated LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 is covered with small particles that consist mainly of LTO. CV and dQ/dV versus voltage curves demonstrate that the modified material exhibits remarkably enhanced electrochemical reversibility and stability. The charge–discharge test indicates that 3wt% LTO-coated LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 has excellent fast charge–discharge performances. These results reveal that LTO-coated layer protects the surface of the active materials from HF in the electrolyte during electrochemical cycling. As a result, the surface-modification of LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 with LTO should be an effective way to improve the fast charge–discharge properties.","Zhu, Yan-Rong;Yi, Ting-Feng;Zhu, Rong-Sun;Zhou, An-Na",2013-04-30,Ceramics International,"LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4,Cathode material,Coating,Electrochemical performance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.09.088,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.09.088
Enhanced electromagnetic shielding property of C/SiC composites via electrophoretically-deposited CNTs onto SiC coating,"The study mainly discusses the improvement of electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) of carbon fiber-reinforced silicon carbide (C/SiC) composites by applying carbon nanotube/SiC (CNT/SiC) coating. Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) was used to deposit CNTs on C/SiC composite surface. SiC was infiltrated into open pores of CNT network by chemical vapor infiltration process. The EPD durations were set as 2, 5, 10, and 15 min and a systematic investigations have been conducted on composites under different EPD durations, such as scanning electron microscopy, electric conductivity, as well as EMI SE. Total EMI SE (SET) of composites increased as EPD duration increased. At EDP duration equal to 15 min, SET values were 42–43 dB. Such high values of SET demonstrate that our composites are able to hinder 99.992–99.993% of incident electromagnetic signal.","Yang, Kun;Mei, Hui;Han, Daoyang;Cheng, Laifei",2018-11-30,Ceramics International,"Carbon fiber/silicon carbide composites,Chemical vapor infiltration (CVI),Carbon nanotube/silicon carbide coating,Electrodeposition,Electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness (EMI SE)",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.001
Oxidation behaviour of plasma-sprayed ZrB2-SiC coatings,"Current study aimed at investigating oxidation behaviour of plasma-sprayed ZrB2-SiC coatings, which were deposited using different spray powers. Moreover, oxidation tests were carried out within temperature range of 400–1200 °C. Results from X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) suggested that ZrB2-SiC coatings had been markedly oxidized at 600 °C. Besides, oxidation behaviour of ZrB2-SiC block ceramics, which had achieved different densities using spark plasma sintering (SPS) and pressureless sintering (PS), was also studied to explain oxidation behaviour of plasma-sprayed ZrB2-SiC coatings. Results revealed that high-density ZrB2-SiC block ceramics displayed better oxidation resistance than low-density counterparts, indicating that unfavorable oxidation resistance of ZrB2-SiC coatings could be ascribed to low density, since there were more pores in ZrB2-SiC coatings, which provided channels for oxygen diffusion.","Feng, Xiaoqiang;Wang, Xin;Liu, Yuan;Guo, Yang;Zhang, Min;Zhang, Li;Jian, Xian;Yin, Liangjun;Xie, Jianliang;Deng, Longjiang",2019-02-01,Ceramics International,"Plasma spray,Zirconium diboride,Coating,Oxidation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.157,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.157
Thermal conductivity of air plasma sprayed yttrium heavily-doped lanthanum zirconate thermal barrier coatings,"The yttrium heavily doped La2Zr2O7 solid solutions coatings, with a Y to La molar ratio of 1:1, have been successfully prepared by air plasma spraying technique. The evolution of phase composition, phase structure and thermal conductivity of such coatings with annealing at 1300 °C has been investigated. The results show that, a single pyrochlore structure can be retained for coating after annealing up to 48 h, beyond which the fluorite phase begins to precipitate out. By comparing thermal conductivities to those undoped counterparts at a similar porosity level, we find a considerably flat thermal conductivity versus temperature (k-T) curve, suggesting the existence of a strong phonon scattering source, which is inferred as rattlers. In addition, after the segmentation of the fluorite phase, the thermal conductivity of corresponding coatings rises considerably, indicating that the fluorite phase has a higher thermal conductivity than that of pyrochlore phase. Moreover, while the as-sprayed coatings show a clear indication of radiative thermal conduction beyond 1000 °C, the thermal conductivity of annealed coatings do not show such an uprising trend after 1000 °C, suggesting that the radiative thermal conduction has been greatly suppressed. The reason is proposed as the formation of local dipoles due to local enrichment of certain elements influences the propagation of electromagnetic waves and thus suppresses the radiative thermal conduction.","Jiang, Di;Wang, Yanfei;Wang, Siqing;Liu, Rongjun;Han, Jing",2019-02-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,Atmospheric plasma spray,Yttrium heavily doped La2Zr2O7,Thermal conductivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.222,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.222
"Microstructural characterization and in vitro biological performances of Ag, Zn co-incorporated TiO2 coating","In order to improve antibacterial capability and cell biocompatibility of titanium (Ti), Ag nanoparticles (NPs) and a novel Zn source Na2Zn-EDTA (disodium zinc ethylenediaminetetraacetate tetrahydrate) were added in the electrolyte to fabricate Ag, Zn co-incorporated titania through micro-arc oxidation (MAO) method on metallic Ti substrate. Microstructural characterization reveals that the presence of both Ag NP clusters and micro-sized dicalcium phosphate dehydrate (DCPD) flakes on the surface of Ag, Zn co-incorporated TiO2 coating. Ag species are mainly present as metallic Ag whereas Zn species tend to exist as Zn2+ within titania. Further, corrosion resistance, antibacterial property and cell biocompatibility of the resultant coatings were assessed.

"Thermal diffusivity characterization of europium zirconate, cerate and hafnate","The following paper presents study on synthesis and thermal diffusivity of europium zirconate, cerate and hafnate as a new types of materials with pyrochlore or fluorite type of lattice, dedicated to replacement of conventional 8YSZ (yttria stabilized zirconia) in TBC (thermal barrier coatings) systems for aircraft gas turbines. All materials were synthesized via solid-state reaction (SSR) preceded preparation of powder mixtures (mechanical milling in ethanol). The feedstock powders were characterized by analysis of crystallite size, particle size distribution and phase composition. On the base of DSC measurements, the parameters of high temperature sintering were selected (1350 °C/2 h/15 MPa). Structural characterization of obtained materials inclusive analysis of morphology, chemical and phase composition of sinters was performed. Thermal diffusivity was measured in temperature range 25÷1400 °C by laser flash analysis (LFA). The obtained materials with pyrochlore and fluorite type of lattice exhibit lower thermal diffusivity compared to that of yttria-stabilized zirconia at high temperatures. In particular, the most promising material in view of insulating properties is Eu2Ce2O7, which exhibit much lower thermal diffusivity than Eu2Zr2O7 and Eu2Hf2O7, especially at temperature higher than 1000 °C. However, in temperature range 25–700 °C, europium hafnate and zirconate exhibit lower thermal diffusivity compared to that of europium cerate and 8YSZ.","Mikuśkiewicz, Marta;Moskal, Grzegorz;Migas, Damian;Stopyra, Michał",2019-02-01,Ceramics International,"TBC,Zirconates,Hafnates,Cerates,RE oxides,Thermal diffusivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.301,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.301
"Fabrication of high-quality alumina coating through novel, dual-particle aerosol deposition","High-quality alumina (Al2O3) coating has an extensive demand in the fields of optoelectronics, solar cells, and corrosion/impurity resistant coatings and cutting tools. The quality of alumina coating depends on its hardness and transparency. To obtain hard and highly transparent alumina coating, which is also a widely used ceramic material, a novel, aerosol deposition approach is presented in which the starting powder, used to fabricate Al2O3 ceramic coatings, is composed of angular and spherical Al2O3 particles. Films fabricated using angular:spherical Al2O3 particle mixtures with ratios of 10:0, 7:3, 5:5, 3:7, and 0:10, showed significant variation in surface roughness and microstructure. The dramatic morphology modulation of the 3:7 angular:spherical Al2O3 mixture film, resulting from the superposition hammering effect caused by the aerosol mixture, improved transmittance (84.7%) and hardness (13.6 GPa). Previous studies used high-energy approaches to optimize Al2O3 film properties. This dual-particle approach, however, produces Al2O3 film with excellent transmittance and hardness while achieving a fast coating speed (32 mm2 × μm/min) without additional thermal treatment. Our proposed approach provides a novel and energy efficient method to produce transparent Al2O3 films with superior durability.","Kim, Ik-Soo;Ko, Pil-Ju;Cho, Myung-Yeon;Lee, Yeon-Sook;Sohn, Hiesang;Park, Chulhwan;Shin, Weon Ho;Koo, Sang-Mo;Lee, Dong-Won;Oh, Jong-Min",2020-10-15,Ceramics International,"Aerosol deposition,Particle shape,Al2O3 coating,Superposition hammering effect",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.142,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.142
"Influence of Ti, Zr or Nb carbide adhesion layers on the adhesion, corrosion resistance and cell proliferation of titania doped hydroxyapatite to the Ti6Al4V alloy substrate, utilizable for orthopaedic implants","In the present paper, we study the enhancement of the adhesion between the titania doped hydroxyapatite coating and the Ti6Al4V alloy substrate by the addition of three different biocompatible carbides. The coatings were prepared by the magnetron sputtering technique. The addition of interlayer preserved the crystalline structure of hydroxyapatite. The morphology of the coating is influenced by the interlayer composition. The adhesion of the coatings was significantly improved by the interlayer, independent of it's composition. The best adhesion was found for the coatings with NbC interlayer, which also showed the best corrosion resistance in simulated body fluid at 37 °C, due to its flat surface grown without any distinct features. As expected, the results of the in vitro biological tests were almost similar for all coatings comprising an adhesion layer, as the same titania doped hydroxyapatite layer was on top. The experimental results revealed that the adhesion between Ti6Al4V and titania doped hydroxyapatite was improved by a hard metal carbide interlayer, without affecting the required biomedical properties such as good corrosion resistance, high proliferation level of osteoblast cells, and good gene expression levels.","Vladescu, Alina;Pruna, Vasile;Kulesza, Sawomir;Braic, Viorel;Titorencu, Irina;Bramowicz, Miroslaw;Gozdziejewska, Anna;Parau, Anca;Cotrut, Cosmin M.;Pana, Iulian;Dinu, Mihaela;Braic, Mariana",2019-02-01,Ceramics International,"B: Electron microscopy, interfaces, X-ray method,C: Corrosion,D: apatite,E: Biomedical applications",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.053,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.053
The dielectric and flexoelectric properties of Mg2+/K+ doped BST films,"BST thin films have been prepared on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates by spin-coating. Different concentrations of K+ and Mg2+ have been doped in BST thin films by uni-doping and by binary alternate doping to improve the dielectric and flexoelectric properties of the films. At an annealing temperature of 800 °C, the doped thin film crystallizes well, and no heterogeneous phase is formed. The film surface is smooth and dense, and it has no cracks. The dielectric constant of undoped BST film is 262, the dielectric loss is 0.044, and the equivalent piezoelectric constant is 3.077 × 105 μC/N. When the K+ doping concentration is 7 mol%, the dielectric constant of the BST film is 446, the dielectric loss is 0.031, and the equivalent piezoelectric constant is 4.539 × 105 μC/N. When the doping amount of Mg2+ is 5 mol%, the dielectric constant of the film is 401, the dielectric loss is 0.025, and the equivalent piezoelectric constant is 4.165 × 105 μC/N. BST films with Mg2+/K+ alternate doping have better dielectric and flexoelectric properties than uni-doped films.

Antimicrobial property and photocatalytic antibacterial mechanism of the TiO2-doped SiO2 hybrid materials under ultraviolet-light irradiation and visible-light irradiation,"In this study, an antibacterial hybrid material of TiO2-doped SiO2 (TiO2@SiO2) was prepared by hydrolysis, where the SiO2 carrier was synthesized by a sol–gel method. The as-prepared antibacterial materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller measurements and particle size analysis. The antibacterial effect of the prepared hybrid materials on Escherichia coli (E. coli) was investigated by the plate coating method. The presence of the Ti–O–Si bond between anatase-TiO2 and SiO2 was confirmed by the above characterization methods, which was beneficial to enhance the photocatalytic inactivation effect of E. coli under ultraviolet-light (UVA) irradiation and visible-light irradiation. With the increase in the TiO2 content from 1.5% to 4.4%, antibacterial activities were clearly enhanced under different types of light irradiation. For the optimum sample of 4.4%-TiO2@SiO2, antibacterial rates of 99.3% and 90.5% under UVA irradiation and visible-light irradiation were obtained, respectively. The antibacterial mechanism was demonstrated by fluorescence detection of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and SEM images of the changes in the bacterial morphology. Results revealed that the hybrid materials can generate ROS under not only UVA irradiation but also visible-light irradiation. A majority of the ROS migrated into the bacterial cells and caused the oxidative damage of cells. This is a crucial study for the photocatalytic inactivation mechanism of the bacteria under both UVA and visible-light irradiation.","Chen, Yifan;Tang, Xiaoning;Gao, Xin;Zhang, Bin;Luo, Yong;Yao, Xiyan",2019-08-15,Ceramics International,"TiO2-Doped SiO2 hybrid material,Photocatalytic antibacterial mechanism,Ti–O–Si bond,ROS fluorescence detection",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.054,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.054

However, most oxides can remain in ablation centre and serve as a coating at low temperature (1900 and 1800°C). Therefore, the TaC/SiC coated samples exhibited zero linear ablation rate and lower mass ablation rate.","Wang, Yong-jie;Li, He-jun;Fu, Qian-gang;Wu, Heng;Liu, Lei;Sun, Can",2013-01-31,Ceramics International,"B.

Fabrication and characterization of nanostructured hydroxyapatite coating on Mg-based alloy by high-velocity oxygen fuel spraying,"Magnesium alloys are currently being investigated in orthopedic applications due to their biodegradability and mechanical properties. However, sometimes these benefits are limited by their high corrosion rate in the physiological environment before healing of damaged bones. A large number of recent researches in this field have been dedicated to the control of magnesium corrosion rate by surface protection using new and advanced coatings. In this work, hydroxyapatite powders were coated on the anodized Mg-based alloy substrates by using high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) spraying. Increasing of the bioactivity and reduction of the released hydrogen gas during corrosion of the substrate were two main objects of this work. Phase formations were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). It was found that around 96% of the phases formed were hydroxyapatite. The amounts of hydrogen gas released during magnesium corrosion tests in the simulated body fluid (SBF) were measured to evaluate the corrosion resistance of the coated samples.

Innovative design and fabrication of generation IV nuclear fuel embedded with carbon nanotube,"The generation IV nuclear reactors Tri-structural isotropic (TRISO) fuel suffer failure due to internal pressure generation, corrosion by fission products and kernel migration under temperature gradient. An innovative fuel particle design was conceptualized and realized for the first time in literature by embedding multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) into porous buffer pyrolytic carbon layer (B.PyC) of TRISO particle to address above issues. MWCNT embedded in B.PyC was obtained by sequential coating using novel chemical vapor deposition reactor. Scanning electron microscopy shows ~15 μm uniformly dispersed MWCNT into B.PyC layer. Transmission electron microscopy and Raman Spectroscopy analysis of the deposited CNT revealed to be multi walled with good crystalline. Results of small angle scattering technique of the composite layer using X-ray and neutrons (SAXS/SANS) reveal better pore structure and could pave new vistas for TRISO fuel development.

Drug loaded electrospun polymer/ceramic composite nanofibrous coatings on titanium for implant related infections,"Developing an effective antibacterial surface with the help of drugs that prevent bacterial adhesion, colonization, and proliferation into the surrounding tissues is of great demand. Rifampicin (Rf) is effective antibiotic drug proved has proved its potential in treating bacteria in biofilms, especially against the microbes causing bone infections. Hydroxyapatite (HA), a biocompatible osteoconductive ceramic, has been verified to be a significant material for bioactivity enhancement. Electrospinning is an effective inexpensive method for incorporating nanoparticles into nanofibers with uniform distribution for the drug delivery system for tissue engineering applications. In the current study, for improving bioactivity and antibacterial properties, novel functional polycaprolactone (PCL) composite nanofibers loaded HA and Rf was developed and coated on titanium (Ti). Different characterization techniques such as SEM, EDS, XRD, FITR were used to analyze these PCL/Rf/HA nanocomposites. The results showed that the bioactivity and tensile strength of the composite scaffold increased with the addition of HA nanoparticles. In vitro bioactivity demonstrated that the PCL/HA/Rf composite nanofibers possess enhanced calcium deposition when compared to the pure sample. Cellular interactive responses such as adhesive and proliferation were evaluated using hFOB human fetal osteoblast cell lines. After 6 days of culturing, the cellular properties on Ti sample coated with PCL/HA/Rf was significantly improved. Antibacterial evaluations on the substrates showed that Rf-loaded PCL/HA fibers displayed >3 log reduction against S.aureus MRSA, and S.epidermidis bacterial strain and >2 log reduction against P.aeruginosa bacteria. In vitro drug release study shows initial burst release of Rf, followed by sustained released of 62% at the end of 32 days. The cell viability, adhesion, and proliferation evaluation suggest that the PCL/HA/Rf coated substrate possess good cytocompatibility. Further incorporation of Rf enhanced the antibacterial property of this nanofibrous scaffold.","Kranthi Kiran, A.

Microstructure of TiAlN and CrAlN coatings and cutting performance of coated silicon nitride inserts in cast iron turning,"Ti0.5Al0.5N and Cr0.3Al0.7N coatings were produced by cathodic arc evaporation (CAE) on silicon nitride cutting inserts. The microstructure and phase composition of the coatings were investigated by SEM and XRD, respectively. The hardness of the coatings was evaluated by applying micro-hardness tester. Turning tests were carried out on both uncoated and coated inserts in gray cast iron turning under dry environment. Wear behavior and cutting performance of the uncoated and coated inserts were investigated. The results showed that Ti0.5Al0.5N coating had higher hardness than Cr0.3Al0.7N coating owing to its smaller grain size. Cutting performance of the silicon nitride inserts was improved with the covering of Ti0.5Al0.5N and Cr0.3Al0.7N coatings with at least 2 times of the cutting life. No spalling was occurred after the cutting tests for both Ti0.5Al0.5N and Cr0.3Al0.7N coated inserts. Ti0.5Al0.5N coating performed better cutting performance and tool life than Cr0.3Al0.7N coating. The dominant wear mechanism of Ti0.5Al0.5N and Cr0.3Al0.7N coated inserts was abrasion with grooves on the worn faces.","Long, Ying;Zeng, Junjie;Yu, Donghai;Wu, Shanghua",2014-08-31,Ceramics International,"Cr0.3Al0.7N,Cutting performance,Silicon nitride cutting inserts,Ti0.5Al0.5N",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.02.083,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.02.083
Synthesis of Ti2AlC & Ti3AlC2 MAX phases by Arc-PVD using Ti–Al target in C2H2/Ar gas mixture and subsequent annealing,"MAX phases are appropriate protective coatings due to their unique properties such as excellent corrosion resistance. In this study, Ti–Al–C coatings with different percentages of Ti, Al and C were deposited on stainless steel and quartz glass substrates by Arc-PVD using two different Ti–Al alloy targets with (1:1) and (1:2) atomic ratios in C2H2/Ar atmosphere with various ratios (1/10, 1/4, 1/2). Then, the coated substrates were annealed in a vacuum furnace at different temperatures between 600 and 1000 °C. The results of XRD analysis indicated that Ti2AlC MAX phase is generated from 1Ti–2Al target, while Ti2AlC and Ti3AlC2 MAX phases are produced from 1Ti–1Al target by annealing at temperatures above 800 °C. Based on the results of this study, the best C2H2/Ar ratio in the Arc-PVD atmosphere for the synthesis of MAX phases was 1/4. Raman spectroscopy and XPS confirmed the presence of the MAX phases in the coatings. EDS analysis showed that the overall compositions occur within the regions in the ternary phase diagram in which the MAX phases are stable.","Mahmoudi, Zahra;Tabaian, Seyed Hadi;Rezaie, Hamid Reza;Mahboubi, Farzad;Ghazali, Mariyam Jameelah",2020-03-31,Ceramics International,"MAX phases,Ti2AlC,Ti3AlC2,Ti–Al–C,Coating,Arc-PVD,Annealing,Vacuum",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.235,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.235
Plant-mediated synthesis of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) using aloe vera and flaxseed extracts and evaluation of their cellular toxicities,"In this work, the synthesizing procedure of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs), which were observed with small ranged sizes, has been successfully performed by an ecological and green methodology. The report includes the synthesis and characterization of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles from iron salts in the aqueous extracts of (Aloe Vera leaves) and (Flaxseed) that had been achieved through a green co-precipitation technique. Although in accordance with the obtained X-ray diffraction (XRD), the composed samples have been pure Fe3O4 that contained a spinel structure, yet there have not been any phase changes in regards to the coating of herbal extracts. As it has been indicated by the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), the ordinary spheres of Fe3O4 particles, coated by herbal extracts, have been regular spheres that measured to be in sizes of about <50 nm and has matched the formula of Debye-Scherrer. Likewise, the herbal coating onto the Fe3O4 NPs has shown segments by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra. In addition, the Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM) has revealed the superparamagnetic properties of SPIONs. While considering the measured high saturated magnetization of aloe vera/SPIONs ( ~ 54 emu/g) and the flaxseed/SPIONs ( ~ 51 emu/g), the in vitro cytotoxicity assessments on MCF-7 Breast cancer cell line have reported the observation of a dose-dependent toxicity with low toxic effect in regards to concentrations below 4.7 μg/mL.","Rahmani, Reyhaneh;Gharanfoli, Mohsen;Gholamin, Mehran;Darroudi, Majid;Chamani, Jamshidkhan;Sadri, Kayvan;Hashemzadeh, Alireza",2020-02-15,Ceramics International,"Fe3O4,Nanoparticles,Aloe vera plant,Magnetic properties,Cellular toxicity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.005
Kinetics of growth of superhard boride layers during solid state diffusion of boron into titanium,"Solid state boriding of titanium is a very effective and inexpensive way to create surface layers that can impart high hardness and wear resistance. In this work, the growth kinetics of hard titanium boride layers created by the solid-state boron (B) diffusion through titanium (Ti) surface at various temperatures has been determined. The hard boride layers comprised of a monolithic titanium diboride (TiB2) layer at the top and a titanium boride (TiB) sub-layer that mostly consisted of TiB whiskers with high aspect-ratio growing normal to the surface. The structure and the crystallography of the layers were also confirmed by X-ray diffraction. Experimental results show that the growth rates of the TiB2 as well as the composite (TiB2+TiB) coating layers follow the parabolic kinetics. It is shown that the thickness development as a function of time can be predicted reasonably accurately, using the error function solutions for the two simultaneously growing boride layers developed in our previous work. The maximum degree of growth as dictated by the diffusivity of B in the boride phases was achieved using a solid state B powder pack in an ambient furnace atmosphere.","Sarma, B.;Tikekar, N.M.;Ravi Chandran, K.S.",2012-12-31,Ceramics International,"Titanium boride,Diffusion,Whiskers,Kinetics",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.05.077,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.05.077
Low-voltage ZnO varistor fabricated by the solution-coating method,"A novel solution nano-coating technique, by coating ZnO powder with a mixed solution of dopants, has been developed to produce high performance low-voltage ZnO varistors. The sintering temperature in the present route is about 50°C lower than that in the conventional oxide mixing route. The microstructure and electrical characteristics were examined by XRD, SEM and dc power supply and the results showed that the specimens prepared by the solution-coating route have bigger grain sizes, more evenly distributed intergranular phases, higher densities and nonlinearity coefficients, lower breakdown fields and leakage currents than those from the conventional oxide mixing route. The improved current–voltage properties are attributed to the excellent performance of the nano-composite ZnO powder and the advantages of the solution nano-coating technique.","Wang, Q.;Qin, Y.;Xu, G.J.;Chen, L.;Li, Y.;Duan, L.;Li, Z.X.;Li, Y.L.;Cui, P.",2008-09-30,Ceramics International,"C.

Fabrication and characterization of porous β-tricalcium phosphate scaffolds coated with alginate,"All porous materials have a common limitation which is lack of strength due to the porosity. In this study, two different methods have been used to produce porous β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) scaffolds: liquid-nitrogen freeze casting and a combination of the direct-foaming and sacrificial-template methods. Among these two methods, porous β-TCP scaffolds with acceptable pore size and compressive strength and defined pore-channel interconnectivity were successfully fabricated by the combined direct-foaming and sacrificial-template method. The average pore size of the scaffolds was in the range of 100–150µm and the porosity was around 70%. Coating with 4wt% alginate on porous β-TCP scaffolds led to higher compressive strength and low porosity. In order to make a chemical link between the β-TCP scaffolds and the alginate coating, silane coupling agent was used. Treated β-TCP scaffold showed improvements in compressive strength of up to 38% compared to the pure β-TCP scaffold and 11% compared to coated β-TCP scaffold.","Zairani, Nur Amyra Shazni;Jaafar, Mariatti;Ahmad, Nurazreena;Abdul Razak, Khairunisak",2016-03-31,Ceramics International,"Porous β-TCP scaffolds,Liquid-nitrogen freeze-casting method,Combination of direct-foaming and sacrificial-template methods",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.12.034,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.12.034
Thermal shock properties and failure mechanism of plasma sprayed Al2O3/TiO2 nanocomposite coatings,"Thermal shock properties and strengthening mechanics of Al2O3/TiO2 nanocomposite ceramic coatings deposited by plasma spraying technology were studied. The results indicate that the thermal shock properties of plasma sprayed nanocomposite ceramic coatings get ahead of that of conventional Al2O3 and Al2O3/TiO2 coatings. Presence of nanophase not only improves matching degrees of thermal propagation coefficient between ceramic coatings and bond-coats or substrates, but also lead cracks in top ceramic coatings to deviate, which could markedly prevent generation and propagation of thermal shock cracks. The study also shows that generation and propagation of thermal shock cracks locate at bond-coat/substrate interface. With the increase of thermal cycles, the thermal shock cracks propagate from bond-coat/TGO interface to top ceramic coat. The thermal shock temperature increase results in the reduction of thermal shock properties. The failure process of thermal shock includes crack initiation, propagation and coating spallation. Bond-coat/substrate interface is one of major factors which lead coatings to spallation failure.","Zhai, Chang-sheng;Wang, Jun;Li, Fei;Tao, Jing-chao;Yang, Yi;Sun, Bao-de",2005-12-31,Ceramics International,"Nanocompsite coatings,Plasma spraying technology,Thermal shock properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2004.09.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2004.09.009
Spark plasma sintering of a multilayer thermal barrier coating on Inconel 738 superalloy: Microstructural development and hot corrosion behavior,"In the present work, spark plasma sintering (SPS) process was employed to prepare a nanostructured yttria-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ) coating on a nickel-based superalloy (INCONEL 738) with functionally graded structure. A stack layer of INCONEL 738/NiCrAlY powder/Al foil/NiCrAlY+YSZ powder/YSZ powder was SPSed in a graphite die at an applied pressure of 40 MPa under an vacuum atmosphere (8Pa). The sintering temperature was ~1040°C. For comparison purpose, the air plasma spray (APS) technique was employed to prepare the thermal barrier coating (TBC). Microstructural studies by scanning electron microscopy showed that the SPSed coating was sound and free of interfacial cracks and large pores. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy determined a limited inter-diffusion between the layers. A significant improvement (~26%) in the Vickers micro-hardness was also measured. In order to examine the functionality of the coatings, hot corrosion test was performed at 1050°C in a molten bath of Na2SO4 and V2O5 (45 to 55 weight ratio). The results showed that spallation occurred after 12 and 20h for the SPSed and APS coatings, respectively.","Pakseresht, A.H.;Javadi, A.H.;Bahrami, M.;Khodabakhshi, F.;Simchi, A.",2016-02-01,Ceramics International,"Multilayer thermal barrier coating,Spark plasma sintering,Microstructure,Hot corrosion,Thermally grown oxide",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.11.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.11.008
"Composite coatings of lanthanum-doped fluor-hydroxyapatite and a layer of strontium titanate nanotubes: fabrication, bio-corrosion resistance, cytocompatibility and osteogenic differentiation","Poor bio-corrosion resistance and undesirable incomplete osseointegration restrict the application of hydroxyapatite (HA) as an implant coating material. In this study, a novel F-and-La co-substituted hydroxyapatite (FLaHA) coating, which was reinforced with strontium titanate nanotubes (STNTs), was applied on Ti substrates using a combination method of anodization, electrochemical deposition and hydrothermal treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the development of FLaHA/STNT coatings for improving the chemical stability and the mechanical and biological properties of Ti substrates. The STNT exhibits an evenly-distributed porous and latticed structure on Ti substrates that favours the infiltration of FLaHA crystals. Different characterisation techniques, such as x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy, have clearly confirmed the successful synthesis of STNT-FLaHA coatings that constitute oriented nanorod arrays. Isolated hexagonal nanorod grains, with diameters of 200–300 nm, that stand on a substrate provide a uniform morphology to the surface of electrodeposited thin films at micro-scales. The survival of the coatings was prolonged because of their good degradation resistance. Owing to the anchoring effect of the STNT layer, the adhesion strength of the FLaHA/STNT coating was 15.9 ± 5.4 MPa, which was two times higher than that of STNT-free HA coatings. The potentiodynamic polarisation curves and the Nyquist plot confirmed that the conversion coating significantly improved the bio-corrosion resistance of the Ti substrates in the SBF solution. Roughness and hydrophilicity of the control HA layer were even greater than those of the FLaHA/STNT coating. However, it provided better cell adhesion, spreading, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation for mouse pre-osteoblasts cells. That is, the FLaHA/STNT coating could enhance osteoconductivity by improving the cell-adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of osteoblast. Therefore, FLaHA/STNT nanocomposite coatings can be used as implant materials with multi-functional properties, such as good biocompatibility and high mechanical and corrosion-inhibiting properties.","Qiao, Haixia;Zou, Qingshuang;Yuan, Cuifang;Zhang, Xuejiao;Han, Shuguang;Wang, Zhenhui;Bu, Xiaopei;Tang, Hui;Huang, Yong",2018-10-01,Ceramics International,"HA coating,Lanthanum,Fluorine,SrTiO3 nanotubes,Osteoinductivity,Corrosion resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.090,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.090
"Effect of ytterbium doping concentration on structural, optical and photocatalytic properties of TiO2 thin films","Ytterbium (Yb) doped TiO2 thin films have been synthesized by sol-gel spin-coating technique. Films with different Yb concentrations such as 0.5, 1, 2, 4wt% were deposited and the impact of the dopant concentration on their physicochemical properties was evaluated. The films were characterized by X-Ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, UV–Vis transmittance spectroscopy and photoresponse. The results showed that the incorporation of ytterbium modified the properties of TiO2 films. The photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2:Yb films was determined using methylene blue (MB) as the generic pollutant. Compared to undoped TiO2, 1wt% Yb doped films exhibited higher photocatalytic activity toward MB degradation under UV light. When the amount of Yb dopant concentration was increased, there was a negative effect on the photosensitivity and photocatalysis.","Pérez, J.A. Borrego;Courel, Maykel;Pal, Mou;Delgado, F.

Microstructures and ablation properties of C/C−SiC−ZrC composites prepared using C/C skeletons with various densities,"Two-dimensional C/C–SiC–ZrC composites were prepared by isothermal chemical vapour infiltration combined with the reaction melt infiltration method using various density porous C/C skeletons. The microstructures, mechanical properties and ablation behaviour of the C/C–SiC–ZrC composites were systematically studied. The results showed that the strength and ablation resistance of C/C–SiC–ZrC composites improved with the increase of the C/C skeleton density. When the density of the C/C skeleton was 1.51g/cm3, the bending modulus and strength of the composites were 13.19GPa and 70.57MPa, respectively, and the linear and mass ablation rates of the composites ablated for 90s were 1.44×10−3 mm/s and 0.21×10−3 g/s, respectively. These properties were attributed to the introduction of ZrC and SiC into the matrix and the formation of a dense SiC–ZrC coating on the surface. The SiC–ZrC coating acted as an oxygen diffusion barrier for C/C composites and first reacted with oxygen to form an oxide protecting layer in the ablation environment.","Li, Zhaoqian;Li, Hejun;Zhang, Shouyang;Li, Wei;Wang, Jie",2013-09-30,Ceramics International,"C.

Design of three-layered struts in SiC reticulated porous ceramics for porous burner,"The three-layered struts within SiC reticulated porous ceramics (RPC) were designed to improve the thermal characteristics and thermal shock resistance of porous burner. The effects of strut structure and its composition on the flame stability limits, flame temperature and thermal damage resistance of porous burner were investigated. The results showed that three-layered struts consisted of continuous mullite coating, middle layer of SiC skeleton and inner layer of reaction-bonded mullite after sintering at 1450 °C. Compared to porous media with single layer, RPC with three-layered struts possessed the combined effects of high thermal conductivity and heat radiation because of its middle layer of SiC skeleton and in-situ formed mullite coating. The three-layered struts in porous media extended the flame stability limits and increased the flame temperature of porous burner. Furthermore, the formation of three-layered struts eliminated strut defects and formed continuous mullite coating, thereby significantly improving the oxidation resistance and thermal shock resistance of RPC, which increased the service life of porous burner.","Liang, Xiong;Li, Yawei;He, Zhu;Wang, Qinghu;Chen, Yuanyuan;Xu, Xuecheng;Li, Benwen;Aneziris, Christos G.",2019-05-31,Ceramics International,"SiC reticulated porous ceramic,Three-layered struts design,Flame stability limits,Oxidation resistance,Thermal shock resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.175,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.175

Self-oriented growth of β-Yb2Si2O7 and X1/X2-Yb2SiO5 coatings using laser chemical vapor deposition,"We demonstrated the self-oriented growth of ytterbium silicate films at high deposition rates using laser chemical vapor deposition (laser CVD). β-Yb2Si2O7, X1-Yb2SiO5, and X2-Yb2SiO5 phases preferred (001)β and (110)β, (100)X1 and (021)X2, and (221)X2 orientations, respectively. The self-oriented growth was associated with crystallographic features, namely the edge-sharing Yb–O polyhedral networks in each phase.

The formation of Y5V-type fine-grained ceramics based on spherical submicron BaZr0.1Ti0.9O3@Al2O3 particles,"To improve multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs), thinner dielectric layers are necessary. To achieve this goal, both grain size and uniformity of the MLCC particles must be controlled effectively. In this study, the core-shell structure of submicron-sized multi-function ceramic capacitors powder was synthesized using a novel precipitation route, which controls both dispersion and particle size of BaZr0.1Ti0.9O3 and BaZr0.1Ti0.9O3@Al2O3 particles. In this paper, we investigate the effect of Al2O3 coating on the microstructure and the dielectric properties of BaZr0.1Ti0.9O3.

Critical cracking thickness of calcium phosphates biomimetic coating: Verification via a Singh-Tirumkudulu model,"Despite the many advantages of biomimetic calcium phosphates (CaPs) coatings, there is a troublesome problem of low cohesion in the coatings. The low cohesion originates from the absence of bonding between CaP crystals, leading to cracks during drying of the coatings. In this study, based on a simplified Singh-Tirumkudulu model, the critical cracking thickness (CCT) of biomimetic CaPs coatings has been calculated. CaPs crystal size is the key factor influencing the CCT, except for the particle's shear modulus. Biomimetic CaPs coatings with different thickness have been prepared by soaking Ti substrates with a transition layer of TiO2 (rutile) in Dulbecco's phosphate buffer saline solution (DPBS) for 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks. The morphology, thickness, and whether cracks formed or not were evaluated by SEM. The simplified Singh and Tirumkudulu model has been verified in terms of our experimental results and data obtained from previous literatures. Via dedicated experiments and calculations it is concluded that a thickness of about approximately 2µm is the critical value for a crack-free CaPs coating given that the CaPs crystal size is smaller than 100nm. The model could be used in the future design of crack-free biomimetic coatings.","Xia, Wei;Fu, Le;Engqvist, Håkan",2017-12-01,Ceramics International,"Cracks,Calcium phosphate,Implant coating,Biomimetic",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.134,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.134
"Fracture and deformation mechanism of Ti(C,N)/TiAlSiN multilayer coating: FE modeling and experiments","Ti(C,N)/TiAlSiN multilayer coating was deposited on GTD450 using the Cathodic Arc PVD method to protect compressor blades from erosion damage. The fracture and deformation mechanisms of coating were investigated. To better observe fracture and deformation events and thus the need to apply high loads, Vickers microhardness test was performed and imprint diagonals were measured. Then, using SEM analysis, indent surfaces were investigated to observe crack initiation and deformation patterns at different loadings. It was found that crack initiated at the coating top surface (top surface of TiAlSiN layer) at a loading range of 250–500mN. Cross-section SEM images of indent surfaces at lower loads revealed shear sliding and radial cracking below the indenter in the coating-substrate interface (bottom surface of Ti(C,N) layer). To better understand coating fracture and deformation, a 3D FE model was used to determine stress distribution in the coating. FEM results showed that maximum Von Mises stresses occur beneath the indenter and its edges, causing shear sliding to take place. Also, maximum principal stresses at lower loads take place beneath the indenter at the coating-substrate interface. As load increases, the maximum principal stress zone changes and is transferred to the coating top surface. Maximum principal stress was produced during the unloading process at the coating top surface or median plane and may cause lateral cracking. Experimental and FEM results were in good agreement.","Azizpour, A.;Poursaeidi, E.",2017-02-01,Ceramics International,"A.Films,B.Failure analysis,D.Nitrides,C.Fracture",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.141,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.141
Effect of Sr and Ca dopants on oxidation and electrical properties of lanthanum chromite-coated AISI 430 stainless steel for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect application,"Lanthanum chromite coating occupies a noticeable position as a ceramic coating on metallic interconnects in solid oxide fuel cells because of its excellent electrical conductivity, high oxidation resistance and desirable chemical stability in both oxidizing and reducing atmospheres. In the present work, a sol–gel process based on the dip-coating technique was used to prepare dense and uniform coatings on metallic alloy for interconnect application (AISI 430 type). The effect of strontium and calcium doping into lanthanum chromite structure on electrical conductivity and oxidation behavior of the coated sample has been investigated. The oxidation behavior was evaluated by cyclic oxidation test at 800°C in lab air. In addition, the area specific resistance (ASR) of the coated and uncoated samples after long-term oxidation was measured through a two-point, four-wire probe method. It was found that, for the coated sample, when compared to the bare metallic one, the addition of Ca into lanthanum chromite coating drastically lowered the oxidation rate and electrical resistance by approximately 2 and 6 times, respectively.","Rashtchi, Hamed;Sani, Mohammad Ali Faghihi;Dayaghi, Amir Masoud",2013-09-30,Ceramics International,"A.

Synthesis of a novel Ni–B/YSZ metal-ceramic composite coating via single-step electrodeposition at different current density,"A novel metal-ceramic composite coating of Ni–B/YSZ has been synthesized via single-step electrodeposition process at different current density. Influences of electrodeposition current density on its structure (morphology, phase structure, roughness, crystallite size), composition (YSZ content) and properties (hardness, corrosion resistance) were evaluated. These coatings are compact, without cracks, showing nodular or cauliflower-like morphology in a nanocrystalline structure with crystallite size about 9–11 nm. Ni (111) plane was the only preferred orientation and is independent of current density. Current density affects YSZ particle content in coating, nodule size, hardness, and anti-corrosion properties. The roughness of these coatings is about 67–71 nm (Sa) dependent on current density, and low current density could slightly reduce the roughness. The doped YSZ particles changed Ni–B matrix to a crystalline structure and enhanced the hardness. The maximum hardness was 920.5 HV at 5 A dm-2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results indicated that the best corrosion-resistant properties combined electrochemical stability (long service life) of the nanocrystalline coating could be obtained at 4 A dm-2.

Protectiveness of Pt and Gd2Zr2O7 layers on EB-PVD YSZ thermal barrier coatings against calcium–magnesium–alumina–silicate (CMAS) attack,"Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are susceptible to degradation caused by environmental deposits mainly composed of calcium–magnesium–aluminum–silicon (CMAS). In this work, the degradation of electron beam physical vapour deposition (EB-PVD) yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) TBC due to CMAS attack was investigated. To protect the YSZ coating, a Pt film and a Gd2Zr2O7 (GZO) layer were deposited onto the YSZ coating surface by electroplating and EB-PVD, respectively. The coatings were heat treated at 1250°C for 4h with CMAS deposits, and their microstructure and chemical composition after CMAS attack were investigated. Electroplating a dense and defect-free Pt film on YSZ coating could provide effective protection from CMAS attack, but EB-PVD GZO coating was unable to prevent molten CMAS infiltration, mainly due to the large inter-columnar gaps. The associated mechanisms were discussed in detail.","Wang, Lu;Guo, Lei;Li, Zhuomin;Peng, Hui;Ma, Yue;Gong, Shengkai;Guo, Hongbo",2015-11-30,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs),Yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ),Calcium–magnesium–aluminum–silicon (CMAS),Pt film,Gd2Zr2O7 layer",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.05.128,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.05.128
Plasma spray: Study of the coating generation,"A plasma sprayed coating is built up particle by particle, resulting in a coating with a layered structure that is highly anisotropic. The spray parameters affect certain factors of the coating, such as the size and distribution of porosity, oxide content, residual stresses, macro and microcracks, factors which have an important influence on the performance and eventual failure of the coating. Many works (modelling and measurements) have been devoted to the particles in flight and how these parameters are influenced by the plasma jets and particle injection macroscopic parameters. However, there is a shortage of published information on the way the particles spread upon impact and solidify on the substrate or the previously deposited layers and how these phenomena are connected to the deposit microstructure. This paper was concerned with expanding our knowledge in this field by concentrating on the following: • • modelling of deformation and solidification of a droplet on a substrate; • • measurement of the splat formation and cooling; • • experimental results and comparison with models.","Fauchais, P.;Vardelle, M.;Vardelle, A.;Bianchi, L.",1996-12-31,Ceramics International, ,10.1016/0272-8842(95)00106-9,https://doi.org/10.1016/0272-8842(95)00106-9
The synthesis of micro and nano WO3 powders under the sparks of plasma electrolytic oxidation of Al in a tungstate electrolyte,"Plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) is commonly known as a coating technique. However, the present study shows that PEO of pure Al in 10 g l−1 Na2WO4·2H2O leads to the synthesis of micro and nano sized powders of WO3. The as-synthesized WO3 powders have been characterized by SEM, TEM and photocatalytic tests. The plasma discharges during the PEO process have been investigated by real-time imaging and spectrographic method. The energetic features of the single discharge at different stages of PEO have been evaluated. It was suggested that the electrolyte species were directly decomposed into tungsten oxides within the discharge channels and then the oxides re-entered the electrolyte due to the lower melting and boiling points of WO3, and more importantly, its tendency of sublimation.","Zhan, Tingyan;Tu, Wenbin;Cheng, Yulin;Han, Junxiang;Su, Bin;Cheng, Yingliang",2018-06-15,Ceramics International,"Plasma electrolytic oxidation,WO3,Al,Micro and nano sized powders,Sublimation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.054,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.054
Atmospheric pressure chemical vapor infiltration of a titanium carbide interphase coating on carbon fiber,"Thin film coatings of titanium carbide (TiC) were deposited onto carbon fibers via atmospheric pressure chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) using TiCl4, CH4, and H2 gases. Three CVI parameters were optimized to obtain high quality coatings: temperature, total gas flow rate, and H2/CH4 flow ratio. Scanning electron microscopy was used to assess the quality and morphology of the coatings, including the roughness, uniformity, fiber coverage, and fiber adhesion. The temperature was optimized to 900 °C, which yielded complete fiber coverage with minimal fiber bridging and good adhesion. Minimizing the total gas flow rate to 37.5 standard cubic centimeters per minute reduced the roughness of the TiC coating. Finally, maximizing the ratio of H2/CH4 to 4:1 was optimal for all coating qualities. Selected area electron diffraction confirmed the presence of crystalline TiC. A combination of transmission electron microscopy and fiber tow tensile testing revealed that the outer layer of carbon fiber becomes damaged by the CVI process, causing loss of strength. To circumvent this surface degradation, it is necessary to protect the fibers with a pyrolytic carbon interphase coating before depositing TiC. This method of depositing TiC onto carbon fibers proves to be competitive in terms of coating quality, deposition temperature, reaction time, and fiber strength compared to other TiC deposition methods including reactive-CVI and molten salt synthesis.","Monteleone, Chris;Poges, Shannon;Petroski, Kenneth;Kerns, Peter;Tobin, Zachary;Policandriotes, Tod;Suib, Steven L.",2020-07-31,Ceramics International,"Chemical vapor infiltration,Carbides,Films,Fibres",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.043,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.043
The effects of pulse electrodeposition parameters on morphology and formation of dual-layer Si-doped calcium phosphate coating on AZ31 alloy,"Controlling the corrosion rate of magnesium alloys in vivo to match the bone repair is crucially important for application as biodegradable orthopedic implants. To solve this challenge, a Si-doped Ca–P coating with a novel dual-layer structure was deposited on AZ31 alloy substrate by pulse electrodeposition. The morphology, composition and formation of dual-layer coating were believed to be determined by pulse electrodeposition parameters, thus the deposition time, temperature, duty cycle, pH value of the electrolyte and the standing duration of mixed electrolyte were regulated to seek possible influences and mechanism on the coating formation. Weight gain and pH monitoring tests were also used to evaluate the performance of coating under the varied parameters. The results indicated that deposition temperature and time remarkably influenced the morphology, homogeneity and crystallinity of Ca–P coating. A uniform and compact coating with better degradation performance was obtained at 60°C with deposition time of 40min. The shorter standing duration of the electrolyte lead to an incomplete coating and uneven distribution of Si contents. The two coupled deposition models contributed to this dual-layer structure of Si-doped Ca–P coating and possible formation mechanism was proposed.","Wan, Peng;Qiu, Xun;Tan, LiLi;Fan, XinMin;Yang, Ke",2015-01-31,Ceramics International,"Pulse electrodeposition,Dual-layer structure,Silicon,Calcium phosphate coating,AZ31 magnesium alloy",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.09.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.09.003
Design and synthesis of a novel ceramic coating-like tool material,"A novel ceramic coating-like (CCL) structure was proposed for preparing a potential ceramic cutting tool material. The influence of critical factors, including the material composition, composition content and surface layer thickness, on the residual stress was analyzed by the finite element method (FEM). Under the condition of the optimized parameters, the compressive stress generated on the surface layer of the CCL tool material ranged from −163 MPa to −248 MPa. Based on the obtained results, a (Ti,W)C/Al2O3+SiC CCL tool material was prepared by vacuum hot-pressing sintering, indicating the residual compressive stress (−122.3 MPa) of the surface layer. Compared with the performance of homogeneous cermet materials, the surface hardness and flexural strength of the CCL tool materials were increased by 46.58% and 37.76%, respectively. Moreover, the SEM imaging results of the sample surface and fracture morphology and the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis results showed that the dense ceramic surface and phase interfacial transition layer were formed with a uniform gradient distribution and without defects.","Song, Yingjie;Yi, Mingdong;Zhang, Guoqiang;Li, Depeng;Xiao, Guangchun;Zhang, Jingjie;Chen, Zhaoqiang;Xu, Chonghai",2020-10-02,Ceramics International,"Ceramic coating-like,Tool material,Compressive stress,Hot-pressing",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.299,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.299
Effect of Yb2SiO5 addition on the physical and mechanical properties of sintered mullite ceramic as an environmental barrier coating material,"In this study, ytterbium monosilicate (Yb2SiO5)-added sintered mullite ceramics are prepared as candidate materials for environmental barrier coatings (EBCs). The effect of adding Yb2SiO5 on the physical and mechanical properties of the sintered mullite ceramics is investigated. The Yb2O3–SiO2–Al2O3 ternary phase diagram indicates that adding Yb2SiO5 to the mullite goes beyond simply mixing; instead, liquid sintering occurs. Therefore, when we add Yb2SiO5 to the mullite, the sintered body possesses a denser microstructure and faster densification rate than does pure mullite. The density rapidly increases with the addition of 6wt% Yb2SiO5 in the mullite, and almost full densifications are achieved with the addition of 12wt% and 18wt% Yb2SiO5. In this study, mullite ceramic that contains 12wt% Yb2SiO5 exhibits the smallest plastic deformation and the highest elastic modulus among ceramics containing 6, 12, and 18wt% Yb2SiO5, according to Hertzian indentation results. The results suggest that 12wt% Yb2SiO5-doped mullite may be expected to act as a potential EBC material based on its excellent elastic properties, dense microstructure, and appropriate coefficient of thermal expansion.","Feng, Fan-Jie;Jang, Byung-Koog;Park, Ji Yeon;Lee, Kee Sung",2016-11-01,Ceramics International,"Mullite,Silicate,Environmental barrier coatings,Mechanical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.149,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.149
Preparation and performance of ZrAlN anti-reflective coatings for low-emissivity glasses,"Hard and optically selective films are useful for low-emissivity applications and the surface layer of optical elements. In this paper, ZrAlN films were prepared by RF magnetron sputtering on glass substrates at room temperature under different power and gas flow rate. Microstructure, optical properties, chemical compositions and tribological properties of the coatings were investigated and the results indicate that the ZrAlN coatings, prepared with a nitrogen flow rate of 6 sccm, target power of 110W for both Al and Zr, can give an excellent visible light transmittance that allows 90% of light in the range of 400–600nm to transfer through the glass and films. Especially, the Transmittance of the ZrAlN is 93.4% at the wavelength of 550nm which is higher than glass. The emissivity of ZrAlN coating is about 0.74, much lower than bare glass. The coatings maintain the optical properties even under salt spray test for 336h. the results proved that the ZrAlN films are excellent anti-reflective coatings with superior mechanical property and high corrosion resistance, it can be used in low-emissivity glasses and some other optical components.","Su, Jun;Yin, Lingyi;Qin, Lilu;Ma, Niu;Huang, Jiamu",2017-12-01,Ceramics International,"ZrAlN,Anti-reflective coating,Low-emissivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.105,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.105
Effect of Ti amount on wear and corrosion properties of Ti-doped Al2O3 nanocomposite ceramic coated CP titanium implant material,"Al2O3 and Ti-doped Al2O3 nanocomposite ceramic coatings were prepared by using a sol-gel dip-coating process. Corrosion and wear resistance of Al2O3 ceramic coatings in relation to Ti amount were carried out using pin-on-disk tribotester, potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Surface characterizations before and after the corrosion and wear tests were investigated by the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) and hardness analysis. The results of corrosion and wear tests exhibited that the corrosion and wear resistance of nanocomposite ceramic coatings became better than uncoated samples. Also, corrosion and wear resistance of nanocomposite ceramic coatings improved with Ti doping content increased.","Çomaklı, O.;Yazıcı, M.;Yetim, T.;Yetim, A.F.;Çelik, A.",2018-05-31,Ceramics International,"Sol-gel,Al2O3 nanocomposite ceramic coating,Ti-doping,Corrosion,Wear",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.046,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.046
"Preparation, cell response and apatite-forming ability of microarc oxidized coatings containing Si, Ca and Na on titanium","The formation, cell response and apatite-forming ability of novel TiO2-based coatings containing Si, Ca and Na (SCN) on titanium formed by microarc oxidation (MAO) were investigated. The oxidation time has obvious effect on the surface morphology and SCN elements concentrations of the MAO coatings. The current results indicated that the MAO coatings containing SCN possess good apatite-forming ability, which is highly dependent on the applied voltage. And high applied voltage could facilitate for improving the apatite-forming ability of the MAO coatings due to the introduction of a large quantity of SCN elements. It was firstly observed that the induced biomimetic apatite could grow into the pores of MAO coatings, which could facilitate for the fixation of apatite layer. The A-type slightly substituted carbonated-HA and B-type slightly substituted carbonated-HA with HPO4 2− group were obtained after immersion of the MAO coatings in a simulated body fluid. As expected, the MAO coatings show good biocompatibility according to the cells proliferation.","cheng, Su;Wei, Daqing;Zhou, Yu;Guo, Haifeng",2011-09-30,Ceramics International,"D.

Thermophysical and thermochemical properties of new thermal barrier materials based on Dy2O3–Y2O3 co-doped zirconia,"Dy2O3–Y2O3 co-doped ZrO2 would potentially exhibit lower thermal conductivity and higher coefficient of thermal expansion, which is a promising ceramic thermal barrier coating material for aero-gas turbines and high temperature applications in metallurgical and chemical industry. In this study, Dy2O3–Y2O3 co-doped ZrO2 ceramics were prepared using solid state reaction methods. Dy0.5Zr0.5O1.75 and Dy0.25Y0.25Zr0.5O1.75 consist of pure cubic fluorite phase, whereas both Dy0.06Y0.072Zr0.868O1.934 and Dy0.02Y0.075Zr0.905O1.953 have tetragonal and cubic composite phases. The influence of the chemical composition on coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and the thermal conductivity was investigated by varying the content of rare earth dopant. Dy0.06Y0.072Zr0.868O1.934 exhibited a lower thermal conductivity and higher coefficient of thermal expansion as compared with standard 8wt% Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 which is used in conventional thermal barrier coatings. The compatibility between the thermally grown oxide that consists of Al2O3 and the new compositions is critical to ensure the durability of thermal barrier coatings. Hence, the compatibility between Al2O3 and Dy2O3–Y2O3 co-doped YSZ was investigated by mixing two types of powders and eventually sintered at 1300°C. Dy0.06Y0.072Zr0.868O1.934 is compatible with Al2O3, whereas YAlO3 and Dy3Al2(AlO4)3 were formed when Dy0.25Y0.25Zr0.5O1.75 and Al2O3 were mixed and sintered.","Qu, Liu;Choy, Kwang-Leong",2014-09-30,Ceramics International,"C.

Optimization of microstructure and properties of composite coatings by laser cladding on titanium alloy,"Recently, the current technological progress in developing laser cladding technology has brought new approaches in surface modification of titanium alloys. Herein, composite coatings were fabricated by the laser cladding process on Ti811 alloys using a coaxial powder feeding method. A comprehensive study was performed on the laser energy density (Led) and CeO2 content on the structure distribution, microhardness and tribological properties of the coatings. In addition, the growth mechanism of the TiC–TiB2 structure was studied based on the Bramfitt two-dimensional lattice mismatch theory. The results indicated that the phase composition of the coating mainly contained TiC, TiB2, Ti2Ni, and α-Ti. The optimized coating contributed to uniform microstructure distribution and fine grain size when Led was 45 J/mm2 and the CeO2 content was 2 wt%, playing an important role in the best forming quality and properties. Besides, the high matching degree of an interface between TiC (111) and TiB2 (0001) contributed to the TiC–TiB2 composite structure, which positively influenced the grain size and distribution of TiC. The microhardness and wear resistance of the 2Ce coating was dramatically enhanced due to the fine grain strengthening and dispersion strengthening effects of CeO2, contributing directly to generate a high average hardness of 811.67 HV0.5 with a lower friction coefficient.","Liu, Ya'nan;Yang, Lijun;Yang, Xuejiao;Zhang, Tiangang;Sun, Ronglu",2020-09-11,Ceramics International,"Laser cladding,Ti811 alloy,CeO2,Optimization,Microstructure,Wear resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.063,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.063
Development of highly conductive and transparent copper doped zinc oxide thin films via 2-methoxyethanol modified sol–gel dip-coating technique,Nanocrystalline copper doped zinc oxide thin films were prepared via a modified 2-methoxyethanol sol–gel dip-coating technique at various concentrations of copper in the range 0–5wt%. The X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the copper doped zinc oxide hexagonal wurtzite structure. The copper ions interstitially substitute zinc ions in the hexagonal structure which resulted in the decrease of the crystallite size from 25nm to 16nm. A decrease in the lattice parameters was observed up to 2wt% of copper ions followed by an increase. Scanning electron microscopy showed a homogenous distribution of the prepared films along the glass substrates. Energy dispersive spectroscopy confirmed the stoichiometry and high purity of the prepared films. The optimum optical band gap was achieved at 2wt% of the copper ion concentration. The prepared films showed a high transparency in the visible region with an average value of 89%. The I–V characteristics showed Ohmic behavior up to 3V. The electrical resistivity showed a lowest value (0.2Ωcm) for the film doped with 2wt% of copper.,"Al-Khanbashi, Hibah A.;Shirbeeny, W.;Al-Ghamdi, A.A.;Bronstein, Lyudmila M.;Mahmoud, Waleed E.",2014-01-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Low-temperature pressureless sintering of Al2O3-SiC-Ni nanocermets in air environment,"This paper introduces a simplified method for low-temperature pressureless sintering of Al2O3-Ni-SiC nanocermets in air environment. In this method, a thin and continuous Ni shell was coated on the surface of Al2O3 particles using electroless deposition method. The composite powders were subsequently compressed to prepare bulk specimens. By preventing the ceramic particles from direct contact during the densification of green specimens, sintering temperature of cermet materials was reduced from that of Al2O3 (> 1400 °C) to the range of Ni solid-phase sintering temperature. Furthermore, dissolution of a low amount of phosphorus in the composition of Ni coatings caused the further decrease of the sintering temperature to 800 °C. At such low temperatures, pressureless sintering of the cermets in the air environment was successfully performed instead of the common hot pressing process in a reducing atmosphere. Optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterizations indicated that the microstructure of such sintered samples consists of a continuous Ni network surrounding Al2O3 grains, without any structural defects or Ni oxidation. Furthermore, mechanical properties of the cermet materials were improved through reinforcement of the continuous Ni network by different amounts of SiC nanoparticles. The results showed that Al2O3-Ni-5 wt% SiC nanocermets sintered at 800 °C obtain the highest compressive strength of 242.5 MPa, hardness of 56.8 RA, and the lowest wear weight loss of 0.04 mg/m.","Firoozbakht, D.;Sajjadi, S.A.;Beygi, H.;Sazegaran, H.",2018-10-15,Ceramics International,"A.

Hollow mesoporous zirconia nanocontainers for storing and controlled releasing of corrosion inhibitors,"Release of inhibitor molecules on demand from nanocontainers dispersed in a passive barrier coatings offer great promise for active corrosion protection coatings of metals and alloys with self healing ability. In the present study, hollow mesoporous zirconia nanospheres (hm-ZrO2) with a hollow core/porous shell structure are proposed as effective containers for corrosion inhibitor loading and releasing. Hollow mesoporous zirconia nanocontainers were synthesized using solid silica nanoparticles as templates. The morphology and phase of zirconia nanocontainers were studied using high resolution transmission electron microscopy and laser Raman spectroscopy. 2-Mercaptobenzothiazole was selected as the model corrosion inhibitor for the encapsulation. The storage and release properties of hm-ZrO2 were investigated using UV–visible spectroscopy. The encapsulation efficiency of hm-ZrO2 was 63% and we observed a faster and higher release of 2-MBT from hm-ZrO2 when the pH was shifted from neutral value.","Chenan, Arunchandran;Ramya, S.;George, R.P.;Kamachi Mudali, U.",2014-08-31,Ceramics International,"A.

A duplex coating composed of electrophoretic deposited graphene oxide inner-layer and electrodeposited graphene oxide/Mg substituted hydroxyapatite outer-layer on carbon/carbon composites for biomedical application,"A duplex coating composed of electrophoretic deposited graphene oxide (GO) inner-layer and electrodeposited GO/Mg substituted hydroxyapatite (MH) outer-layer was prepared on carbon/carbon composites (CC). The morphology and microstructure of GO-GO/MH coating were researched by Scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The bonding strength between GO-GO/MH coating and CC substrate was investigated by shear test. The in-vitro bioactivity of GO-GO/MH coating was analyzed by simulated body fluid (SBF) immersion test. The results demonstrated that electrophoretic deposited GO inner-layer was successfully introduced on CC and could serve as an interlayer between CC and following electrodeposited GO/MH outer-layer. GO/MH outer-layer presented a flake morphology with 150–250 nm in thickness and 1.5–2.5 µm in width, exhibiting porous three-dimensional networks structure uniformly. The shear test showed that the bonding strength between the duplex coating and CC reached 7.4 MPa, which was 80.49% higher than that of single-layered MH coating without GO. The duplex coating could induce the formation of flocculent and chapped apatite after SBF immersion, which demonstrated the in-vitro bioactivity of the duplex coating. These results suggested that GO-GO/MH coating might be a promising candidate in the field of biomaterials, especially for implant coatings.","Zhang, Leilei;Zhu, Feiyan;Li, Hejun;Zhao, Fei;Li, Shaoxian",2018-12-01,Ceramics International,"Graphene oxide,Mg substituted hydroxyapatite,Carbon/carbon composite,Coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.169,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.169
Room-temperature UV-ozone assisted solution process for zirconium oxide films with high dielectric properties,"A facile, low-cost, and room-temperature UV-ozone (UVO) assisted solution process was employed to prepare zirconium oxide (ZrOx) films with high dielectric properties. ZrOx films were deposited by a simple spin-coating of zirconium acetylacetonate (ZrAcAc) precursor in the environment-friendly solvent of ethanol. The smooth and amorphous ZrOx films by UVO exhibit average visible transmittances over 90% and energy bandgap of 5.7eV. Low leakage current of 6.0 × 10−8 A/cm2 at 3MV/cm and high dielectric constant of 13 (100Hz) were achieved for ZrOx dielectrics at the nearly room temperature. Moreover, a fully room-temperature solution-processed oxide thin films transistor (TFT) with UVO assisted ZrOx dielectric films achieved acceptable performances, such as a low operating voltage of 3V, high carrier mobility of 1.65cm2 V−1 s−1, and on/off current ratio about 104–105. Our work indicates that simple room-temperature UVO is highly potential for low-temperature, solution-processed and high-performance oxide films and devices.","Dong, Xin;Xia, Guodong;Zhang, Qian;Li, Lubin;Gong, Hongyu;Bi, Jianqiang;Wang, Sumei",2017-12-01,Ceramics International,"High-k dielectrics,Metal oxides,Sol–gel,Thin-film transistor,Low-temperature,Photochemical deposition",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.055,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.055
Sb-doped SnO2 (ATO) hollow submicron spheres for solar heat insulation coating,"Antimony doped Tin Oxide (ATO) hollow submicron spheres were synthesized with a carbon ball template using the hydrothermal method, and compared to commercial nano-ATOs that differed in particle size. To study the thermal insulation performance and the mechanism of different ATOs, their morphology, crystalline structure and microstructure were examined using XRD, SEM and HRTEM. Meanwhile, the optical and thermal characteristics of the different ATOs, including absorption, reflectance, thermal conductivity, infrared emissivity (8–14 μm), and specific heat capacity, were also measured. Silicone acrylic emulsion coatings containing different dosages of ATO were then prepared, and their UV–Vis–NIR transmittance and solar heat shielding performances were tested. ATO hollow submicron spheres showed a thermal insulation performance comparable to that of nano-ATO, but their main respective thermal insulation mechanism was different. ATO hollow submicron spheres primarily relied on better particle dispersion, lower thermal conductivity, higher specific heat capacity and higher infrared emissivity. The 50 nm ATO absorbed the least solar heat but reflected the most light, while 100 nm ATO showed the opposite behavior. Both nano-ATOs had better transmittance in the visible light range but relatively low transmittance in the ultraviolet and infrared range. The results of this study indicate that ATO hollow submicron spheres are promising materials equivalent to nano-spheres that can be applied as a coating for energy conservation.","Wang, Minjia;Bu, Jinchao;Xu, Yang;Liu, Yuan;Yang, Yunfang",2020-08-19,Ceramics International,"Hollow structure,ATO,Submicron,Coating,Solar heat shielding",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.162,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.162
Fabrication and thermal shock behavior of Si3N4 whiskers toughened γ-Y2Si2O7 coating on porous Si3N4 ceramics,"In order to prevent water from entering the porous Si3N4 ceramics, α-Si3N4 whiskers toughened γ-Y2Si2O7 coatings were prepared by a liquid infiltration and filling method. Effects of α-Si3N4 whiskers content on the microstructure, waterproof performance, mechanical properties and thermal shock behavior of the ceramic coatings were systematically studied in this paper. Results indicated that the addition of whiskers could effectively improve the performance of the coatings under thermal shock due to the toughening mechanism of whiskers including crack deflection, whisker bridging, whisker pulling out and other energy dissipation processes. The coating with a α-Si3N4 whisker/γ-Y2Si2O7 mass ratio of 1/9 possessed a flat, dense and defect-free surface microstructure. After five thermal cycles under a thermal shock temperature difference of 1200 °C, water absorption of the coating increased slightly from ~3.2% to ~6.0%. The whisker reinforced coating is promising to be used for high temperature wave-transmitting materials in long-time service.","Fan, Xingyu;Sun, Runjun;Dong, Jie;Wei, Liang;Wang, Qiushi",2020-09-30,Ceramics International,"Porous Si3N4 ceramic,Si3N4 whiskers toughened γ-Y2Si2O7 coating,Thermal shock resistance,Toughening mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.275,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.275
Comparing ablation properties of NbC and NbC-25 mol.% ZrC coating on SiC-coated C/C composites,"In this work, ablation properties of NbC and NbC-25 mol.% ZrC coating, deposited on SiC-coated C/C composites by supersonic atmospheric plasma spraying, were tested by an oxyacetylene torch. Results showed that, for NbC coating, an unexpected smooth liquid film mostly composed of niobium suboxides (such as NbO2 and NbO), rather than pure Nb2O5, generated during ablation for 45 s. Mechanical erosion resulted from the molten SiO2, and the relatively low viscosity of the outer oxide layer owing to insufficiently high melting point of niobium suboxides were the key factors for the failure mechanism of NbC coating. While NbC–ZrC coating abated for 90 s has a 97.49 and 66.53% decrease of linear and mass ablation rate relative to NbC coating ablated for 45 s, since ZrO2 hindering the evaporation of SiO2 droplets, and more thermal-stable Nb–O–Zr liquid film endow (NbC–ZrC)/SiC/C/C composites with an outstanding anti-ablation property.","He, Ruixiang;Li, Kezhi;Gu, Shengyue;Liu, Qian",2020-04-15,Ceramics International,"Carbon/carbon composites,Supersonic atmospheric plasma spraying,NbC coating,NbC-25 mol.% ZrC coating,Ablation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.197,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.197
Investigation of functionally graded HA-TiO2 coating on Ti–6Al–4V substrate fabricated by sol-gel method,"In this study, functionally graded hydroxyapatite-titanium dioxide coating (FGC HA-TiO2), with bottom-up composition: 100% TiO2, 50% TiO2 -50% HA, 100% HA, was produced by sol-gel method on the Ti–6Al–4V alloy substrate. The XRD, FTIR and XRF results signified heat treatment of each coating's layer at 450 °C leads to desired phase achievement. The coherence, strength and scratch resistance of FGC HA-TiO2 in comparison with control samples namely; single-layer HA and double-layer HA-TiO2 coatings, were assessed by cross-sectional SEM images and nano-scratch test. According to the results, the insertion of the TiO2 layer improves the bonding strength of the coating to the substrate and grading the coating composition plays an essential role in upgrading the integrity and coherency of the coating. The contribution of the TiO2 intermediate layer and composition gradient on developing coating strength was 22% and 36%, respectively. The immersion test in the simulated body fluid (SBF) suggested bioactivity of the Ti–6Al–4V substrate enhances by coating.","Azari, R.;Rezaie, H.R.;Khavandi, A.",2019-10-01,Ceramics International,"Functionally graded coating (FGC),Sol-gel,Hydroxyapatite (HA),TiO2,Scratch resistance,Coherency",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.317,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.317
Hybridized ZnO nanostructures on carbon-fiber through combustion synthesis induced by joule heating,"Zinc Oxide nanostructures have been hybridized on carbon fiber bundles though joule-heating carbon fiber coated with metallic zinc powder. Upon sufficient heat transfer from the carbon fiber in ambient atmospheric conditions, the metallic Zinc coating will undergo combustion. The combustion reaction will yield a variety of ZnO nanoparticles on the carbon fiber bundles. This simple cost-effective technique provides a fast, non-catalytic, and economic approach for the hybridization of ZnO nanowires on advanced textiles. The integration of ZnO nanostructures on the carbon fiber bundles can open up new avenues for multifunctional composites or smart materials.

The new method and minimum heating rates to cause ignition of Zn powders are discussed.","Quan, Jonathan;Colorado, Henry A.;Yeh, Po-Ching;Yang, Jenn-Ming",2016-08-15,Ceramics International,"ZnO,Carbon fiber,Hybrid nanostructures,Combustion synthesis,Multifunctional composites",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.085,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.085
Superhydrophilic Cu-doped TiO2 thin film for solar-driven photocatalysis,"Nanosized Cu-doped TiO2 film was prepared by the sol–gel spin coating technique. XPS analysis showed that Cu atoms had been successfully doped into TiO2 lattice, which hence modified the surface chemical composition. As a result, the Cu-doped TiO2 thin film possessed a superhydrophilic surface with a water contact angle (WCA) only 5.1° and exhibited excellent anti-fogging behavior. The Cu-doped TiO2 thin film also exhibited a much better photocatalytic activity than the reference TiO2 thin film, as evaluated by the degradation of 10mg/L methylene blue (MB) solution under simulated solar-driven irradiation.","Wang, S.;Meng, K.K.;Zhao, L.;Jiang, Q.;Lian, J.S.",2014-05-31,Ceramics International,"Photocatalysis,Thin films,Sol–gel,Cu-doping,Superhydrophilic surface",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.09.028,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.09.028
Fabrication and characterization of La0.65Sr0.3MnO3−δ/(Y2O3)0.08(ZrO2)0.92/Gd0.1Ce0.9O2−δ tri-composite cathode-supported tubular direct carbon solid oxide fuel cell,"The purpose of this study was to fabricate a porous supporting cathode for direct carbon solid oxide fuel cells (DCFC). Therefore, the effect of Gd0.1Ce0.9O2−δ (GDC) addition on the phase stability, sintering behavior, thermal expansion, and porosity of La0.65Sr0.3MnO3 −δ/(Y2O3)0.08(ZrO2)0.92 (LSM/YSZ) composite was evaluated. The sintering temperature and the porosity of the LSM/YSZ composite were observed to increase with increase in the amount of GDC. An LSM/YSZ/GDC tri-composite with optimized properties was selected to fabricate the tubular cathode-supported DCFCs (LSM/YSZ/GDC|YSZ|NiO/YSZ) through extrusion, slurry coating, and co-firing. A special chamber was designed for the DCFC operation of the tubular cell.

"Microstructure and wear resistance of in-situ synthesized Ti(C, N) ceramic reinforced Fe-based coating by laser cladding","In order to enhance the wear resistance of Fe-based cladding layer, TiN, Ti and graphite were added into Fe313 powder and in-situ formation of Ti(C, N) ceramic reinforcement phase was carried out by laser cladding. Firstly, thermodynamic calculations were used to determine the feasibility and favorability of a chemical reaction. Then, the reaction mechanism was investigated by adding five groups of different contents and carrying out EDS and phase analysis. We report that large TiN particles do not completely decompose and in-situ synthesized TiC phase forms around large TiN particles. However, small TiN particles are completely decomposed and directly formed the Ti(C, N) phase. Finally, through the friction and wear tests, it has been observed that the friction coefficient of a sample, with three powders added, was 0.559 times smaller than the substrate and 0.725 times smaller than the initial powder, and the wear volume of the same sample was 0.365 times smaller than the substrate and 0.799 times smaller than the initial powder. Therefore, it can be concluded that the in-situ synthesis of Ti(C, N) ceramic reinforced Fe-based coatings by laser cladding greatly improves the wear resistance of the Fe313 layer.","Yang, Lin;Yu, Tianbiao;Li, Ming;Zhao, Yu;Sun, Jiayu",2018-12-15,Ceramics International,"Laser cladding,In-situ formation,Ti(C,N),Wear resistance,TiN,TiC",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.025
Effect of zinc substitution on magneto-optical properties of Mn1−x Zn x Fe2O4/SiO2 nanocomposites,"Zn doped manganese ferrites (MZF)/SiO2 (Mn1−x Zn x Fe2O4/SiO2 (x=0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0)) nanocomposites with different Mn contents were successfully synthesized by a modified sol–gel autocombustion route using citric acid as a chelating agent and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as a source of silica matrix. Silica coatings were done via a modified Stöber method. Optical properties of MnZn-ferrites were improved by coating them with silica. The nitrate–citrate–silica gel exhibited self-propagating combustion behavior, and it is directly transformed into nanosized MnZn-ferrite nanoparticles with spinel cubic crystal structure. MZF/SiO2 nanocomposites show superparamagnetic behavior at room temperature (RT). The highest M s value is about 73Oe for Mn0.6Zn0.4Fe2O4 sample. This value is slightly less than that of the bulk Mn-ferrite, which is about 80emu/g. The higher M s value was attributed to cation distribution change from normal spinel to mixed structure. The diffuse reflectance (DR) measurements were applied to determine the band gap (E g) of samples. The estimated E g value of SiO2 coated ZnFe2O4 samples (1.95eV) is in accordance with the literature values. Silica coating has a positive impact on the optical band gap (E g) of MZF/SiO2 nanocomposite. In addition, the raising optical E g values by increasing Mn content were observed for MZF/SiO2 nanocomposites.","Baykal, Abdülhadi;Güner, Sadik;Demir, Ayse;Esir, Sinem;Genç, Fazilet",2014-09-30,Ceramics International,"C.

Densification of SiO2–cBN composites by using Ni nanoparticle and SiO2 nanolayer coated cBN powder,"Cubic boron nitride (cBN) powder was coated with Ni nanoparticle and SiO2 nanolayer (abbreviated as cBN/Ni and cBN/SiO2, respectively) by rotary chemical vapor deposition (RCVD), and compacted with SiO2 powder by spark plasma sintering at 1473–1973K for 0.6ks. The effects of Ni and SiO2 coatings on the densification, phase transformation of cBN and hardness of SiO2–cBN composites were compared. The phase transformation of cBN to hBN was identified at 1973K in SiO2–cBN/SiO2 composites, 300K higher than that in SiO2–cBN/Ni composites, indicating that SiO2 retarded the transformation of cBN. The relative density of SiO2–cBN/SiO2 with 50vol% cBN sintered at 1873K was 99% with a hardness of 14.5GPa.","Zhang, Jianfeng;Tu, Rong;Goto, Takashi",2012-08-31,Ceramics International,"Ni nanoparticle,SiO2 nanolayer,Cubic boron nitride (cBN),Rotary CVD (RCVD),Spark plasma sintering",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.02.090,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.02.090
Thermal shock behaviors of Ti1−x Zr x N coatings by accelerated test based on pulsed laser ablation,"The degradation behaviors of Ti1−x Zr x N coatings on SUS304 were investigated through an accelerated test method using a pulsed laser to induce thermal shock. The accelerated test was designed based on the Arrhenius model, and the changes in surface roughness were measured to determine the failure of the coating specimens. The predicted lifetimes obtained by a statistical analysis of the failure time data were increased by a factor of ~1.5 according to the increase in the Zr ratio from 10 to 50wt%. The increase of the lattice parameters and hardness for the as-deposited specimens indicated lattice volume expansion and distortion according to the Zr addition, respectively. Depth profiles for the coating (Ti, Zr) and the substrate (Fe, Cr) atoms revealed that the atomic diffusion distance by laser ablation decreased with lattice distortion. Delamination of the coating layer was only observed in the specimen with 10wt% of Zr after repeated thermal shock. The coating thickness decreased with surface cracks and was suppressed in the specimens with 30 and 50wt% of Zr by the increase of ZrN formation.","Jeon, Seol;Kim, Buyoung;Choi, Youngkue;Jo, Ilguk;Lee, Heesoo",2016-02-01,Ceramics International,"C.

Structural characterization of YSZ/Al2O3 nanostructured composite coating fabricated by electrophoretic deposition and reaction bonding,"Suspension of YSZ and Al particles in acetone in presence of 1.2g/l iodine as dispersant was used for electrophoretic deposition of green form YSZ/Al coating. Results revealed that applied voltage of 6V and deposition time of 3min were appropriate for deposition of green composite form coating. After deposition, a nanostructured dense YSZ/Al2O3 composite coating was fabricated by oxidation of Al particles at 600°C for 2h and subsequently sintering heat treatment at 1000°C for 2h. Melting and oxidation of Al particles in the green form composite coating not only caused reaction bonding between the particles but also lowered the sintering temperature of the ceramic coating about 200°C. The EDS maps confirmed that the composition of fabricated coating was uniform and Al2O3 particles were dispersed homogenously in YSZ matrix.","Ahmadi, Mojtaba;Aghajani, Hossein",2018-04-15,Ceramics International,"YSZ/Al2O3,Composite coating,Electrophoretic deposition,Oxidation,Reaction bonding",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.185,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.185
Sealing performance and chemical compatibility of SrO–La2O3–Al2O3–SiO2 glasses with bare and coated ferritic alloy,"Sealing performance and chemical compatibility of SrO–La2O3–Al2O3–SiO2 glass sealants with bare and Mn–Co spinel coated SUS430 ferritic alloys are investigated. The low–SrO glasses (≤40mol%) show good wettability and adherence to the bare SUS430 alloy due to their lower viscosity and negligible reactions with the alloy. The high–SrO glass (e.g. 45mol%) exhibits higher viscosity and more serious reactions with the bare SUS430 alloy. The formation of SrCrO4 with higher CTE causes obvious delamination and dramatic oxidation of the alloy at the glass/alloy interface. In contrast, Mn–Co spinel coating has good compatibility with both SrO–La2O3–Al2O3–SiO2 glasses and Fe–Cr ferritic alloy. Moreover, the Mn–Co spinel coating on the alloy can effectively restrain the diffusion of Fe and Cr and the reactions between the glasses and the alloy. Due to the ameliorated interfacial microstructure, sealing performance can be improved by applying the Mn–Co spinel coating on SUS430 alloy, especially for the bonded couple with high–SrO glass.","Wang, Xiuling;Ou, Ding Rong;Shang, Lei;Zhao, Zhe;Cheng, Mojie",2016-09-30,Ceramics International,"Solid oxide fuel cell,Chemical compatibility,Sealing performance,Glass sealant,Ferritic alloy,Mn–Co spinel",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.040,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.040
Facile synthesis and electrochemical properties of carbon-coated ZnO nanotubes for high-rate lithium storage,"ZnO is an important functional material, and a nanotube structure is beneficial for various applications. Here, we report the facile synthesis and electrochemical properties of carbon-coated ZnO nanotube materials as Li rechargeable battery anodes. ZnO nanorod was first synthesized via a simple hydrothermal method. Subsequently, the material was annealed with a carbon precursor, forming free-standing, carbon-coated ZnO nanotubes. The carbon-coated nanotube structure is beneficial to alleviate volume changes of the ZnO active material during Li insertion and extraction processes as well as to improve the electrochemical reaction kinetics. Electrochemical test results demonstrate that the carbon-coated ZnO nanotube electrodes deliver improved the cycling performance compared with ZnO nanorod electrodes. Better rate performance than carbon-coated ZnO nanoparticle electrodes was also achieved.","Kim, Han-Seul;Seo, Hyungeun;Kim, Kyungbae;Lee, Jaegab;Kim, Jae-Hun",2018-10-15,Ceramics International,"Zinc oxide,Nanotube,Carbon coating,Anode,Lithium-ion battery",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.031,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.031
Structure and high temperature wear characteristics of CVD coating on HEA-bonded cermet,"Ti(C,N)-based cermets with a CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy alloy (HEA) binder phase were coated via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The influence of the HEA-bonded cermet substrate on the microstructure, orientation, adhesion, and high temperature frictional wear performance of the CVD coating was investigated. The results indicate that the HEA binder phase inhibits the growth of cermet grains and provides more nucleation sites for the coating. Thus, the coating on the HEA-bonded cermet has a smaller grain size. The substitution of HEA for the Ni binder phase increases the entropy value of the cermet system, resulting in a decrease in free energy. In the early stage of CVD, the gas atoms adsorbed on the solid surface with low free energy are in a more stable thermodynamic state, which enhances the adhesion strength between the coating and substrate. During high temperature frictional wear, the friction coefficient of the coating on Ni-bonded cermet is less than that of the coating on HEA-bonded cermet because of iron oxide lubricating films. However, the wear rate exhibits a reverse trend. The coating on the HEA-bonded cermet has the best wear resistance due to small grain size, superior hardness and excellent adhesion strength. The wear forms present in the CVD coatings are abrasive wear, adhesive wear and oxidation wear.","Chai, Binbin;Xiong, Ji;Guo, Zhixing;Liu, Junbo;Ni, Lei;Xiao, Ya;Chen, Cheng",2019-10-15,Ceramics International,"HEA-Bonded cermets,CVD coatings,Adhesion,Wear resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.152,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.152
Suspension characterization and electrophoretic deposition of Yttria-stabilized Zirconia nanoparticles on an iron-nickel based superalloy,"Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) is the most common material for thermal barrier coatings. Suspensions of 3mol% YSZ nanoparticles in acetone medium have been prepared in presence of different amounts of iodine as dispersant. Size distribution of particles in the suspensions and zeta potential were measured as a function of dispersant concentration. Adding 1.2g/l iodine was found to be effective for the dispersion of YSZ nanoparticles in acetone. The stability of YSZ suspension in acetone increased with iodine content increasing until reached 1.2g/l. Mean diameter of particles and zeta potential of the YSZ suspension in acetone were 912nm and 2.4mV respectively, and with addition of 1.2g/l iodine shifted to 111.6nm and 50.2mV respectively.

Structure and electrochemical performance of surface modified LaPO4 coated LiMn2O4 cathode materials for rechargeable lithium batteries,"LiMn2O4 spinel cathode materials were coated with 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0wt% of LaPO4 by the polymeric process, followed by calcinations at 800°C for 6h in air. The structure and electrochemical properties of the surface modified LiMn2O4 materials were characterized by XRD, SEM, XPS, cyclic voltammetry and charge–discharge techniques. XRD patterns of LaPO4 coated LiMn2O4 revealed that the coating did not affect the crystal structure and space group Fd3m of the powder materials, compared to the uncoated LiMn2O4. XPS data illustrate that the LaPO4 was completely coated over the surface of the LiMn2O4 core materials. 2wt% of LaPO4 coated LiMn2O4 cathode material exhibits specific capacity of 103mAh/g (versus lithium metal) and excellent capacity retention (82% of its initial capacity) between 4.5 and 3V after 100 cycles at elevated temperature (50°C). LiMn2O4 coated with 0.0–3.0wt% of LaPO4 has slightly decreased the initial capacity, but the cycling stability increased remarkably over 3–4.5V. This result indicates that the surface treatment should be an effective way to improve the overall properties of the cathode materials for lithium ion batteries. Among them, 2wt% of LaPO4 coated spinel LiMn2O4 cathode material has improved the structural stability, high reversible capacity at elevated temperature and excellent electrochemical performances of the rechargeable lithium batteries.","Mohan, P.;Paruthimal Kalaignan, G.",2014-01-31,Ceramics International,"Positive electrode materials,LaPO4 coated LiMn2O4,XRD,XPS,Charge/discharge",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.07.024,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.07.024
Thermal conductivity in mullite/ZrO2 composite coatings,"Mullite-based multilayered structures have been suggested as promising environmental barrier coatings for Si3N4 and SiC ceramics. Mullite has been used as bottom layer because its thermal expansion coefficient closely matches those of the Si-based substrates, whereas Y–ZrO2 has been tried as top layer due to its stability in combustion environments. In addition, mullite/ZrO2 compositions may work as middle layers to reduce the thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the ZrO2 and mullite layers. Present work studies the thermal behaviour of a flame sprayed mullite/ZrO2 (75/25, v/v) composite coating. The changes in crystallinity, microstructure and thermal conductivity of free-standing coatings heat treated at two different temperatures (1000 and 1300°C) are comparatively discussed. The as-sprayed and 1000°C treated coatings showed an almost constant thermal conductivity (K) of 1.5Wm−1 K−1. The K of the 1300°C treated specimen increased up to twice due to the extensive mullite crystallization without any cracking.","García, E.;Mesquita-Guimarães, J.;Osendi, M.I.;Miranzo, P.",2010-07-31,Ceramics International,"C.

After that, the plasma sprayed CYSZ thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) were treated using a Nd:YAG pulsed laser. The effect of laser glazing on the microstructure of the coatings was investigated. The microstructures and surface topographies of both as-sprayed and laser glazed samples were investigated using field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM). The phases of the coatings were analyzed with X-ray diffractometry (XRD). The microstructural analysis results revealed that laser surface glazing of ceramic top coat reduced the surface roughness considerably, eliminated the surface porosities and produced a network of continuous cracks perpendicular to the surface.

Hot corrosion behaviour of nanostructured zirconia in molten NaVO3 salt,"Plasma sprayed coatings were fabricated from nanostructured yttria-stabilized zirconia powders (n-YSZ) with different crystalline grain sizes, prepared via sintering of nano ZrO2-4mol% Y2O3 powders at different temperatures. The hot corrosion behaviour of both n-YSZ powders and their corresponding coatings with sodium metavanadate (NaVO3) were investigated at 700°C. During hot corrosion, NaVO3 reacts with Y2O3 in YSZ to form YVO4, leading to a tetragonal to monoclinic destructive phase transformation of YSZ. The crystalline grain size of n-YSZ powders did not affect the hot corrosion mechanisms of both the n-YSZ powders and their corresponding coatings. However, compared with n-YSZ powders, the coatings were more easily corroded, and the coatings formed from starting powders with crystalline grain sizes <30nm featured better degradation resistance to hot corrosion.","Wang, Jinshuang;Sun, Junbin;Zou, Binglin;Zhou, Xin;Dong, Shujuan;Li, Lifen;Jiang, Jianing;Deng, Longhui;Cao, Xueqiang",2017-09-30,Ceramics International,"n-YSZ,Grain size,Hot corrosion,Phase transformation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.077,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.077
"The wear performance of carbide tools coated with TiAlSiN, AlCrN and TiAlN ceramic films in intelligent machining process","Nitride-based coatings are applied by cathodic arc physical vapor deposition (CAPVD) to improve the tribological properties of cutting tools. The present study examines the tool life of carbide tools coated with TiAlSiN, AlCrN and TiAlN films in intelligent machining process. Coating process was applied on both prismatic carbide test specimens and solid carbide end mills. Coating characterization was carried out on the test specimens. The structural, mechanical and tribological properties of different nitride-based coatings were investigated by means of field emission scanning electron microscope (FEG-SEM), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), scratch tester, reciprocating tribometer, calotester, microhardness device and optical profilometer. Impax steel was machined in CNC vertical machining center with uncoated and coated carbide end mills in order to determine the actual operating performance of the coatings. The g codes and toolpaths were created in the SolidCAM iMachining software. The cutting speed, feeds and overlap values are selected automatically and variably depending on geometry, tool and workpiece materials. The flank wear widths of tools were determined by SEM. In addition, the surface roughness values of the impax steel were measured from the finish surfaces. According to the scratch test results, the best adhesion results were obtained for TiAlN coating and the Lc1 critical load value was determined as about 30 N. The reciprocating sliding test results showed that the highest wear rate was obtained for the TiAlSiN coated specimen and the lowest wear rate was obtained for the uncoated specimen. Flank wear was observed on the tools after the milling process and the highest wear resistance was obtained TiAlN coated end mill.

Evaluation of hot corrosion behavior of plasma sprayed ceria and yttria stabilized zirconia thermal barrier coatings in the presence of Na2SO4+V2O5 molten salt,"In this study, substrates of Inconel 738 LC superalloy coupons were first sprayed with a NiCoCrAlY bondcoat and then with a ceria and yttria stabilized zirconia (CYSZ; ZrO2−25wt%CeO2−2.5wt%Y2O3) topcoat by air plasma spraying (APS). Hot corrosion studies of plasma sprayed thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) were conducted in 45wt%Na2SO4+55wt%V2O5 molten salt at 1000°C for 30h. The results showed that the coating defects, such as pores and microcracks play important roles as effective paths for the salt penetration in hot corrosion. Based on the results, the reaction between molten salt and stabilizers of zirconia (Y2O3 and CeO2), the formation of YVO4, CeVO4 and CeO2 crystals, the detrimental phase transformation of zirconia from tetragonal to monoclinic due to the depletion of stabilizers and finally, the creation of stresses were recognized to be in the degradation mechanism of CYSZ ceramic coatings in the presence of molten sulfate–vanadate salt.","Ahmadi-Pidani, Raheleh;Shoja-Razavi, Reza;Mozafarinia, Reza;Jamali, Hossein",2012-12-31,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,CYSZ,Air plasma spraying,Hot corrosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.05.047,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.05.047
Preparation and performance of thermal barrier coatings made of BNw-containing modified Nd2O3-doped yttria-stabilized zirconia,"To enhance the fracture toughness and thermal shock resistance of the thermal barrier coatings (TBCs), detonation spraying has been used to prepare modified neodymium (Ⅲ) oxide (Nd2O3)-doped yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) TBCs containing 20 vol% (D1 coating) and 30 vol% (D2 coating) of boron nitride whiskers (BNws). Analyses were performed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and a microhardness tester to examine the manner in which the doping content of different rare earth oxides affected the coating morphology, composition, and mechanical properties. The results denoted that the porosity of the D2 coating was 47.9% higher than that of the D1 coating; the whisker content was 30 vol% in the former and 20 vol% in the latter. The increased porosity reduced the microhardness and bond strength of the coating. However, the fracture toughness (KIC) of the D2 coating was increased to 2.67 MPa·m1/2 because the whisker content was 8.5% higher than that in the D1 coating. The thermal cycling life of the D2 coating was 245 cycles, and its thermal shock resistance was 9.9% higher when compared with that of the D1 coating. A TBC with better overall performance was obtained when BNw reached 30 vol%.","Haoliang, Tian;Guo, Jin;Erbao, Liu;Fuyuan, Wang;Changliang, Wang;Mengqiu, Guo;Junguo, Gao;Yongjing, Cui",2020-01-31,Ceramics International,"BN whisker,Nd2O3 rare earth oxide,YSZ thermal barrier coating,Mechanical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.289,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.289
Modelling of catastrophic stress development due to mixed oxide growth in thermal barrier coatings,"In thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) of heavy-duty gas turbines, thermally grown oxide (TGO) develops in two stages, i.e. firstly, a thin layer of dense protective α-Al2O3 forms slowly, and then, a layer of porous detrimental mixed oxide (MO) between top coat (TC) and α-Al2O3 appears. During long-term isothermal oxidation at high temperature, the failure of TBCs usually occurs when a critical thickness of MO is reached, but the exact failure mechanism is still largely unclear, let alone the related stress development. In this paper, we analyze the stress evolution and the resultant failure modes due to the whole-layer growth of uniform MO. The results show that it is MO, rather than α-Al2O3, that is mainly responsible for the micro-cracking and/or delamination in TBCs. The fast growth of expansive MO induces catastrophic stresses, which leads to micro-cracking in the α-Al2O3 layer. The cracking of α-Al2O3 layer reduces the oxidation resistance and further accelerates the MO growth. Our theoretical analysis provides a reasonable explanation of the experimental results.","Xie, Feng;Sun, Yongle;Li, Dingjun;Bai, Yu;Zhang, Weixu",2019-06-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs),Mixed oxide (MO),Oxidation,Stress evolution,Modelling",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.214,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.214
A numerical study of the influence of interface morphology on the stress behavior in thermal barrier coatings near an inclined film-cooling hole,"Early failure induced by the cooling-hole structure and the interface morphology has significant influence on the integrity of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). Thus, understanding the influence of interface morphology in TBCs on the stress behavior near an inclined film-cooling hole is highly desirable for evaluating the reliability of TBCs. In this study, a two-dimensional (2D) submodel of TBCs around a cooling hole was established to numerically investigate the influence of interface morphology in TBCs on the stress behavior near an inclined film-cooling hole. The results showed that the rough interface aggravated the stress state at both the top coat/thermally grown oxide (TC/TGO) and bond coat/thermally grown oxide (BC/TGO) interfaces. The maximum tensile stress appeared at the cooling-hole edge in the TC, whereas the maximum tensile stress occurred at the peaks of the BC. The different starting locations of the interface morphology from the cooling-hole edge had a significant effect on the stress behavior near the cooling-hole edge in TC, but they had no influence on the stress behavior in the BC. With increasing amplitude, the maximum tensile stress in the TC initially increased and then decreased. The interface asperity may have accelerated crack initiation at the peaks of the BC, but it had no influence on the stress level of the zone near the cooling-hole edge.","Cai, Zhenwei;Hong, Hui;Peng, Di;Zhao, Xiaofeng;Wang, Weizhe;Liu, Yingzheng;Cao, Zhaomin",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"Inclined film-cooling hole,TC/TGO and BC/TGO interface,Rough interface morphology,Interface asperity,Tensile stress behavior",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.135,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.135
Thermal stability of electrochemical–hydrothermal hydroxyapatite coatings,"Dense, uniform hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings were synthesized by hydrothermal crystal growth onto titanium substrates that were electrochemically seeded with HA nanocrystals. The HA was also doped with yttrium and/or fluoride during the hydrothermal reaction. The resulting HA coatings have a unique morphology consisting of crystal domains aligned with the crystallographic c-axis oriented normal to the surface of the coating. At elevated temperatures, the HA coatings were found to slowly decomposes via dehydroxylation to β -tricalcium phosphate ( β -TCP). Thermal decomposition negatively impacts the mechanical stability of the coating and can negatively impact performance in vivo due to the higher solubility of β -TCP relative to HA. It is shown that thermal decomposition of HA membranes can be avoided by adding water vapor to suppress dehydroxylation during thermal processing, or by doping the membrane with fluoride during hydrothermal synthesis. Thermal decomposition of HA coatings to β -TCP was characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Coatings of HA or yttrium-doped HA were found to be unstable in dry air above 600°C, but stable in a steam atmosphere at 900°C. Coatings doped with fluoride or co-doped with yttrium and fluoride were also thermally stable in dry air at 900°C. Therefore, the unique HA coating morphology and composition can be maintained during post-synthesis thermal processing or high temperature applications.","Savino, Keith;Yates, Matthew Z.",2015-08-31,Ceramics International,"Hydroxyapatite,Hydrothermal,Thermal stability,Fluoride",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.03.065,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.03.065
Drying stability enhancement of red-perovskite colloidal ink via ligand-derived coating for inkjet printing,"Today, inkjet printing techniques has many merits such as high printing yield and mask-free process for the various field. As one of the candidate ink materials, the perovskite is appropriate for inkjet printing due to the colloidal state and excellent optoelectronic properties such as high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM). Those characteristics are an advantage to fabricating ink and realize wide color-gamut in the small area with micro-patterning. However, perovskite application in inkjet printing with various color has limitations due to the low drying stability of mixed halide perovskite. Herein, we report on improving the drying stability of red perovskite by inducing aggregation during the drying process. Silane ligand has applied to induce the aggregation, and we confirmed that the thin coating layer has formed on the perovskite surface. The synthesized red-perovskite using silane ligands is well dispersed in the solvent as a colloidal state. And it maintained the emission intensity over 50% after drying. As-prepared perovskite ink has successfully printed on the ethyl cellulose film with 338 dpi with maintaining transparency of the film. These results are beneficial not only display applications but also security applications such as double anti-counterfeiting.","Yoo, Jung Hyeon;Jeong, Seong Guk;Choi, Seung Hee;Kwon, Seok Bin;Song, Young Hyun;Yoon, Dae Ho",2020-10-27,Ceramics International, ,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.179,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.179
Stress analysis of the thermal barrier coating system near a cooling hole considering the free-edge effect,"Due to the thermal mismatch between layers and the free-edge effect, interfacial peeling and shear stresses are generated locally around the edges of cooling holes in a thermal barrier coating (TBC)–film cooling system. These interfacial peeling and shear stresses may lead to modes I and II edge delamination, resulting in TBC spallation around the cooling hole. In this study, analytical and numerical models were built to study the stress and interfacial cracking behaviors of TBCs near the cooling hole. Analytical solutions for interfacial peeling moment and shear force at each layer were obtained to analyze the free-edge effect on the stress distributions in TBCs, and they were verified by the finite element calculations. The results showed that interfacial peeling moment and shear force were functions of the hole radius and thicknesses of top coat and oxide layer. The increase of interfacial peeling moment and shear force raised the likelihood of edge cracking around the hole. Derived by the local stresses, the interfacial cracks in TBCs initiated and propagated from the hole edge upon cooling.","Jiang, Jishen;Ma, Xianfeng;Wang, Biao",2020-01-31,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,Film cooling,Edge-effect,Peeling moment,Shear force",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.267,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.267
Microstructure and thermal shock resistance of Nd2O3-doped YSZ-based thermal barrier coatings,"To study the impact of rare earth oxide doping on the thermal failure of thermal barrier coatings, 0.5 mol%, 1.0 mol% and 1.5 mol% Nd2O3-doped YSZ coatings were prepared by explosive spraying. SEM, XRD, EDS and microhardness testing were used to analyse the effect of different rare earth oxide doping contents on the morphology, composition and mechanical properties of the coatings. With an increase in the Nd2O3 doping content, the porosity of the coatings was reduced. The decrease in the porosity increased the compactness of the coatings and improved the microhardness and fracture toughness. The bonding strength and thermal shock resistance of the coatings were the highest among the samples herein when the rare earth doping content was 1.0 mol%, and the values were 37.6 MPa and 200 times, respectively. The thermal shock failure mode of the coating was mainly due to the exfoliation of the inner layer of the ceramic layer. The luminous intensity of the coating increased with increasing rare earth oxide doping content, and the emission spectrum of the Nd2O3-modified YSZ coating after the thermal shock test produced a new emission peak at 594 nm, which decreased at 708 nm.","Xing, Qin;Shu-ai, Zhang;Xiaofeng, Gong;Renping, Yu;Yi, Liang;Hui, Tong;Shicheng, Wei;Yongchao, Fang;Hao, Wang;Shengjian, Xiong",2020-12-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,Nd2O3 oxide,Fluorescence intensity,Mechanical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.160,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.160
Silver nanowires on acid-alkali-treated titanium surface: Bacterial attachment and osteogenic activity,"In the present work, a nanoscale porous surface was gradually prepared on Ti surface by two-step method of acid corrosion and NaOH–H2O2 mixing treatment. This led to the formation of a TiO2 coating at the surface of the underlying Ti substrate. Then, silver nanowires were deposited on the nanostructured surface by spin-coating technology. The nanowires were found to be evenly introduced into the nanostructured TiO2 coating. The modified Ti surface showed good wettability and protein adsorption capacity. More importantly, in-vitro cellular and bacterial assays indicated that the modified Ti surface possessed not only the excellent adhesion and differentiation abilities for osteoblasts but also relatively strong antimicrobial capacities for both S. aureus and E. coli. The results suggest that such modified Ti surfaces greatly prefer the initial adhesion of osteoblast-like cells over the initial adhesion of bacteria. The surface modification that we made to Ti substrate can promisingly meet clinical requirements.","Zhang, Chao;Lan, Jinping;Wang, Shuo;Han, Shuguang;Yang, Hao;Niu, Qimeng;Wang, Jing;Wang, Qianqian;Xiang, Yuhong;Wu, Yuwei;Zhang, Xuejiao;Lin, He;Zhang, Xiaoyun;Qiao, Haixia;Huang, Yong",2019-12-15,Ceramics International,"Silver nanowire,Nanostructured coatings,Antibacterial,Cytocompatibility",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.180,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.180
Characterisation of a saddle field source for deposition of diamond-like carbon films,"A saddle field cold cathode source was used to produce diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings by dissociation and ionisation of acetylene in a low pressure vacuum. Langmuir probe investigations of the ion current density and plasma potentials showed the existence of a positive potential barrier at a distance 100 mm from the source with an ionisation rate up to 80% in the carbon flux in the near source region and less than 15% ionisation at larger distances.

Structure and properties of nanostructured Fe(AlCr)2O4–Cr–(AlCr)2O3–Fe composite coating prepared by plasma spraying,"In-situ nanostructured Fe(AlCr)2O4-based composite coating (FACr52.5 coating) was prepared by reactive plasma spraying with micro-sized Al–Fe2O3–Cr2O3 powders. The microstructure, toughness and Vickers hardness, and adhesive strength of the coating were investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and mechanical tests. The results indicated that the interlamellar spacing of the FACr52.5 coating is only 1μm. The coating exhibited nanostructured microstructure. The in-situ Cr (20nm) and Fe (50–200nm) particles were uniformly distributed in an Fe(AlCr)2O4 matrix, while the grain size of the Fe(AlCr)2O4 matrix is about 60nm. The FACr52.5 composite nano-coating exhibited much higher hardness, better wear resistance, stronger adhesive strength and toughness as compared to those of the composite nano-coating sprayed with Fe2O3–Al powders. Excellent mechanical properties of the FACr52.5 coating were attributed to the uniform distribution of the in-situ nano-sized Cr particles in the coating matrix.","Wang, Lei;Chen, Xueguang;Yan, Dianran;Yang, Yong;Chu, Zhenhua",2015-09-30,Ceramics International,"Composite coating,Reactive plasma spraying,Nanostructure coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.04.052,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.04.052
Investigations on the efficiency variation of zinc and gallium Co-doped TiO2 based dye sensitized solar cells,"In this research the electric performances of Dye Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) using titanium dioxide (TiO2) photoanodesco-doped with 1% Zn & (0%, 0.5%, 1% and 1.5%) Ga has been investigated. The films of undoped and co-doped TiO2 have been deposited by sol gel dip coating technique. The structure and optical properties of pure and 1% Zn & (0%, 0.5%, 1% and 1.5%) Ga co-doped TiO2 films are investigated. XRD spectra reveal that studied films hasanatase tetragonal structure of TiO2with a small shifting angle when the doping percentages of Zn and Gaare increased. The crystallites have an average size in the range of 11–18 nm. Calculated lattice parameters are well matched with the reported value. a-axis remains same with doping while c-axis varies with doping. UV–Vis spectroscopy results show that band gap energy (Eg) is decreased with doping. Maximum decrease in Eg is found at the doping percentage of 1% Zn and 1% Ga and value is 3.20 eV. The efficiency of realized DSSC is increased considerably compared to that using pure TiO2 photoanode. The current versus voltage (I–V) characteristics reveal that the DSSC prepared using 1% Zn & 1% Ga co-doped TiO2 layer has significantly improved parameters.

Aluminum nitride (AlN) reinforced electrodeposited Ni–B nanocomposite coatings,"Ni–B nanocomposite coatings containing various concentration aluminum nitride (AlN) nanoparticles (NPs) were developed through a scalable and conventional electrodeposition process. The influence of addition of AlN nanoparticles (0.6 and 1.2 g L−1) on the morphological, mechanical and corrosion protection efficiency of Ni–B nanocomposite coatings was explored using SEM, XPS, XRD, AFM and electrochemical techniques. The incorporation of AlN nanospecies into the Ni–B matrix coating decreased the porosity of the cauliflower-like structure and improved the mechanical properties including hardness and wear. The mechanism of electrochemical co-deposition was proposed. The potentiodynamic analysis exhibited that the protection efficiency (PE%) of Ni–B coating is ~20%, which increased to ~53% and ~73% by addition of AlN nanoparticles of 0.6 and 1.2 g L−1, respectively. The corrosion resistance could be credited to the presence of inactive and insulating AlN nanoparticles that filled the existing defects in Ni–B matrix and subsequently decreased the active area exposed to the corrosive electrolyte (3.5 wt.% NaCl).","Radwan, A.

Fabrication of MgO-CaZrO3 refractory composites from Egyptian dolomite as a clinker to rotary cement kiln lining,"Dolomite is used as basic lining for rotary cement kiln due its high refractoriness, corrosion resistance against basic environments and high coating performance, but its poor hydration resistance limits its use. In this work, Egyptian dolomite was converted into outstanding refractory magnesia-calcium zirconate composite (M-CZ) by the addition of 37.8–47.8 wt% zirconia. The mixtures were milled, uni-axially formed and fired at a temperature of 1400–1550 °C for 2 h. Thermal analysis, phase composition, microstructure, densification parameters, and other technological properties of the fired specimens were investigated. It was found that sintered M-CZ composite with bulk density (3.95 g/cm3), cold crushing strength (170 MPa), and high coating ability can be obtained by firing Egyptian dolomite with 37.8 wt% zirconia at temperature 1500 °C with the formation of belite as a secondary product.

On a solar reflective ceramic based glaze for asphalt shingle,"Solar reflective materials are one of the most effective solutions to counteract Urban Heat Island effect. Among them, asphalt shingles are one of the most widely used products. To improve solar reflectance of these surfaces usually both polymeric paint on the final product or ceramic glazes applied directly on the granules surface through rotary kiln are used. In this study the Design of Experiment approach is applied to an industrial formulation for ceramic glaze for asphalt shingles in order to find the optimal combination between pigment (Rutile and Talc), liquid phase (Sodium Silicate and Water) and heat treatment (700°C −1100°C). On the most significant samples, moreover, XRD and ESEM characterization has been performed in order to better understand the behaviour of the studied system. Interesting values in Solar reflectance were obtained, reaching ρsol=0.882 creating a good solar reflective product ready to be applied, through rotary kiln, on mineral granules for asphalt shingles.","Ferrari, C.;Mugoni, C.;Montorsi, M.;Siligardi, C.",2017-12-01,Ceramics International,"Ceramic glaze,Asphalt shingle,Solar reflectance,Reflective coating,Experimental design,Central composite face-centered design",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.200,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.200
"Correlation between microstructure, chemical components and tribological properties of plasma-sprayed Cr2O3-based coatings","The wear resistance of chromium oxide (Cr2O3) coatings could be improved by doping modification and changing the structural scale, etc. In this study, micrometric Cr2O3 coatings were doped with different additives, CeO2 and Nb2O5. Moreover, Cr2O3 coatings were deposited from nanostructured feedstock by the combination process of plasma spraying and dry-ice blasting. The correlation between the microstructure, chemical components and tribological properties of plasma-sprayed Cr2O3-based coatings was discussed based on the investigation of their porosity, hardness and friction behaviors. The results showed that the composite coatings doped with additives exhibited a higher microhardness, corresponding to a lower porosity than pure Cr2O3 coating under the identical plasma-spray condition. CeO2 constituent was found to improve the wear resistance of Cr2O3 coating while Nb2O5 incorporation corresponds to a steep rise in the friction coefficient. The mismatch of coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between Cr2O3 and Nb2O5 lamellae facilitated the origin of fatigue cracks and the formation of microfracture pits. Although the combination process promotes a porosity reduction, the nanostructured Cr2O3 (n-Cr2O3) coatings present a lower microhardness than micrometric coatings, due to their loosen microstructure from insufficient plasma power compared to microscaled coatings. The wear mechanisms of both the micro- and nanometric Cr2O3 coatings are fatigue cracks and material transfer.","Yang, Xiong;Zeng, Jinyan;Zhang, Hao;Wang, Jinshuang;Sun, Junbin;Dong, Shujuan;Jiang, Jianing;Deng, Longhui;Zhou, Xin;Cao, Xueqiang",2018-06-15,Ceramics International,"Cr2O3-based coatings,Atmospheric plasma spraying (APS),Chemical components,Porosity,Tribological behavior",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.004
Rational design of coaxial MWCNTs@Si/SiOx@C nanocomposites as extending-life anode materials for lithium-ion batteries,"One-dimensional (1D) uniform multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)@Si/SiOx@C nanocomposites were prepared by the magnesiothermic reduction of MWCNT@SiO2 nanocables and subsequent carbon coating process. Through simply altering the acid-treatment conditions, SiOx were reserved on the surface of MWCNTs to seal and fix the Si nanoparticles, along with the carbon coating layer, the reducted Si nanoparticles (Si NPs) were entirely encapsulated in the 1D coaxial nanocomposites. Due to the multiple volume expansion limit effects of inner Si nanoparticles, the cycling stability has been greatly improved. When worked as anodes for lithium-ion batteries, the MWCNTs@Si/SiOx@C electrode exhibits better electrochemical properties than bulk Si and MWCNTs, as well as an extending cycle life of 500 cycles in comparsion to our previous MWCNTs@Si nanocomposites. It is believed that the MWCNTs can provide structural support and enhance the electronic mobility, while the SiOx and carbon buffer component would anchor the Si NPs firmly and accommodate the volume expansion of Si.","Chen, Yifan;Mao, Qinan;Bao, Liang;Yang, Tao;Lu, Xiaoxiao;Du, Ning;Zhang, Yaguang;Ji, Zhenguo",2018-10-01,Ceramics International,"Lithium-ion batteries,Anodes,MWCNT@Si/SiOx@C nanocomposites,Magnesiothermic reduction",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.093,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.093
Hydrous ruthenium oxide-tantalum pentoxide thin film electrodes prepared by thermal decomposition for electrochemical capacitors,"In this work, we have fabricated high-performance thin-film electrodes for electrochemical capacitors (ECs) via thermal decomposition syntheses of RuO2–Ta2O5 coating layers on Ti substrates. The influences of decomposition temperature as well as the Ru/Ta molar ratio on material and electrochemical properties of the EC electrodes are systematically investigated. The thermal decomposition of 300 °C preserves a large fraction of hydrous RuO2·xH2O within the hybrid oxide and consequently improves the electrode capacitance. The amorphous Ta2O5 incorporation can manipulate the RuO2 crystallinity and thus its specific capacitance. An optimal Ru/Ta molar ratio of 7:3 is determined for the RuO2–Ta2O5 electrode, which can deliver an energy density of 4.8 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 8720 W kg−1 (or 8.3 Wh L−1 at 15,000 W L−1). In addition, an excellent durability of 97.6% capacitance retention after 3000 charge-discharge cycles is found for this electrode.

Preparation and properties of Eu and Dy co-doped strontium aluminate long afterglow nanomaterials,"The long afterglow nanomaterials of strontium aluminate co-doped by Eu and Dy have been synthesized by co-precipitation combined hydrothermal method. The effects of hydrothermal time, calcination time, pH value, the amount of aluminum nitrate, activator, co-activator and flux H3BO3 on the fluorescence properties of the product were investigated by means of single factor optimization experiment. Then the orthogonal experiment was employed to obtain the optimal synthesis conditions that are as follows: nDy/nEu = 2.5, tc = 2.5 h, nEu/nSr = 0.02, th = 8 h. Subsequently, the optimal synthesis conditions were verified by three repeated experiments, and the obtained products were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and fluorescence spectrometer. The results showed that the synthesized target products all were the mixed crystal phase of SrAl2O4 and Sr4All4O25. The particles presented regular spherical-like with size ~ 100 nm. The dopants Eu and Dy were confirmed existed in the SrAl2O4 powders. The fluorescence and afterglow data of the target products were better than that in the orthogonal experiment scheme. The primary emission spectra band was in the range of 400–600 nm with characteristic peak located at ~ 460 nm corresponding to the transitions of Eu2+ ions from 4f65d→4f7, and the blue light can be observed by naked eyes. The similar fast-decaying and slow-decaying processes were displayed in all the afterglow curves, and the initial afterglow brightness of the target product is apparently higher than that of products synthesized by the orthogonal experiment.

Preparation of silicon coated-carbon fiber reinforced HA bio-ceramics for application of load-bearing bone,"To facilitate the optimal application of carbon fiber (CF) reinforced hydroxyapatite (HA) bio-ceramics as load-bearing bone substitutes, we adopted the magnetron sputtering method to prepare a Si coating on CF surface and then prepared Si-coated CF (Si-CF) with controllable alignment reinforced HA composites via pressureless and hot-press sintering. CFs were evenly distributed in the HA matrix according to the designed layers and alignment states using a special mold and technology. The results showed that uniform and continuous Si coatings with a thickness of approximately 0.2 μm covered the surface of CF. The bending strength of three-layer Si-CF reinforced HA (3Si-CF/HA) bio-ceramics fabricated by pressureless sintering was 33 MPa, which is 45% higher than that of three-layer CF reinforced HA (3CF/HA) bio-ceramics. Three-layer Si-CF reinforced HA bio-composites fabricated by hot-press sintering (H/Si-CF/HA) had a bending strength of 80.9 MPa, which is more than five times that of 3CF/HA bio-ceramics. The corresponding fracture toughness of H/Si-CF/HA was 2.53 MPa m1/2, which is 27.14% higher than that of 3Si-CF/HA composites. Compared with CF reinforced by HA, Si-coated CF could reduce the contact between CF and the O2 produced by the decomposition of HA. The chemical reaction between Si and O2 produces SiO2. The barrier layer provided by the Si and SiO2 coatings can prevent oxidative damage of CF during sintering and maintain the original reinforcing and toughening effects of CF. Axial pressure strengthened the bond between CF and the HA matrix in the H/Si-CF/HA composites sintered at high temperature. The pores and activated grain boundaries of the composites were reduced, and their degree of densification was improved. Therefore, the bending strength and fracture toughness of H/Si-CF/HA composites were improved and are able to satisfy the requirements of load-bearing bones.","Zhao, Xueni;Zheng, Jiamei;Zhang, Weigang;Chen, Xueyan;Gui, Zhenzhen",2020-04-15,Ceramics International,"Carbon fiber,Si coating,Hydroxyapatite,Controllable alignment,Bio-ceramics",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.010
Thermal shock and ablation behavior of α-cordierite glass-ceramic coating on porous BN/Si2N2O ceramic,"Thermal shock and ablation behavior of α-cordierite glass-ceramic coating on porous BN/Si2N2O ceramic substrate were investigated. The coated sample was fractured after 18 thermal shock cycles without peeling off of the coating, while the porous BN/Si2N2O ceramic was fractured after 3 thermal shock cycles. The coated sample has a balter thermal shock resistance than the substrate sample, which can be attributed to the strong interface bonding, the cracks self-healing and thermal barrier of the coating. The ablation surface temperature, mass and linear ablation rates of the porous BN/Si2N2O ceramic were all reduced by the coating, indicating that the substrate had a good ablation resistance under the protection of the coating. In the ablation atmosphere of high-temperature-speed oxyacalylene flame, thermochemical reactions, melting loss, and coupling balween them are the ablation mechanism of the coating/substrate composite.","Yang, Zhihua;Sun, Yangshan;Cai, Delong;Wang, Bingzhu;Jia, Dechang",2019-12-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal shock,Ablation,α-cordierite,Glass-ceramic coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.221,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.221
Structure and properties of nano SiC coatings in-situ fabricated by laser irradiation,"The nano SiC coatings were prepared on the surface of graphite by laser irradiation under different laser energy densities (7.07–14.15 kJ/cm2). The influence of laser energy density on the structure and quality of coatings was systematically investigated. The results show that laser irradiation can transform the preset micron-SiC particle coating into nano-SiC particle coating. The nano-SiC coating prepared by laser irradiation can effectively enhance the high temperature oxidation resistance of the graphite substrate. When the laser energy density is 7.07 kJ/cm2, the prepared coating displays a single crystal structure and a good morphology without cracks and spheroidization. The coating prepared under the laser density of 10.61 kJ/cm2 shows a mixed crystal structure with obvious spheroidization. Further increase the laser energy density to 14.15 kJ/cm2, the main structure of prepared coating turns to polycrystalline and obvious cracks can be observed. The cross-section analysis of coating prepared under laser energy density of 7.07 kJ/cm2 indicates that there existed elemental diffusion between the coating and the substrate which increased the adhesion of coating. The calculations based on the Arrhenius formula present that this prepared coating has higher activation energy and therefore it has better high temperature oxidation resistance than the other prepared coatings.","Luo, Fang;Jiang, Rongjie;Hu, Xiaodong;He, Zhen;Wang, Yuxin",2020-07-31,Ceramics International,"Nanomaterials,SiC coating,Laser energy density,Crystal structure,High temperature oxidation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.279,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.279
"Morphological evolution, luminescence properties and a high-sensitivity ethanol gas sensor based on 3D flower-like MoS2–ZnO micro/nanosphere arrays","A three-dimensional (3D) flower-like MoS2–ZnO micro/nanosphere array was successfully prepared via a simple two-step synthesis process. The morphology of the samples was characterised using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the growth mechanism was elucidated. Raman spectroscopy revealed two intense peaks with enhanced intensity attributed to E 2 g 1 (383.3 cm−1) and A1g (407.1 cm−1) modes of MoS2. The PL spectrum showed an increase in the IUV/IDLE ratio, which indicated that the crystallinity of the sample improved after the MoS2 coating was applied. Gas sensors were fabricated from MoS2–ZnO micro/nanospheres to detect 500 ppm of ethanol at 220 °C. The response and recovery times of the MoS2–ZnO sensor for ethanol gas were 30 s and 10 s, respectively, and the response intensity was 12.08. Compared to pure ZnO, the response and recovery times were shortened by 5s and 6s, and the response intensity was increased by ~6 times. The corresponding gas sensing mechanism was investigated in detail. Our results demonstrate that 3D flower-like MoS2–ZnO micro-nanospheres are expected to be promising for ultra-high gas sensitivity applications.","Song, Zhichao;Zhang, Jun;Jiang, Jialiang",2020-04-01,Ceramics International,"3D flower-like,MoS2–ZnO micro/nanospheres,SEM,Raman spectroscopy,Photoluminescence,Gas sensors",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.151,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.151
Structural and optical studies on sol–gel derived ZnO thin films by excimer laser annealing,"High-quality polycrystalline ZnO thin films were deposited onto alkali-free glasses at a temperature of 300°C in air ambience by combining sol–gel spin coating and KrF excimer laser annealing. The effects of laser irradiation energy density on the crystallization, microstructure, surface morphology, and optical transmittance of as-prepared ZnO thin films were investigated and compared to the results of thermally annealed ZnO thin films. The crystallinity level and average crystallite size of laser annealed ZnO thin films increased as laser energy density increased. The crystallinity levels and average crystallite size of excimer laser annealed (ELA) thin films were greater than those of the thermally annealed (TA) thin films. However, laser annealed thin films had abnormal grain growth when irradiation energy density was 175mJ/cm2. Experimental results indicated that the optimum irradiation energy density for excimer laser annealing of ZnO sol–gel films was 150mJ/cm2. The ELA 150 thin films had a dense microstructure, an RMS roughness value of 5.30nm, and an optical band gap of 3.38eV, close to the band gap of a ZnO crystal (3.4eV).","Tsay, Chien-Yie;Wang, Min-Chi",2013-01-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Influence of Ag content on the antibacterial properties of SiC doped hydroxyapatite coatings,"The main goal of the paper is to enhance the resistance to the bacteria of the hydroxyapatite deposited on Ti6Al4V alloy substrate. Hydroxyapatite coatings, enriched with SiC and Ag, were prepared and investigated for this paper. SiC was added to enhance film corrosion resistance, while by Ag addition the improvement of the antibacterial properties was foreseen. The coatings, with different Ag contents, were deposited on Ti6Al4V alloy substrates by co-sputtering of hydroxyapatite, SiC and Ag targets, using a magnetron sputtering system. The films were characterized in terms of elemental and phase composition, texture, morphology, corrosion resistance and antibacterial activity (Staphylococcus aureus MRSA, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615, Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 14028), by EDS, XRD, FTIR, SEM and AFM techniques, electrochemical tests and antimicrobial tests. The influence of the Ag content on the film properties was also analysed. The antibacterial efficacies of hydroxyapatite versus Gram-positive bacteria are demonstrated if a small amount of Ag was added in their structure. The hydroxyapatite with Ag content less than 1at% proves to have a good resistance to the bacteria attack, even if the content is reduced.","Badea, M.;Braic, M.;Kiss, A.;Moga, M.;Pozna, E.;Pana, I.;Vladescu, A.",2016-01-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Effects of atom- and phase-scale compressive stress on fracture toughness in yttrium-doped lanthanum zirconate solid solutions,"The poor fracture toughness of cubic pyrochlores has severely blocked their wide application. To toughen them, a series of yttrium dopants have been introduced to lanthanum zirconate, creating atomic or phase-scale compressive stress dependent on the concentration of dopants. We find bigger substitutional dopants, rather than smaller ones, can toughen cubic ceramics, attributing to the dominance of an imposed atomic compressive stress to surroundings over the local one near normal point defects. For special point defects such as oxygen vacancies or interstitials, the local stress in their vicinity could become dominant given an adequate concentration. Despite of the pyrochlore/fluorite intermixture possessing evidently reduced grains, it only exhibits intermediate fracture toughness, suggesting negligible grain refining effects on toughening. Further, a random distribution of atomic compressive stress induced by disordered oxygen vacancies is beneficial to toughening. This research highlights the atomic compressive stress on toughening, providing guidance for future design of novel thermal barrier coatings.","Wang, Yanfei;Xiao, Ping;Yang, Huan;Wang, Siqing;Liu, Rongjun;Cao, Yingbin",2018-04-15,Ceramics International,"Cubic pyrochlores,Fracture toughness,Atomic compressive stress,Toughening,Thermal barrier coatings",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.062,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.062
"Nickel-substituted LiMnPO4/C olivine cathode material: Combustion synthesis, characterization and electrochemical performances","Transition metals substitution in cathode materials is considered as an effective approach to improve the electrochemical performances of lithium–ion batteries. In this regard, host and Ni-substituted LiMn1-xNixPO4 (x = 0.00–0.05) olivine cathode materials were successfully synthesized by a modified solution combustion method. The structural and morphological properties were examined by X–ray diffraction (XRD), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy. According to X-ray diffraction results, all substituted materials LiMn1-xNixPO4/C adopt an identical structure to that of the LiMnPO4 olivine structure, suggesting that the nickel ion has been well incorporated into the crystal lattice, without any changes in the host material structure. When x = 0.05, the material shows an excellent specific capacity and stability during charge/discharge process. The initial specific discharge capacity can reach up to 138.6 mAh g−1 at C/20 between 2.5 and 5 V, with a coulombic efficiency of about 91.1%. The results confirm that the cyclic stability and the electrochemical performances of LiMnPO4/C were highly improved by Ni-doping.","EL Khalfaouy, Redouan;Turan, Servet;Dermenci, Kamil Burak;Savaci, Umut;Addaou, Abdellah;Laajeb, Ali;Lahsini, Ahmed",2019-10-01,Ceramics International,"Olivine material,Ni-substitution,LiMnPO4 cathode,Combustion synthesis,Lithium-ion battery,Carbone coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.336,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.336
Enhanced mechanical and dielectric properties of SiCf/SiC composites with silicon oxycarbide interphase,SiCf/SiC composites with silicon oxycarbide (SiOC) interphase were successfully prepared using silicone resin as interphase precursor for dip-coating process and polycarbosilane as matrix precursor for PIP process assisted with hot mold pressing. The effects of SiOC interphase on mechanical and dielectric properties were investigated. XRD and Raman spectrum results show that SiOC interphase is composed of silicon oxycarbide and free carbon with a relatively low crystalline degree. The surface morphology of SiC fibers with SiOC interphase is smooth and homogeneous observed by SEM. The flexural strength and failure displacement of SiCf/SiC composites with SiOC interphase vary with the thickness of interphase and the maximum value of flexural strength is 289MPa with a failure displacement of 0.39mm when the thickness of SiOC interphase is 0.25µm.

Chemical vapor deposition of ZrN using in situ produced ZrCl4 as a precursor,"ZrN is considered a promising material for high performance coatings of various tools, due to its outstanding mechanical properties. To generate ZrN layers, ZrCl4, a precursor, is effortlessly produced by the reaction of metallic Zirconium with HCl under elevated temperature, utilizing H2 as a carrier gas. In a subsequent CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) reactor the ZrCl4 reacts with NH3, forming ZrN coatings. By varying the experimental conditions, such as the H2 and NH3 gas flow, as well as addition of N2 to the reaction gas, the influence on coating thickness, surface morphology and crystal structure of the generated coatings was investigated. Furthermore, the effects of various deposition temperatures in addition to positional differences of the hardmetal samples in the coating reactor were explored. Ultimately, the generated samples were analyzed by evaluation of coating thickness, light optical microscopy as well as SEM, EDX and XRD measurements.","Rauchenwald, Elisabeth;Lessiak, Mario;Weissenbacher, Ronald;Haubner, Roland",2019-05-31,Ceramics International,"Films,Composites,Nitrides,Wear resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.191,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.191
"On the chemical interaction of Li1+x(Ni,Mn)O2 with carbon and carbon precursors","The thermal stability of Li1+xNi0.5Mn0.5O2 cathode materials in contact with carbon and in the course of carbon coating by pyrolysis of various carbon precursors in argon is studied. XRD patterns of Li1+xNi0.5Mn0.5O2–carbon mixtures demonstrate the first traces of phase decomposition at 600°C while corresponding TG curves show at the significant interaction between components at T>400°C. Similar interaction of complex oxide with polyethylene glycol pyrolysis products causes the complete deterioration of the layered compound. The first stage of this deterioration is a systematic increase in cation disorder between A and B sublattices of the hexagonal ABO2 structure. However, the pyrolysis of polyvinyl alcohol at 350°C results in the formation of nanostructured carbon film. The analysis of as-obtained Li1+xNi0.5Mn0.5O2–carbon composites by Raman spectroscopy shows that the linear structure of polyvinyl alcohol promotes the domination of sp2 forms of carbon in the pyrolysis products while the thermolysis products of cross-linked polymer contain mostly sp3-carbon.","Kurilenko, K.A.;Shlyakhtin, O.A.;Brylev, O.A.;Drozhzhin, O.A.",2014-12-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Hydroxyapatite/tricalcium silicate composites cement derived from novel two-step sol-gel process with good biocompatibility and applications as bone cement and potential coating materials,"Tricalcium silicate (C3S) and hydroxyapatite (HAp) composites were fabricated through the sol-gel process. The aim of this research is to improve the biocompatibility of C3S through HAp addition and study the potential of using this as coating materials. The composites (HAp/C3S) were characterised by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, thermal gravity-differential thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction. The working and setting times of cement pastes were tested using Gillmore needle. Mechanical properties were examined by nanoindentation and material testing system. In vitro biocompatibility of the materials were studied by cell attachment and viability of L929 and MG-63 cells. HAp/C3S as a coating material on gelatin film were measured with the surface roughness and imaged by scanning electron microscope. With the addition of HAp, no undesirable free CaO was detected with the synthesis by the sol-gel preparation. The pH values of HAp added groups were between 7.54 and 8.76, which were much lower than pure C3S group (pH = 11.75). For in vitro studies, the presence of HAp could effectively enhance the cell attachment and viability of both L929 and MG-63 cells grown in the extract or directly on the composites. However, the mechanical properties of the composites were impaired as compared to pure C3S. Lastly, HAp/C3S cement could be evenly coated on gelatin film. HAp is successfully demonstrated to improve C3S biocompatibility with this new composites HAp/C3S. C-75 (75% C3S and 25% HAp), in particular, has good biocompatibility, relatively high compressive strength and can be uniformly coated onto gelatin film. Thus, C-75 is a promising material for further investigation as a coating on other biopolymers.","Liu, Wai-Ching;Wang, Huey-Yuan;Chen, Lung-Chien;Huang, Shih-Wei;Wu, Chengtie;Chung, Ren-Jei",2019-04-01,Ceramics International,"Tricalcium silicate,Hydroxyapatite,Sol-gel process,Coating,Biocompatibility",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.032,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.032
Magnetron sputter deposition of hafnium nitride coating on high density graphite and niobium substrates,"Hafnium nitride (HfN) is a refractory compound considered to be a suitable material for reaction barriers. The present paper deals with the preparation of HfN thin films by reactive magnetron sputtering on high density (HD) graphite and niobium substrates. Deposition process parameters have been optimised with Si(100) substrate in order to get HfN coating of 3μm thickness. The optimised parameters were used to deposit HfN on HD graphite and on niobium substrates. The results showed that HfN coating with a thickness of 2.8μm was successfully deposited on HD graphite and niobium substrates. The presence of HfN was confirmed by glancing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XRD studies on HfN coating on Si(100), HD graphite and Nb substrates showed nanocrystalline grains of size 130, 55 and 46Å, respectively. The surface morphology of HfN coating on HD graphite and niobium by atomic force microscope (AFM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed that nanoparticles are getting agglomerated into clusters. The HfN coating on niobium substrate exhibited good adhesion compared to that on HD graphite as studied by microscratch test. The thermal stress generated in the sputter deposited HfN coating on HD graphite and niobium substrates were calculated by analytical formula for thermal stress. The tensile and highly compressive stresses observed in the HfN coating on niobium and HD graphite, respectively, indicated a lower adhesive strength of the coating on the later than that of the former.","Shankar, A.

Effect of ceramic coating on carbon nanotubes interaction with matrix material and mechanical properties of aluminum matrix nanocomposite,"Using a metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) technique and a tungsten hexacarbonyl W(CO)6 as a precursor, a stable and continuous coating consisting of nonstoichiometric WC1-x nanoparticles with sizes from 10 to 30 nm on the surface of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was obtained. The resulting hybrid WC1-x/CNTs structures had a developed surface morphology, which contributed to a more complete realization of the potential of the physical and mechanical properties of CNTs when used as reinforcement in composite materials. Comparative assessment of aluminum matrix nanocomposites AA5049 + 5 wt% CNTs and AA5049 + 5 wt% WC1-x/CNTs obtained by high energy ball milling and subsequent hot consolidation at 450°С shows that the WC1-x ceramic coating on the carbon nanotubes surface acts as a barrier layer at the interface, preventing the Al4C3 in situ formation at the matrix/CNT boundary. Coating of carbon nanotubes with WC1-x nanoparticles leads to a significant increase in the physical and mechanical properties of aluminum matrix nanocomposites, in particular, to an increase in the compressive strength from 810 ± 8 MPa to 893 ± 7 MPa, fracture deformation from 3.7% to 4.9%, Young's modulus from 102 ± 6 GPa to 110 ± 4 GPa, and microhardness from 152 ± 6 HV to 176 ± 8 HV in comparison with using of CNTs in the as-synthesized state.","Aborkin, Artemiy;Babin, Dmitriy;Zalesnov, Alexey;Prusov, Evgeny;Ob'edkov, Anatoly;Alymov, Mikhail",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"Milling,Nanocomposites,Interfaces,Carbides",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.264,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.264
Fabrication of short carbon fibre reinforced SiC multilayer composites by tape casting,"Silicon carbide multilayer composites containing short carbon fibres (Csf/SiC) were prepared by tape casting and pressureless sintering. C fibres were dispersed in solvents and then mixed with SiC slurry to make green Csf/SiC tape. Triton X-100 was found to be the best one for Toho Tenax HTC124 fibres (with water soluble coating) among BYK-163, BYK-410, BYK-2150, BYK-9076, BYK-9077 and Triton X-100 dispersants. Csf/SiC multilayer composites containing 5vol.% fibre (mean fibre length of 3, 4.5, and 6mm) were obtained. Addition of short C fibres seems to worsen the densification process in the Csf/SiC multilayer composites, whereas anisotropy shrinkage in Csf/SiC was also observed. Open pores size was increased slightly after the addition of C fibre but it decreased with the mean fibre length. Mechanical properties were affected by high residual porosity. The addition of short C fibre has not changed the crack deflection at weak interfaces. Csf/SiC multilayer composites containing longer fibres (4.5 and 6mm) presented higher elastic modulus, bending strength and Vickers hardness as compared to shorter fibres (3mm). Improved sintering performance and fibre content are necessary to improve mechanical properties.","Yang, W.S.;Fuso, L.;Biamino, S.;Vasquez, D.;Bolivar, C.

Effect of suspension medium on the electrophoretic deposition of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles and properties of obtained coatings,The suspensions of hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles were prepared in different alcohols. The zeta potential of HA nanoparticles was the highest in butanolic suspension (65.65mV) due to the higher adsorption of RCH2OH2 + species via hydrogen bonding with surface P3OH group of HA. Electrophoretic deposition was performed at 20 and 60V/cm for different times. Deposition rate was faster in low molecular weight alcohols due to the higher electrophoretic mobility of HA nanoparticles in them. The coating deposited from butanolic suspension had the highest adhesion strength and corrosion resistance in SBF solution at 37.5°C. The surface of this coating was covered by apatite after immersion in SBF solution for 1 week.,"Farrokhi-Rad, Morteza;Shahrabi, Taghi",2014-03-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Wetting behavior and mechanism of glass coatings on samarium–cobalt alloys in the heating process,"The wetting behavior of glass coatings on samarium-cobalt alloys with different roughness at elevated temperatures in air was investigated by a sessile drop method. The wetting properties were analyzed through several parameters, including apparent contact angle, height and diameter of a glass cylinder on the samarium-cobalt alloy, determined by using a high temperature microscope. The morphology evolution of the glass coating was observed by using a scanning electron microscope. The results show that the glass cylinder contracts initially, and then swells followed by wetting and spreading on the samarium-cobalt alloy substrate. This process is explained by the role of air and the increase of capillary number. The dependence of apparent contact angle on surface roughness is related to interface reaction. It is concluded that the surface roughness firstly increases the contact angle, but then promotes wetting due to the wetting transition changing from the Cassie−Baxter state to the Wenzel state in the non-reactive wetting range. The surface roughness hinders the spreading of the glass melt due to the interface reaction between glass and samarium-cobalt alloys in the reactive wetting range.","Yu, Xiao-Jie;Li, Yong-Yan;Luo, Zhi-Yong;Wang, Shuai;Han, Wei;Fang, Yi-Kun",2020-10-01,Ceramics International,"Firing,Interface,Glass,Hard magnets,Wettability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.073,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.073
Enhanced rate capability and cycling life of nickel modified Li3V2(PO4)3 cathode material,"Monoclinic Li3V2(PO4)3 (LVP) is an appealing cathode material of Li-ion batteries for its high operation voltage, high capacity and great thermal stability. However, the low electronic conductivity plagues its practical application. Here, LVP/C has been modified by introducing nickel as a coating element via ultrasonic dispersion assisted solid-state reaction. The LVP particles are closely covered with amorphous carbon and mixed with NiO nanoparticles, besides some Ni element enters into the LVP lattice due to the Ni atom thermal diffusion. Compared with carbon coated LVP electrode, due to the increased electronic conductivity, decreased charge-transfer resistance and enhanced lithium ion diffusion coefficient, all the three Ni-modified LVP/C electrodes exhibit enhanced electrochemical performance. Especially when the amount of nickel acetate is 0.06 g (corresponding to 1.0 g LVP/C), the resulting product (LVP/C-6Ni) owns the highest initial capacity of 122 mA h g−1 with a very low capacity fading of ~0.003% per cycle even after 1000 cycles at 1 C. Furthermore, LVP/C-6Ni also displays an outstanding average capacity of 120.6 mA h g−1 at 20 C.","Ding, Xiao-Kai;Li, Tao;Zhang, Lu-Lu;Yang, Xue-Lin;Liang, Gan;Wang, Ji-Qing",2018-05-31,Ceramics International,"Lithium-ion batteries,Cathode,Lithium vanadium phosphate,Nickel-modification",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.261,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.261
Experiments and transient finite element simulation of γ-Y2Si2O7/B2O3-Al2O3-SiO2 glass coating on porous Si3N4 substrate under thermal shock,"A dense γ-Y2Si2O7/B2O3-Al2O3-SiO2 glass coating was fabricated by slurry spraying method on porous Si3N4 ceramic for water resistance. Thermal shock failure was recognized as one of the key failure modes for porous Si3N4 radome materials. In this paper, thermal shock resistance of the coated porous Si3N4 ceramics were investigated through rapid quenching thermal shock experiments and transient finite element analysis. Thermal shock resistance of the coating was tested at 700°C, 800°C, 900°C and 1000°C. Results showed that the cracks initiated within the coating after thermal shock from 800°C to room temperature, thus leading to the reduction of the water resistance. Based on the finite element simulation results, thermal shock failure tended to occur in the coating layer with increasing temperature gradient, and the critical thermal shock failure temperature was measured as 872.24°C. The results obtained from finite element analysis agree well with that from the thermal shock tests, indicating accuracy and feasibility of this numerical simulation method. Effects of thermo-physical properties for the coating material on its thermal shock resistance were also discussed. Thermal expansion coefficient of the coating material played a more decisive role in decreasing the tangent tensile stress.","Fan, Xingyu;Wang, Hongjie;Niu, Min;Zhang, Dahai;Zhou, Jun;Fan, Jinpeng",2018-03-31,Ceramics International,"Porous Si3N4 ceramic,Dense coating,Thermal shock resistance,Crack,Finite element simulation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.205,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.205
Influence of epoxy resin on the microstructure and cavitation erosion of as-sprayed 8YSZ coating,"The microstructures of materials are sensitive to shock waves and microjets induced by bubble collapse. The microstructure of coatings is thus closely related to their cavitation performance. Coating defects always act as the preferential sites for the bubble growth; thus, the materials around pores have been spalled preferentially under strong impact. In this study, epoxy resin (ER) was introduced into as-sprayed 8 wt% yttria-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ) coating by vacuum impregnation to prepare 8YSZ-ER coating. Results showed that the hardness, toughness, cohesive strength, and density of 8YSZ-ER coating are greatly improved. Cavitation performance is also improved; 8YSZ coating exhibited only a deceleration period whereas 8YSZ-ER coating showed a long steady-state period. This finding was mainly attributed to the enhanced compactness and cohesive strength of 8YSZ-ER coating, which caused the impact force to be evenly distributed on the specimen surface without accumulating in the pores. Cracks were also deflected, turned and terminated due to the presence of ER. Moreover, the relationship between ER aging and the damage mechanism of 8YSZ-ER coating under cavitation erosion was also examined.","Deng, Wen;Zhao, Xiaoqin;Ren, Yi;Hao, Enkang;Han, Jiesheng;An, Yulong;Zhou, Huidi;Chen, Jianmin",2019-04-01,Ceramics International,"Microstructure,Cavitation erosion,Epoxy resin,Vacuum impregnation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.034,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.034
Phase stability of ZrO2 9.5Y2O3 5.6Yb2O3 5.2Gd2O3 compound at 1100 °C and 1300 °C for advanced TBC applications,"Phase instability of conventional zirconia compounds (YSZ: Yttria Stabilized Zirconia) at temperatures above 1200 °C, is one of the important reasons of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) destruction in new generation of turbines. In this study, ZGYbY: ZrO2 9.5Y2O3 5.6Yb2O3 5.2Gd2O3 powder, as a new material for TBC applications, was synthesized through a chemical co-precipitation method to enhance the phase stability of the YSZ at higher temperatures. A cyclic method with 5 h cycles at 1100 °C and 1300 °C for 50 h was employed to investigate the phase stability of YSZ and ZGYbY compounds. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) analysis confirmed the phase stability of both of powders during thermal cycling at 1100 °C for 50 h. The results of thermal cycling at 1300 °C for 50 h indicated that ZGYbY powder exhibits excellent phase stability due to full retention of t-prime zirconia phase and restriction of tetragonal to monoclinic phase transition upon cooling. However, in the case of YSZ powder, after thermal cycling at similar condition, it decomposed to two new phases including cubic and monoclinic zirconia with 62 wt% and 38 wt%, respectively.","Bahamirian, M.;Hadavi, S.M.M.;Farvizi, M.;Rahimipour, M.R.;Keyvani, A.",2019-04-15,Ceramics International,"Co-precipitation method,Phase stability,YSZ,ZrO2 9.5Y2O3 5.6Yb2O3 5.2Gd2O3,T-prime ZrO2 phase",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.018
"Influence of doping Mg2+ or Ti4+ captions on the microstructures, thermal radiation and thermal cycling behavior of plasma-sprayed Gd2Zr2O7 coatings","Gadolinium zirconate (Gd2Zr2O7) coatings doped by the transition metal Ti and the alkaline earth metal Mg were expected to have improved thermal radiation performance, which could be combined with their excellent thermal barrier properties to comprehensively improve the thermal insulating performance. The results show that the parent Gd2Zr2O7 powder as well as the Gd-site and Zr-site substituted powders crystallize as pyrochlore Gd2Zr2O7 in Fd-3m space group, while all the as-sprayed coatings have the combination of fluorite and a little part of pyrochlore phase. Gd2Zr2O7 ceramic has high mid-infrared emittance and the addition of Ti4+ into Gd2Zr2O7 can enhance the infrared absorption/emittance in a specific wavenumber range, dominantly in the near-infrared (0.75–2.5 μm) band due to the enhancement of electron transition induced by the impurity energy levels linked to the widening of the conduction band. The normal spectral infrared emissivity of Gd2Zr2O7-based coating was higher than 0.88 at 1073 K. The monolayered doped Gd2Zr2O7 coatings present very low thermal cycling lifetime, similar with the parent coating, mainly related with their low fracture toughness, despite (Gd1-xMgx)2Zr2O7 series display lower thermal conductivity than the parent one.","Wang, Dezheng;Dong, Shujuan;Zeng, Jinyan;Liang, Panpan;Liao, Huiqi;Wang, Yihui;Jiang, Jianing;Deng, Longhui;Zhou, Xin;Cao, Xueqiang",2020-06-15,Ceramics International,"Gd2Zr2O7 coatings,Doping,Plasma spraying,Infrared radiation,Thermal cycling lifetime",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.076,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.076

Evolution of cracks within an Al2O3–40 wt%TiO2/NiCoCrAl gradient coating,"In this paper, an Al2O3–40 wt%TiO2/NiCoCrAl gradient coating is deposited by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS). The microstructure and element distribution of the coating are studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron probe X-ray microanalysis (EPMA). The crack propagation behaviour in the coating under applied and thermal stress is analysed through a three-point bending test and a thermal shock test, respectively. Two rapid propagation processes of the cracks can be found during the three-point bending test, which lead to two peaks in the load-displacement curves of the gradient coating. The gradual change in the composition also has an effect on the crack propagation process within the coating. Non-directional propagation paths of cracks and the formation of oxides can be observed in the gradient region under the effect of thermal stress, which lead to the spallation failure of the coating.","He, Xuan;Song, Peng;Yu, Xiao;Li, Chao;Huang, Taihong;Zhou, Ying;Li, Qiaolei;Lü, Kaiyue;Lü, Jianguo;Lu, Jiansheng",2018-12-01,Ceramics International,"Gradient coating,Al2O3,TiO2,NiCoCrAl,Crack propagation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.081,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.081
Effect of powder particle size on vibration damping behaviour of plasma sprayed alumina (Al2O3) coating on AISI 304 stainless steel substrate,The damping capacity of plasma sprayed alumina (Al2O3) coatings on AISI 304 stainless steel was investigated in this study as a function of particle size of the starting alumina powder. The coatings were prepared from different sizes alumina powder using commercial air plasma spraying (APS) technique. The damping properties of coated samples were characterized by damping capacity (Q−1) measured experimentally using dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA). The surface morphology of the coatings was studied using scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results revealed that the coating was porous and was able to improve the damping capacity of bare substrate. It was also observed that the powder particle size had a significant effect on the damping characteristics of the coatings. The damping values were found to be increased with the increase in particle size in the measured strain range.

Correlation between yttria stabilized zirconia particle size and morphological properties of NiO–YSZ films prepared by spray coating process,"A systematic approach was taken to investigate the morphology of NiO–yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) films deposited by a spray coating process. The final morphological aspects of anode films were influenced by the particle size of YSZ powders and the milling time of the slurries used for film deposition. YSZ powders with average particle size of 17 and 52nm were obtained from powders calcined at 800 and 1000°C, respectively.

EBSD analysis of microstructure changes in YSZ coatings during thermal cycling,"Failure of atmospheric plasma sprayed (APS) yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) coatings is complicated. Therefore, determining the microstructural changes that occur in the top coat during thermal cycling is beneficial to figure out the dominant failure mechanism in thermal barrier coatings. In this study, thermal cycling tests were conducted on YSZ coatings sprayed by APS. For comparison, coatings with the same spray parameters were held at 1100 °C for 25 h. Areas of interest in the cross-sections of the coatings were chosen prior to thermal cycling, in which ex-situ observation and analysis were performed via scanning electron microscope and electron backscatter diffraction. Residual stress values of coatings with different thermal cycling times were measured by X-ray diffraction. The growth of quasi-columnar crystals, which were related to a depletion in Al and an increase in stress, was observed. During thermal loading, the vertical cracks propagate comparatively easier leading to the spallation. The residual stress varies continually during the thermal cycling test and the changes are divided into several stages. The monoclinic phase transformation tends to occurred inside grains, creating compressive stress inside the coating, which improve the longevity of the coating.","Huang, Yiling;Shen, Yitian;Zeng, Yi;Song, Xuemei;Lin, Chucheng;Zhang, Jimei;Guo, Xiang",2020-10-20,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Yttrium stabilized zirconia,Electron backscatter diffraction,Thermal cycling",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.140,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.140
Fabrication and tribological properties of textured diamond coatings on WC-Co cemented carbide surfaces,"This study aimed to investigate the influence of texture structure on the tribological property of diamond coating on the various surface texture of WC-Co cemented carbide surfaces. The surface texture was fabricated by laser ablation technology. The diamond coating was coated on the textured cemented carbide surface by adopting the hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD) method. The tribological properties of untextured and textured diamond coatings were measured utilizing a reciprocating ball-on-plate friction test against GCr15 bearing ball. The test was done under the condition of dry frictions at room temperature. The experimental results revealed that the diamond coatings were perfectly superimposed on the surface texture. The diamond coating's secondary nucleation rate at the edge of the texture was more obvious than other places. Furthermore, the texture type and texture surface area had a conspicuous impact on the friction coefficient and wear resistance of diamond coating under dry friction state. For the same type of textures, the friction coefficient of textured diamond coating considerably decreased with the increase of texture surface area. The elliptical textures were found to further reduce the friction coefficient of diamond coatings by capturing abrasive particles, compared to the grooved texture. Machining textures on diamond films was an effective method to improve the tribological properties of the friction pair.","Guo, Zhenhai;Deng, Fuming;Zhang, Lei;Hao, Cen;Zhao, Xin;Xiang, Daohui",2020-10-17,Ceramics International,"Laser ablation technology,HFCVD,Textured diamond coating,Friction test,Wear resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.124,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.124
Hot corrosion behavior of ZrB2-HfB2 solid solutions in KCl and K2SO4 at 1500°C,"Novel electrode coating materials are needed for coal-fired magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) direct-current extraction power plants. Addition of potassium salt to increase the conductivity of coal plasma combined with high temperature render the service conditions extremely arduous. Therefore, the electrode coating materials must possess certain properties including high-temperature corrosion resistance, high-temperature oxidation resistance, and adequate electrical conductivity. In this work, those very properties of three different compositions of transition metal diboride solid solutions of HfB2-ZrB2 are studied. Two main approaches of oxidation mitigation methods were employed: adding chemical dopants, such as Hf and La, and performing pre-anodization on the samples to create a protective oxide coating. Thermogravimetric experiments were run at different partial pressures of oxygen to determine the high-temperature oxidation resistance of these boride ceramics. In addition, two different salt coatings (KCl and K2SO4) were applied to the surface of the samples to test their hot corrosion resistance. High-temperature polarization resistance tests were also conducted to measure the electrical resistivity. The addition of lanthanum aided in long term oxidation and corrosion protection, with a parabolic rate constant, Kp = 1.33 × 10−5 kg2/m4 s, a 40% improvement over the sample without the addition of lanthanum under the same conditions. Anodization, however, proved disadvantageous when combined with either lanthanum or a corrosive environment.","Sitler, Steven J.;Raja, Krishnan S.;Charit, Indrajit",2017-12-15,Ceramics International,"Magnetohydrodynamics,Oxidation resistance,Hot corrosion,UHTC,Transition metal diborides,Anodization",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.122,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.122
Modification of surface morphology to enhance tribological properties for CVD coated cutting tools through wet micro-blasting post-process,"Coated cemented carbide tools have been widely applied in high performance machining due to their excellent heat resistance and anti-wear properties. However, as-deposited tool coatings are still challenged by the growing requirements to further enhance cutting performance. Wet micro-blasting post-process on coating tools has been proposed to improve mechanical properties and increase tool life. This paper aims to optimize the wet micro-blasting operating parameters for chemical vapor deposition (CVD) coated tools to strengthen their wear resistance. The surface morphology of three types of CVD coated tools including TiN/Al2O3/TiCN, thin Al2O3/TiCN and thick Al2O3/TiCN are inspected with EDS, SEM and AFM. Tribological properties for both as-deposited and wet micro-blasted tool coatings were evaluated by dry reciprocating sliding tests. The measured results indicate that the wet micro-blasting process can significantly decrease the surface roughness and improve the wear resistance. Among the wet micro-blasting operating parameters, the wet micro-blasting time and the abrasive particle size are found to play more important roles in the formatting of top surface morphology and the enhancement of the tribological behavior than the role played by blasting pressure. Based on the research results, the CVD tool coatings with improved anti-wear properties and surface topography can be fabricated with suitable wet micro-blasting process parameters.","Liu, Canyu;Liu, Zhanqiang;Wang, Bing",2018-02-15,Ceramics International,"Wet micro-blasting,CVD,Tool coating,Microstructure,Tribology",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.142,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.142
"Mechanical, biocorrosion, and antibacterial properties of nanocrystalline TiN coating for orthopedic applications","The current study analyzes the surface, mechanical, biocorrosion, and antibacterial performances of a nanocrystalline TiN ceramic coating synthesized using cathodic arc-physical vapor deposition (PVD) on biomedical Ti6Al4V substrates. The surface hardness and modulus of elasticity were assessed using the microindentation method. The adhesion, friction coefficient, and antibacterial properties of the coating were evaluated. The in vitro corrosion of the prepared coated Ti alloy substrate was analyzed in simulated body fluid (SBF) via cyclic potentiodynamic polarization (CPP), dynamic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (DEIS), and scanning vibrating electrochemical technique (SVET). The results demonstrated that a nanocrystalline TiN coating with a crystallite size of 10.33 nm and a thickness of 5 μm was formed with good adhesion on the alloy surface. The coating had an enhanced surface hardness of 38.63 GPa and a modulus elasticity of 358 GPa, and exhibited enhanced resistance to plastic deformation compared with the substrate – features that can enhance the service life of an implant. The antibacterial experiments indicated an upgraded antibacterial performance of the TiN coating compared to the bare alloy. The in vitro corrosion-resistance analyses confirmed the enhanced surface protective performance of TiN ceramic coatings against biocorrosion in SBF. The results showed higher impedance values in DEIS, a higher passive region in the CPP analysis, and a lower anodic current density in the SVET analysis compared with the bare substrate.","Hussein, M.A.;Ankah, N.K.;Kumar, A.

Multi-response optimization of mechanical properties for ZrWN films grown using grey Taguchi approach,"ZrWN nitride films are prepared using direct current (dc) reactive magnetron sputtering. Grey Taguchi analysis is used to determine the effect of deposition parameters (substrate plasma etching time, N2/(N2+Ar) flow rates, deposition time, and substrate temperature) on the microstructure and the tribological properties. An orthogonal array, signal-to-noise ratio and analysis of variance are used to determine the effects of deposition parameters. The substrates are pretreated using oxygen plasma etching. The resulting ZrWN coatings are homogeneous, very compact and completely adhered to the substrate. In the confirmation runs, using grey Taguchi analysis, the coefficient of friction decreases from 0.45 ± 0.02 to 0.35 ± 0.02, the corrosion potential increases from − 0.201 ± 0.01 to − 0.072 ± 0.01 V, the Vickers hardness increases from 23.63 ± 0.07 to 24.65 ± 0.05 GPa, and reduced modulus increases from 115.82 ± 1.13 to 136.17 ± 1.18 GPa.

Post-hydrothermal treatment of hydrothermal electrodeposited CaHPO4 on C/C composites in sodium silicate-containing solution at various temperatures,"Direct deposition of hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings on carbon/carbon(C/C) composites through hydrothermal electrochemical deposition (HED) were limited by the poor bonding strength. To overcome this problem，in this work, CaHPO4 (monetite) coating was firstly deposited on C/C using HED, and then converted into HA coating in a sodium silicate–containing solution by post-hydrothermal treatment. Effects of post-treatment temperatures on the chemical composition, structure, and bonding strength of the coatings were investigated. The results showed that obtained monetite showed a compact microstructure, and could react with the solution to produce a well-crystallized HA as well as amorphous silicate which contained some calcium and sodium ions. All the coatings were composed of rod-like crystals. The diameter of these crystals increased when the post-hydrothermal temperature was changed from 110 ℃ to 140 ℃, and then decreased at 155 ℃. The Si contents and the adhesive strength of the HA coatings showed a similar temperature dependence to the crystal size of the HA. 140 ℃ is determined to the optimal treatment temperature, at which the HA coating reached the highest critical load of 24.02 N, corresponding to the shear strength of 82.83 MPa.

Laser ablation behavior and mechanism of C/SiC coated with ZrB2 –MoSi2–SiC/Mo prepared by HVOF,"Recently, carbon fiber-reinforced silicon carbide (C/SiC) composites are considered important candidates for laser protection materials. In this paper, the ablation mechanism of C/SiC composites and their modified composites under laser irradiation was studied. ZrB2–MoSi2–SiC ternary-phase ceramic was successfully coated on C/SiC composites by using high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) technology, with Mo as transition layer. The evolution of phase and morphology of the composites was investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The ablation behavior of composites was investigated by laser confocal microscopy (LCM). The results showed that the ablation mechanism of composites was controlled by phase transformation, thermal reaction and thermal diffusion. The solid-liquid transition of ZrB2 and MoSi2 was the dominant factor. Thermal reaction and good thermal diffusivity of coatings were also important factors affecting the ablation performance. ZrB2–SiC– MoSi2/Mo coating failed when all phase transitions were completed and no continuous liquid phase was formed, followed by rapid damage of C/SiC substrate.

Effect of volume fraction on mechanical properties of Zr/ZrN multilayer systems,"In this paper we study the effect of volumetric fraction and bilayer modulation period (Λ) on mechanical properties of metal/ceramic multilayer coatings. Two sets of Zr/ZrN multilayer systems with different modulation period and volumetric fraction were synthesized by DC reactive magnetron sputtering. The crystalline structure of the multilayers films was determined by X-ray diffraction and morphology were analyzed by AFM and TEM, which show that crystalline films are formed in all cases. High resolution TEM analysis revealed well-formed multilayer composites with very smooth layers. Nanoindentation tests were carried out to measure the mechanical properties of the multilayer Zr/ZrN coating. Hardness (H), elastic modulus (E) and elastic recovery (We) were determined by using the Oliver and Pharr method, the values are also discussed in terms of H 3 /E 2 ratio. The results show that mechanical properties varied according to volumetric fraction Zr/ZrN. However, coatings with metallic volume fraction between 10% and 20% showed a significant improvement in hardness of 16–21% in comparison with monolithic ZrN values. Moreover, the best values for elastic recovery and resistance to plastic deformation (H 3 /E 2 ) also were found in Zr/ZrN multilayer with 10–20% of metallic phase, increasing up to 12% on We and up to 79% on H 3 /E 2 .

The effect of calcination temperature on physicochemical properties and electrochemical performance of Al-coated LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 materials are investigated by using the X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The electrochemical properties of as-prepared materials showed that the C-500 sample (calcined at 500 °C) has excellent cycling performance and rate capability. Meanwhile, even at high operation temperature (55 °C), the capacity retention is 88% after 50 cycles at a rate of 0.5 C. Moreover, the crystal structure and surface morphology of C-500 sample after 200 cycles are also studied. All the results indicated that the composite coating layer with Al2O3 and LiAlO2 can not only reduce the side reactions at the electrode and electrolyte interface, but also provide an effective channel for the diffusion of Li+ in the charge/discharge process.","Shu, Yang;Xie, Yin;Yan, Wenchao;Meng, Su;Sun, Deye;Jin, Yongcheng;Xiang, Lan",2020-07-31,Ceramics International,"Lithium ion battery,LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4,Composition coating layer,Cycle performance,Rate capability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.009

The thermal shock behavior of the two as-sprayed TBCs at 1000°C was investigated. The results indicated that the thermal cycling lifetime of 7YSZ TBCs was longer than the 5SYSZ TBCs due to the lower thermal mismatch stress between the ceramic layer and the metallic layer at high temperature. However, the nanostructured 5SYSZ coating had higher thermal stability than 7YSZ TBC.","Loghman-Estarki, Mohammad Reza;Shoja Razavi, Reza;Edris, Hossein;pourbafrany, Mousa;Jamali, Hossein;ghasemi, Reza",2014-01-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Wet abrasive behavior of composite materials obtained from solid residuals mixed with polymer and ceramic matrix,"In this study, the performance of composite materials subjected to wet abrasive wear was analyzed. This research conducted to know the resistance of these materials against this specific wear process. The types of composites used in this study could have useful applications such as coatings to protect mechanical components, including engine pistons, steam generators, and construction materials, such as bricks and shutters. These materials obtained from solid residuals known as “jales” (náhualt word that means sand) and volcanic ashes coming from mines mixed with a polymeric (epoxy and polyester resin) and ceramic (clay) matrix. The materials formed were sand mixed with clay, volcanic ashes mixed with clay, sand with epoxy resin and sand with polyester resin. The abrasion testing performed in accordance with ASTM G105 standard and the samples had a rectangular shape, and their dimensions were 50mm long×23mm wide and 10mm in thickness. Silica sand used as the abrasive particle with a grain size of 212–300μm and a hardness of 1250HV and mixed with water to conduct the tests. The amount of abrasive and water in the mix was 1.5kg and 0.94kg, respectively. A nominal rubber wheel rotation of 250rpm (2.28m/s), a sliding distance of 840m and a load of 222N were the parameters used to conduct the tests. The total time for each test was 1500 cycles. The specimen weighed before and after every test to determine the total mass loss. The volume loss (V), wear rates (Q) and wear coefficients (k) obtained after 840m, although these wear values monitored every 140m. The surface of the specimens examined with Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The wear mechanisms observed commonly on the specimens were parallel deep grooves and plowing and severe cutting action on the surfaces. The results indicated that the composite material that consisted of sand with epoxy resin exhibited the highest resistance to wet abrasion for all the tests. On the other hand, sand mixed with volcanic ashes with clay showed the poorest abrasion resistance.","Vite-Torres, J.;Vite-Torres, M.;Laguna-Camacho, J.R.;Escalante-Martínez, J.E.;Gallardo-Hernández, E.A.;Vera-Cardenas, E.E.",2014-08-31,Ceramics International,"Wet abrasive behavior,Composite materials,Solid residuals,Polymer matrix,Ceramic matrix",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.02.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.02.001
Performance of TBCs system due to the different thicknesses of top ceramic layer,"Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) with thicknesses of 200μm and 400μm were sprayed using supersonic plasma spraying (SPS) on FeNi-based substrate and Ni-based substrate, respectively. Bonding strengths of FeNi-based substrate and Ni-based substrate with different thicknesses of coatings were investigated. Bonding strength tests revealed different fracture mechanisms for the specimens with thin topcoat and thick topcoat. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and metallographic microscope observation of the crossing sections revealed that the porosity of the thin coating was smaller than that of the thick coating, and the distribution of the porosity further determines the location of the fracture zones. Thermally grown oxide (TGO) with different thicknesses grows on the interface of the bond coat (BC) and top ceramic layer due to oxidation. Analysis validates that thickness of the topcoat plays an important role in the diffusion of oxygen and oxidation rate of the TGO while the porosity has little effect on the oxidation rate.","Fang, Xufei;Zhang, Guobing;Feng, Xue",2015-03-31,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,Ceramic layer thickness,Porosity,Oxidation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.10.105,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.10.105
Effect of tungsten based coating characteristics on microstructure and thermal conductivity of diamond/Cu composites prepared by pressueless infiltration,"Tungsten coatings were deposited on diamond particles by vacuum magnetron sputtering. The coated diamond particles were firstly heat treated at different temperatures, and diamond/copper (Cu) composites were fabricated by using a pressureless infiltration method afterwards. The influences of heat treatment on the microstructure and composition of tungsten based coating surface and diamond/copper composites were analysed. Notable differences were found in the microstructure with heating temperatures. Moreover, the tungsten based coating surface contained large quantities of oxidised tungsten, and the phase composition of the coatings varied within the range of tungsten–W2C–WC as the heat treatment temperature increased. The fracture surface morphologies in the copper matrix composites reinforced with diamond particles with coatings were identically characterised with the presence of ductile fracture of matrix accompanied by dissociation of diamond particles from the matrix. The thermal conductivity (TC) and gas tightness behaviours of the diamond/copper composites were also explored. A maximum TC of 768 W m−1 K−1 and a fine gas tightness of 2.5 × 10-10 Pa m3/s were obtained with reinforcement of tungsten-coated diamond particles treated at 800 °C. The value of the interface thermal resistance between copper and diamond particles was also estimated and specifically discussed.","Jia, Jinhao;Bai, Shuxin;Xiong, Degan;Wang, Jie;Chang, Jin",2019-06-01,Ceramics International,"Diamond/Cu composites,Tungsten coating,Heat treatment,Thermal conductivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.156,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.156
Influence of temperature on tribological properties of microarc oxidation coating on 7075 aluminium alloy at 25 °C –300 °C,"The high-temperature tribological properties of bare 7075 Al – Zn – Mg – Cu alloy substrate and microarc oxidation (MAO) coating against ZrO2 ceramic ball were evaluated at 25 °C −300 °C. Coefficients of friction were recorded, and wear rates were determined. Surface morphology and wear scars on the ZrO2 ball were observed. Furthermore, wear mechanisms at three different temperatures were discussed. It was found that the MAO coating could maintain a low wear rate and a stable wear performance in an elevated temperature environment. At 300 °C, the wear rate of MAO coating was merely 1/11 of 7075 aluminium alloy substrate. MAO coating suffered mainly adhesive wear at ambient temperature, and both adhesive wear and abrasive wear at elevated temperatures.","Yang, Xuan;Chen, Lin;Jin, Xiaoyue;Du, Jiancheng;Xue, Wenbin",2019-06-15,Ceramics International,"High-temperature wear,Microarc oxidation,7075 aluminium alloy,Wear mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.146,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.146
"Microstructural, corrosion and nanomechanical behaviour of ceramic coatings developed on magnesium AZ31 alloy by micro arc oxidation","Microstructural, corrosion and nanomechanical behaviour of micro arc oxidised (MAO) coating grown on magnesium AZ31B alloy was evaluated. Microstructural characterization of the coating was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) followed by image analysis and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX). Linear polarization technique was used to evaluate the corrosion behaviour of the MAO coating. Further, nanoindentation was employed to evaluate nanohardness and Young’s modulus of the MAO coating. The characteristic values of both the nanohardness and the Young’s modulus were calculated through the application of the Weibull statistics.","Dey, Arjun;Rani, R.Uma;Thota, Hari Krishna;Sharma, Anand Kumar;Bandyopadhyay, Payel;Mukhopadhyay, Anoop Kumar",2013-04-30,Ceramics International,"Micro arc oxidation,Microstructure,Nanoindentation,Linear polarization",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.10.020,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.10.020
Influence of the annealing temperature and metal salt precursor on the structural characteristics and anti-corrosion barrier effect of CeO2 sol–gel protective coatings of carbon steel,"Metal corrosion protection is one of the most important challenges in the world; moreover, the need for replacement of hazardous chromates in barrier coatings is of tremendous interest. Thus, we report the development of ceramic cerium oxide coatings by the sol–gel method on carbon steel substrates to improve their corrosion resistance and compare the influence of the use of ceric ammonium nitrate and cerium chloride as metal salt precursors. Different calcination temperatures (200, 300, 400 or 500°C) and heating rates (1 or 5°Cmin−1) of the deposited coatings were also used for synthesis of the coatings and their corrosion behavior was investigated through potentiostatic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy experiments. Electrochemical results indicated that the ceria coatings deposited using ceric ammonium nitrate at 200°C and 5°Cmin−1 are very efficient in the corrosion protection of carbon steel, thus diminishing the current density of corrosion by two orders of magnitude and shifting the corrosion potential by 380mV to more positive values when compared with bare carbon steel. The physical characterization of the sol–gel coatings carried out by atomic force microscopy and X-ray diffraction pointed out that the use of low calcination temperatures yielded homogeneous and non-cracked surfaces of ceramic cerium oxides with improved anticorrosive efficiency. By contrast, the use of high temperatures results in cracked surfaces of crystalline ceramic ceria with poor anticorrosion efficiency and also probably provokes the diffusion of components from the alloy to the coating–substrate interface. Furthermore, the use of ceric ammonium nitrate as cerium precursor resulted in the most resistive coatings for all the temperatures and heating rates studied here.","Carvalho, João B.R.;Silva, Ronaldo S.;Cesarino, Ivana;Machado, Sergio A.S.;Eguiluz, Katlin I.B.;Cavalcanti, Eliane B.;Salazar-Banda, Giancarlo R.",2014-09-30,Ceramics International,"A.

Rietveld analysis of ferroelectric PbZr0.525Ti0.475O3 thin films,"A procedure to obtain all the components of crystal structure by simultaneous Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction pattern collected is described. The specimens used were lead zircone titanate (PZT) thin films prepared by chemical solution deposition (CSD) and deposited on Si (100) and Si (100)/Pt (200) substrates. The growth condition to obtain high quality epytaxial of thin lead zircone titanate was carried out by spin coating at angular velocities 2500, 3000, 3500rpm for 30s and they were annealed at 750°C for 3h. We made single and multi layers films. For 21 specimens with different treatments, we have refined eight parameters which include lattice parameters, background, absorption coefficient, atomic positions, two theta zero error, thermal factors, and profile peak functions. Most of the samples show that the crystal structures are tetragonal with space group P4mm. Thermal effect and profile function refinement make were fitted better than other effect in the refinement. The plane orientations (100) and (200) sometimes were noticed as an effect of substrate, but it was confirmed indeed the growth of PZT thin film.","Yogaraksa, Teguh;Hikam, Muhammad;Irzaman,",2004-12-31,Ceramics International,"D.

Enhanced luminescence properties of phosphors coated by silica nano-layers: Study of reflection and emission,"We present a comprehensive investigation of the YVO4:1 mol% Eu3+ phosphor, synthesized via a facile solid-state approach. Different amounts of TEOS were used to coat the surface of phosphors by SiO2 via sol-gel method. It was found experimentally that covering the surface of phosphors by specific amounts of silica results in the improvement of phosphors emission intensity. Individually, by calculating the reflection coefficient of YVO4 and YVO4/SiO2 phosphors and also using the classical electromagnetic concepts, it was shown that the existence of silica layers on YVO4 particles reduces the reflection of the excitation beam, which is in good agreement with the reinforced emission behavior. Experimentally, upon the collision of UV light with the wavelength of 310 nm, the strongest photoluminescence emission is achieved when the thickness of the SiO2 layer is approximately 50 nm. This result is consistent with the optimum thickness calculated via the reflection coefficient and also the Beer-Lambert law.","Rafiaei, Seyed Mahdi;Ashrafi, Fatemeh;Sayyadi-Shahraki, Ahmad;Karimzadeh, Elmira",2019-02-01,Ceramics International,"Solid-state,Sol-gel,Silica,Coating,Reflection,Photoluminescence",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.044,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.044
Preparation and characterization of multilayer mesoporous alumina nano membrane via sol–gel method using new precursors,"In the present study, a mesoporous γ-alumina layer was coated on a macroporous α-alumina support via sol–gel method to produce a multilayer mesoporous alumina membrane with high performance. Different parameters like homogeneity of colloidal solution, additive, working temperature, roughness of the membrane surface, membrane thickness and porosity of the membrane were analyzed. Two types of new different solvents and additives were considered and compared to have a perfect colloidal sol. A crack-free γ-alumina membrane was obtained by adding Poly Vinyl Alcohol to the alumina solution in an optimum conditions. In order to investigate the thermal stability of the membrane, it was dried and heated up to 600°C. The alumina sols showed particle size distributions in the range of 20–55nm which was measured by a DLS zeta sizer. The roughness of the sub-layers was measured using a Roughness Checker and density and porosity were measured based on Archimedes principle. X-ray diffraction technique (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize the membrane layer.

Effect of co-deposited SiC nanowires and carbon nanotubes on oxidation resistance for SiC-coated C/C composites,"To protect carbon/carbon composites (C/Cs) against oxidation, SiC coating toughened by SiC nanowires (SiCNWs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) hybrid nano-reinforcements was prepared on C/Cs by a two-step technique involving electrophoretic co-deposition and reactive melt infiltration. Co-deposited SiCNWs and CNTs with different shapes including straight-line, fusiform, curved and bamboo dispersed uniformly on the surface of C/Cs forming three-dimensional networks, which efficiently refined the SiC grains and meanwhile suppressed the cracking deflection of the coating during the fabrication process. The presence of SiCNWs and CNTs contributed to the formation of continuous glass layer during oxidation, while toughed the coating by introducing toughing methods such as bridging effect, crack deflection and nanowire pull out. Results showed that after oxidation for 45h at 1773K, the weight loss percentage of SiC coated specimen was 1.35%, while the weight gain percentage of the SiCNWs/CNTs reinforced SiC coating was 0.03052% due to the formation of continuous glass layer. After being exposed for 100h, the weight loss percentage of the SiCNWs/CNTs reinforced SiC coating was 1.08%, which is relatively low.","Huo, Caixia;Guo, Lingjun;Li, Yunyu;Wang, Changcong;Feng, Lei;Liu, Ningkun;Zhang, Yulei;Dong, Kaiyuan;Song, Qiang",2017-02-01,Ceramics International,"Co-deposition,Carbon nanotubes,SiC nanowires,Carbon/carbon composites,SiC coating,Oxidation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.08.196,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.08.196
Processing of Zn-Substituted calcium silicate layers on Y-Tzp bioceramics by dip coating,"Ceramic layers based on calcium silicate non-substituted and substituted by Zn with different thickness, were developed by immersing porous Y-TZP disks into SiO2–CaO–ZnO–P2O5 glass suspensions with ZnO contents in the range of 0–20 mol%. The effect of the disk surface porosity and the slip solid loading on the formation of the dip coated layer was investigated. Special emphasis was given to the ZnO content of the dip coating slurries and its influence on the thickness and composition of the sintered layer. The greater chemical stability of the 20 mol% ZnO-substituted glass powder during aqueous colloidal processing resulted in slips with low viscosity values; whereas the high dissolution rate of the glass having 10 mol% ZnO significantly increased the slip viscosity. The liquid entrainment mechanism at the initial stage was accelerated either by using 10 mol% ZnO-substituted glass slips or by increasing the slip solid loading. The casting rate for longer immersion times markedly increased by increasing the surface porosity of Y-TZP disks. Sintered layers with thickness ~30–70% lower were produced using the glass dip coating slip with 20 mol% ZnO in comparison to 10 mol% ZnO. The main crystalline phase of the coated sintered layers was Ca3Si3O9, Ca2ZnSi2O7 and ZnSiO4 for the glasses with 0, 10 and 20 mol% ZnO, respectively.","Bruni, Yesica L.;Puleston, Thomas P.;Albano, María P.",2020-07-31,Ceramics International,"Bioceramics,Zn-substituted calcium silicate coatings on Y-TZP,Dip coating,Layer formation rate,Microstructure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.044,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.044

Hot corrosion behavior of Lu2SiO5 and La2SiO5 in a molten Na2SO4 environment: A first-principles corrosion resistance investigation,"The hot corrosion behavior of Lu2SiO5 and La2SiO5 (RE2SiO5, RE: rare earth) under Na2SO4 attack was investigated at temperatures ranging from 900 to 1100 °C. First-principles quantum mechanical calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT) were used to obtain the electronic structures of RE2SiO5. The results indicated that the hot corrosion behavior of these compounds depended on their crystal structure and the structural stability of various corrosion products. First-principles results revealed that the RE–O bond was easier to break than the Si–O bond under molten Na2SO4 corrosion environment. In this process, Na+ cations partly substitute RE3+ cations to form NaRE silicates. Once NaRESiO4 was initially formed, cyclosilicate and apatite phases were produced sequentially as the temperature and extent of corrosion increased. In addition, Lu2SiO5 exhibited higher corrosion stability than La2SiO5 because of the lower distortion of the RE–O coordinated polyhedral. The Lu–O bonds showed higher bonding strengths than the La–O bonds as revealed by the density of state (DOS) and Mulliken population analyses. Furthermore, the stability of the formed NaRESiO4 increased upon decreasing the size of the RE3+ cation. Therefore, Lu2SiO5 was more readily formed than NaLuSiO4, and La2SiO5 was prone to form oxyapatite NaLa9Si6O26 after undergoing corrosion with Na2SO4. Overall, Lu2SiO5 showed better corrosion resistance to Na2SO4 than La2SiO5.","Jiang, Fengrui;Cheng, Laifei;Wei, Hanjun;Wang, Yiguang",2019-08-15,Ceramics International,"Hot corrosion,Lu2SiO5,La2SiO5,Na2SO4,First-principles calculations,Environmental barrier coatings",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.058,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.058
Synthesis and microstructure of Gd2O3-doped HfO2 ceramics,"The effect of Gd2O3-doping on the crystal structure, surface morphology and chemical composition of the Gd2O3–HfO2 system is reported. Gd2O3–HfO2 ceramics with variable composition were prepared by varying the Gd2O3 composition in the range of 0–38mol% balanced HfO2. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicates that the Gd2O3 concentration influences the crystal structure of the Gd2O3–HfO2 ceramics. Pure HfO2 and Gd2O3 crystallize in monoclinic and body centered cubic structure, respectively. The Gd2O3–HfO2 ceramics exhibit mixed monoclinic and fluorite structure when the Gd2O3 concentration is varied from 4 to 12mol%. At 20mol% of Gd2O3, existence of only the fluorite phase was found. Increasing the Gd2O3 concentration to 38mol% results in the formation of single-phase pyrochlore Gd2Hf2O7 (a =5.258Å).","Roy, C.K.;Noor-A-Alam, M.;Choudhuri, A.R.;Ramana, C.V.",2012-04-30,Ceramics International,"Gd2O3–HfO2 ceramics,Crystal structure,Phase transformations,Thermal barrier coatings,X-ray diffraction,Scanning electron microscopy",10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.10.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.10.002
Microstructure effects on fracture failure mechanism of CrAl/CrAlN coating,"In this work, the Metal-rich phase Chromium Aluminum (CrAl)/Ceramic phase Chromium Aluminum Nitride (CrAlN) multi-layer coatings were prepared by Arc Ion Plating (AIP). The micro-structure and phase composition of CrAl/CrAlN multi-layer coatings were characterized, and the microstructure, mechanical properties, residual stress and fracture toughness of the coating were emphatically analyzed. It has been found out that the residual stress of the multi-layer coating was only −0.932 ± 0.065 GPa, which was significantly lower than that of the mono-layer coating for −1.569 ± 0.093 GPa. At the same time, it was also found that the preferred growth orientation of the coating changed from a mono-layer (111) to a multi-layer (200) crystal plane. The hardness of the multi-layer (22.74 ± 0.57 GPa) is slightly lower than that of the mono-layer (24.92 ± 0.5 GPa), and the adhesion strength (46.2 ± 3.8 N) is obviously higher than that of the mono-layer (37.4 ± 2.4 N), and the fracture toughness is also higher (8.7 ± 0.8 MPa m1/2).

Accurate residual stress measurement as a function of depth in environmental barrier coatings via a combination of X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy,"This study examined the properties of the latest generation of rare earth silicate environmental barrier coating system (EBCs). By combining X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, a novel and efficient method was developed to measure residual stress in EBCs produced by slurry coating. A 633-nm-wavelength laser beam from the confocal microlaser of a Raman spectrometer was focused on the cross-section of samples, and the spectra were recorded. We performed non-linear multi-peak spectrum fitting with the Lorenz function to obtain the peak shift of the EBC top coat at 5 μm intervals as a function of depth. We then obtained the stress distribution along the depth by calibrating the stress value on the surface via X-ray diffraction. The residual stress in the coating which endured high temperature, water, and oxygen corrosion without serious damage, was non-uniform and compressive. The stress at the bottom of the coating was approximately −275 MPa, decreasing towards the surface. A sudden shift in stress value was observed in the distribution of the residual stress, which was attributed to residual stress relaxation caused by microscopic pores contained within the coating.","Ye, Cheng;Jiang, Peng",2020-06-01,Ceramics International,"Environmental barrier coating,Residual stress,X-ray diffraction,Laser Raman spectroscopy",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.025
"Supersonically sprayed clay, silica, and silica aerogel hybrid films as thermal and electrical barriers","A thermal barrier coating (TBC) provides protection from thermal damage.

The coated films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The effects of varied coating thicknesses from 1 to 5 mm on the TBC performance of each material were studied for both heating and cooling scenarios.

Microstructural and thermal properties of plasma sprayed mullite coatings,"Thick mullite (3Al2O3–2SiO2) coatings were fabricated by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) in a mixture of crystalline and amorphous phases, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The coatings were isothermally heat treated in order to study recrystallization mechanism of the glassy phase. The morphology and the microstructure of both mullite feedstock and coatings were investigated by using scansion electron microscopy (SEM). The porosity of as-sprayed coating was in the range between 2 and 3% and substantially remained unchanged after thermal treatment. The thermal expansion of as-sprayed and annealed coatings was measured during heating up to the temperature of crystallization and the corresponding high-temperature extent of shrinkage was calculated. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves at different heating rates showed a sharp exothermic peak between 1243 and 1253K, suggesting a rapid recrystallization of the amorphous phase.

Facile construction of silica-based surface coating onto polypropylene microporous film through dopamine-assisted hydrolysis of tetraethoxysilane,"Surface modification with silica-based coating is widely used to attain high performance and construct special functions for thin films. In this paper, dopamine (DA) and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) were used as initial building blocks to construct a biomimetic hydrophilic and mechanical robust silica-based coating onto polypropylene (PP) microporous film. It was found that the final DA/TEOS coating can be steadily immobilized onto PP film and greatly improve the hydrophilic property of PP film as evidenced by the decreased contact angle. Furthermore, the coating structures were comparatively investigated through one-step synthesis and two-step synthesis of DA and TEOS with a fixed ratio. Interestingly, the one-step synthesized coating possesses a loosely-packed layer with dispersed SiO2 nanoparticles within polydopamine matrix while the two-step synthesized coating shows a high loading of SiO2 nanoparticles. As a result, the two-step approach leads to a continuous SiO2 layer with abundant hydroxyl groups, indicating a better lyophilic property and depressed thermal shrinkage. In addition, the concentric SiO2 layer results in a significant increase of the tensile strength of PP films.","Zhao, Yongsheng;Si, Lianmeng;Dang, Wanbin;Lu, Zhaoqing",2018-06-15,Ceramics International,"Silica-based coating,Polydopamine(PDA),Lyophilic property,Mechanical property,Dimensional stability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.009
"Microstructure and properties of monolayer, bilayer and multilayer Ta2O5-based coatings on biomedical Ti-6Al-4V alloy by magnetron sputtering","In recent years, tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) ceramic coating has attracted considerable attention in the modification of implants due to its excellent biocompatibility, high corrosion resistance, and good wear resistance. However, the poor adhesion to the substrate degrades its performance and may become a significant obstacle to its clinical application. In the paper, Ta2O5 monolayer, Ta2O5/Ti bilayer, and Ta2O5/Ta2O5-Ti/Ti multilayer coatings were prepared on the Ti-6Al-4V alloy by magnetron sputtering. The microstructure, chemical composition, residual thermal stress, adhesion strength, mechanical properties, tribological behaviors, and corrosion resistance of the coatings were investigated and compared. The results showed that these deposited coatings were composed of an amorphous nano-Ta2O5 phase, and their surfaces were smooth, dense, and homogeneous without any cracks. Ta2O5/Ta2O5-Ti/Ti coatings exhibited lower thermal residual stress than that of the Ta2O5 and Ta2O5/Ti coatings, which could be attributed to the decrease of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch between the Ta2O5 film and Ti-6Al-4V substrate due to the introduction of the Ta2O5-Ti/Ti double-interlayer. Moreover, Ta2O5/Ta2O5-Ti/Ti coating was significantly superior to Ta2O5 and Ta2O5/Ti coatings in the adhesion strength, mechanical properties, and wear resistance. These Ta2O5-based coatings can provide excellent corrosion protection for Ti-6Al-4V alloy in simulated body fluids (SBF). The Ta2O5 monolayer coating samples showed the best corrosion resistance, mainly due to its thick out-layer Ta2O5 film. These experimental results provide a feasible way to improve the performances of Ta2O5 coating on Ti-6Al-4V alloy.","Ding, Zeliang;Zhou, Quan;Wang, Yi;Ding, Ziyu;Tang, Yinghong;He, Quanguo",2020-08-30,Ceramics International,"Tantalum pentoxide,Ti-6Al-4V,Ceramic coating,Magnetron sputtering",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.230,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.230

However, the rate performance and cycling stability of these cathode materials are not satisfactory. Inspired by the characteristics of Y2O3 production, a new cathode material with ultrathin-Y2O3 coating was introduced to improve the electrochemical performance and storage properties of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 for the first time.

The impacts on the electrochemical properties with or without Y2O3 coating are discussed in detail. Notably, galvanostatic discharge-charge tests appear that Y2O3-coated sample especially 3% coating displayed a better capacity retention rate of 91.45% after 100 cycles than the bare one of 85.07%.","Dai, Shican;Yuan, Mingliang;Wang, Long;Luo, Liming;Chen, Qichao;Xie, Tangfeng;Li, Yaping;Yang, Yuting",2019-01-31,Ceramics International,"Electrode materials,Y2O3 coating,Lithium ion batteries,Electrochemical performance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.227,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.227
Degradation of boron nitride interfacial coatings fabricated by chemical vapor infiltration on SiC fibers under ambient air/room temperature conditions,"Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) interfacial coatings were deposited on SiC fibers by chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) and their degradation behavior under ambient air/room temperature conditions was studied with time. Degradation of the interfacial coatings with time was investigated by characterizing the morphology and microstructure of these materials with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Thermogravimetry coupled with differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyze the chemical reactions and phase transitions taking place in the BN coatings. The results showed that the as-deposited BN interfacial coatings fabricated by CVI were compact and well bonded to the SiC fibers. BN coatings remained relatively stable under ambient air/room temperature conditions for 50 h, while severe degradation was observed after 500 h of exposure. The degradation of BN interfacial coatings was mainly caused by two factors, namely, reaction with atmospheric air to produce boric oxide and amorphization of the hexagonal structure. The degradation observed under ambient air/room temperature might be due to incomplete crystallinity of BN interfacial coatings. Presence of water vapor may accelerate degradation of the coatings. The results of this degradation test can be used as a reference for the storage of BN coatings fabricated by CVI.","Dai, Jianwei;Wang, Yiguang;Xu, Zhenhua;He, Limin",2019-04-15,Ceramics International,"Hexagonal boron nitride,SiC fibers,Chemical vapor infiltration,Degradation behavior",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.191,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.191
Thermal behaviour of vitreous ceramic coatings obtained by electrophoretic deposition for furnace components,"In this study, three different vitreous ceramic coatings have been designed to improve radiation heat transfer and thereby increase the thermal efficiency of fired heaters or furnaces working at high temperatures. The vitreous ceramic coatings were produced through Electrophoretic Deposition technique (EPD) of ceramic suspensions. These ceramic formulations were designed based on components which increase emissivity, such as SiO2 and a Black dye (based on chromium, copper and iron oxides), added in 25 wt%. These coatings showed emissivity values around 0.89 at room temperature and around 0.82 at 550 °C in the middle infrared (MIR) spectral range, with slight differences between them. The SiO2 and Black dye additions provide an important protective effect on the coatings’ thermal stability as it was proved by the absorbance level at long times, higher than 85% in the near infrared (NIR) spectral range. These results were also supported by microstructural characterisation, substrate-coatings adhesion strength and thermal stability tests.","Pérez, Rosalina;Querejeta, Amaia;Corres, M.

"Phase stability, thermo-physical properties and thermal cycling behavior of plasma-sprayed CTZ, CTZ/YSZ thermal barrier coatings","ZrO2 co-stabilized by CeO2 and TiO2 with stable, nontransformable tetragonal phase has attracted much attention as a potential material for thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) applied at temperatures > 1200 °C. In this study, ZrO2 co-stabilized by 15 mol% CeO2 and 5 mol% TiO2 (CTZ) and CTZ/YSZ (zirconia stabilized by 7.4 wt% Y2O3) double-ceramic-layer TBCs were respectively deposited by atmospheric plasma spraying. The microstructures, phase stability and thermo-physical properties of the CTZ coating were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric-differential scanning calorimeter (TG-DSC), laser pulses and dilatometry. Results showed that the CTZ coating with single tetragonal phase was more stable than the YSZ coating during isothermal heat-treatment at 1300 °C. The CTZ coating had a lower thermal conductivity than that of YSZ coating, decreasing from 0.89 W m−1 K−1 to 0.76 W m−1 K−1 with increasing temperature from room temperature to 1000 °C. The thermal expansion coefficients were in the range of 8.98 × 10−6 K−1 – 9.88 ×10−6 K−1. Samples were also thermally cycled at 1000 °C and 1100 °C. Failure of the TBCs was mainly a result of the thermal expansion mismatch between CTZ coating and superallloy substrate, the severe coating sintering and the reduction-oxidation of cerium oxide. The thermal durability of the TBCs at 1000 °C can be effectively enhanced by using a YSZ buffer layer, while the thermal cycling life of CTZ/YSZ double-ceramic-layer TBCs at 1100 °C was still unsatisfying. The thermal shock resistance of the CTZ coating should be improved; otherwise the promising properties of CTZ could not be transferred to a well-functioning coating.","Wang, Jinshuang;Sun, Junbin;Yuan, Jieyan;Jing, Qiangshan;Dong, Shujuan;Liu, Bing;Zhang, Hao;Deng, Longhui;Jiang, Jianing;Zhou, Xin;Cao, Xueqiang",2018-06-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,Phase stability,Thermo-physical properties,Thermal cycling",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.149,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.149
2D Sn-doped ZnO ultrathin nanosheet networks for enhanced acetone gas sensing application,"In this paper, we report the synthesis, characterizations and gas sensing application of 2D Sn-doped ZnO ultrathin nanosheet networks synthesized by a simple and facile hydrothermal process. The synthesized nanosheets were characterized using several techniques in terms of their morphological, structural, optical and compositional properties. The detailed characterizations confirmed that the nanosheets are pure, grown in high-density, possessing well-crystalline wurtzite hexagonal phase and exhibiting good optical properties. Further, the synthesized nanosheets were used as functional material to develop nanosensor device by coating it on the alumina substrate with suitable electrodes. The fabricated sensor device was tested towards acetone gas which exhibited a maximum sensitivity of 5.556 (Ra/Rg) for 200ppm of acetone at 320°C.","Al-Hadeethi, Yas;Umar, Ahmad;Al-Heniti, Saleh.

Microstructure and oxidation behavior of Si–MoSi2 functionally graded coating on Mo substrate,"The Si–MoSi2 functionally graded coating on Mo substrate consisting of a Si–MoSi2 layer (2.5µm), a MoSi2 layer (18µm) and a Mo–Mo5Si3–Mo3Si layer (2–4µm) was prepared by a liquid phase siliconizing method. The siliconized coating has a dense layered structure and no micro-cracks and holes. The Si element mainly enriches on the surface with the highest content of about 50wt%, and inhibits the formation of Mo5Si3 and volatile MoO3 and improves the high-temperature oxidation resistance of the coating. The mass gain of Si-MoSi2 coating is only 0.17wt% after oxidized at 1600℃ for 70h. The Si–MoSi2 functionally graded coating exhibits better high temperature oxidation resistance than pure MoSi2 coating.","Zhang, Yingyi;Li, Yungang;Bai, Chenguang",2017-06-01,Ceramics International,"Molybdenum,MoSi2,Siliconizing,Oxidation,Functionally graded coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.02.024,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.02.024
Substrate effect on wear resistant transition metal nitride hard coatings: Microstructure and tribo-mechanical properties,"Four types of different hard transition metal nitrides (TMN:ZrN, CrN, WN and TiN) coatings were deposited on Si (100) and 316LN stainless steel substrates using DC magnetron sputtering. A comprehensive study of microstructure and substrate dependent tribo-mechanical properties of TMN coatings was carried out. Higher hardness (H) and elastic modulus (E) were obtained for WN (H=40GPa and E=440GPa) and TiN (H=30GPa and E=399GPa) coatings. This is related to the formation of (100) and (111) preferred orientations in WN and TiN coatings, respectively. However, the less hardness and elastic modulus were obtained for ZrN and CrN coatings where (200) orientation is preferred. Remarkably, low friction coefficient (0.06–0.57) and higher wear resistance in the coatings deposited on steel substrates are directly associated with the higher resistance to plastic deformation (H 3 /E 2) and the presence of intrinsic compressive stress. Three body wear modes enhanced the friction coefficient (0.15–0.62) and the wear rate in the coatings deposited on Si substrates. This is primarily associated with low fracture toughness of brittle single crystalline Si (100) substrates. Steel-on-steel contact was dominated in ZrN/steel sliding system. This occurs due to the severe adhesive wear mode of steel ball, whereas, the abrasive wear modes were attained for the CrN, WN and TiN coatings sliding against steel balls.","Dinesh Kumar, D.;Kumar, N.;Kalaiselvam, S.;Dash, S.;Jayavel, R.",2015-09-30,Ceramics International,"C.

Hot corrosion behavior of plasma sprayed 8YSZ-alumina- CNT composite coating in Na2SO4–60% V2O5 molten salt environment,"Hot corrosion (HC) behavior of air plasma sprayed 8% yttria stabilized zirconia (8YSZ) -alumina (YA) composite thermal barrier coating has been evaluated in the present work. Three variants of YA coatings were produced, two by reinforcing 1%, 3% multiwall carbon nanotube (MCNT) and one coating was obtained without any MCNT reinforcement. The creep strength enhanced ferritic P91 steel was used as substrate material for coating. Na2SO4 and V2O5 salts mixed in 2:3 ratio was applied to the coating and subjected to 800 °C for 120 h in an electric furnace. The microstructure and phase characterization of the coating was carried out before and after HC using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) respectively. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) integrated with the SEM was used for elemental analysis of the coating. The investigation reveals improved isothermal HC behavior of 1% MCNT reinforced coating. The dominating effect of the HC was recognized as depletion of yttria leading to destabilization of 8YSZ. The formation of YVO4 was the corrosion product containing the depleted Y2O3 of YSZ. The 1% and 3% MCNT reinforced coating exhibited monoclinic phase percentage of around 9% and 34% respectively. Nanoindentation was carried out along the cross-section before and after the isothermal HC. The Youngs modulus after HC increased by 46%, 42%, 12.5% and 38% for 8Y, 8YA, 8YA1C and 8YA3C coating, respectively. Weibull modulus of Youngs modulus of bond coats was used to identify the efficiency of top coat in retarding the infiltration of molten salt. The bond coat of 8YA1C coating exhibited lowest modulus value (m = 8.55) indicated non-uniform infiltration of detrimental species. The 1% MCNT reinforced thermal barrier coating (TBC) system was more resistant to degradation than the conventional 8YSZ and YA composite coatings.","Thakare, J.G.;Mulik, R.S.;Mahapatra, M.M.;upadhyaya, Rohit",2018-12-01,Ceramics International,"MCNT,YSZ,Composite,Hot corrosion,TBC",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.217,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.217
SiC/YSiC composite coating on matrix graphite sphere prepared by pack cementation and molten salt,"SiC/YSiC composite coating was prepared on the surface of matrix graphite sphere by pack cementation and molten salt process to improve the anti-oxidation property of the matrix graphite. According to the experiment results, the composition of the composite coatings prepared with different Y content is the same. While, the crushing model and strength is different. The maximum crushing strength is 1716.2 N when Y content is 1 g. The different coating structure were analyzed according to the results. The coating is composed of inner original SiC layer and outer new formed Si layer when Y content is 0.25 g. When the addition of Y were 0.5 g and 0.75 g, the coating consists of a newly formed YC2 layer inside, a SiC layer in the middle and an external Si layer.

Hydroxyapatite-based nanoparticles as a coating material for the dentine surface: An antibacterial and toxicological effect,"In this study, nano sized hydroxyapatite (nHAp) and Ag(I) doped hydroxyapatite (Ag-nHAp) particles were synthesized by the precipitation method and used as a coating material for remineralization on caries-affected dentine samples. Characterization studies of both the synthesized hydroxyapatite-based particles and the coated dentine samples were performed using instrumental techniques such as SEM and FTIR, and then toxicity and antibacterial properties were also evaluated. It was observed that dentine samples were effectively coated by both nHAp and Ag-nHAp particles which have no toxic effects. Furthermore, the coating of nano-hydroxyapatite on dentine samples positively contributed to the viability of L929 fibroblast cells and also provided an antibacterial effect against to bacteria such as S. mutants, C. albicans and E. coli bacteria that are most frequently caused caries in the teeth. While all type of bacteria was eliminated by the nHAp coated dentine samples at 24th, Ag-nHAp coated dentine samples removed to all bacteria type at 1st.","Erdem, Umit;Dogan, Mustafa;Metin, Aysegul U.;Baglar, Serdar;Turkoz, Mustafa B.;Turk, Mustafa;Nezir, Saffet",2020-01-31,Ceramics International,"Dentine coating,Nanoparticles,Hydroxyapatite,Silver,Antibacterial,Cytotoxicity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.260,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.260
Comparative study of three yttrium organometallic compounds for the stabilization of the cubic phase in YSZ deposited by PE-CVD,"In this work, the efficiencies of three organometallic yttrium precursors used to produce YSZ coatings by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition were studied. Yttrium (III) acetylacetonate, Y (acac)3, yttrium (III) hexafluoroacetylacetonate, Y (acacF6)3, and yttrium (III) tris(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionate), Y (tmhd)3, were used to stabilize the cubic phase in zirconia deposited at temperatures from 500 to 800 °C. Our results showed that at temperatures between 500 and 600 °C, Y (tmhd)3 appeared to be the most efficient dopant as it introduced the highest concentration of yttria (1–2.7 mol%) with only 6.4–5.6 at.% carbon. However, at 700 and 800 °C, Y (acac)3 introduced twice as much yttria (8–15 mol%) as Y (tmhd)3 with almost the same amount of carbon (5.4–3 at.%). Conversely, Y (acacF6)3 was the least efficient as it maintained a low concentration of yttria of around 0.7–1.8 mol% with 3.6–8.2 at.% carbon for all the deposition temperatures. Among these precursors, only Y (acac)3 surpassed 8 mol% yttria and achieved a fully stabilized cubic phase at 800 °C, with the remaining samples stabilizing only the tetragonal phase. The tetragonal phase was stabilized due to the formation of crystallites of around 10 nm. The observed difference in the efficiency of the three precursors was correlated to important differences in their decomposition behavior as observed by mass spectrometry and thermogravimetry/differential scanning calorimetry.","Espinoza-Pérez, L.J.;López-Honorato, Eddie;González, Luis A.;García-Montalvo, Verónica",2020-10-10,Ceramics International,"Yttrium organometallic compounds,Zirconia,YSZ,PE-CVD,Cubic phase,Thermal behavior",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.028,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.028
Modeling the thermal radiation properties of thermal barrier coatings based on a random generation algorithm,"Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are porous media in which many different pores and cracks are induced by different manufacturing procedures. Many studies have been conducted to investigate the impact of microstructures of TBCs on thermal conductivity; nevertheless, the influence of microstructures on the radiative properties of TBCs has not drawn significant attention. In addition, the working condition of thermal barrier coatings is at high temperatures at which the contribution of radiative heat transfer plays a very crucial role. Therefore, it is necessary to study the radiative properties of TBCs to characterize their insulation performance. In this work, the microstructures of air-plasma- sprayed (APS) 8wt% yttria stabilized zirconia (8YSZ) thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are constructed by the quartet structure generation set (QSGS) algorithm. A finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) method is carried out to simulate radiative heat transfer through TBCs. Three parameters—average pore size, directional growth probability D i (especially horizontal growth probability D 13 ) and porosity—have been investigated to study the microstructural effect on the radiative properties of TBCs. The reflectance of freestanding 50-μm-thick thermal barrier coatings is studied using Lumerical FDTD Solutions in the wavelength range from 1 to 6μm at normal incidence. The absorption and scattering coefficient as a function of wavelength are extracted using the four-flux model. The results will help us to characterize the radiative heat transfer process across the TBCs and provide us with a theoretical guide to design TBCs with a high thermal insulation property.","Shi, H.;Zhao, C.Y.;Wang, B.X.",2016-06-30,Ceramics International,"Plasma sprayed YSZ coatings,Quartet structure generation set,Radiative properties,Microstructure,Optimization",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.03.067,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.03.067
Enhancement of the microwave absorption properties of PyC-SiCf/SiC composites by electrophoretic deposition of SiC nanowires on SiC fibers,"The employment of coating technique on the silicon carbide fibers plays a pivotal role in preparing SiC fiber-reinforced SiC composites (SiCf/SiC) toward electromagnetic wave absorption applications. In this work, SiC nanowires (SiCNWs) are successfully deposited onto the pyrolytic carbon (PyC) coated SiC fibers by an electrophoretic deposition method, and subsequently densified by chemical vapor infiltration to obtain SiCNWs/PyC-SiCf/SiC composites. The results reveal that the introduction of SiCNWs could markedly enhance the microwave absorption properties of PyC-SiCf/SiC composites. Owing to the increasing of SiCNWs loading, the minimum reflection loss of composites raises up to −58.5 dB in the SiCNWs/PyC-SiCf/SiC composites with an effective absorption bandwidth (reflection loss ≤ −10 dB) of 6.13 GHz. The remarkable enhancement of electromagnetic wave absorption performances is mainly attributed to the improved dielectric loss ability, impedance matching and multiple reflections. This work provides a novel strategy in preparing SiCf/SiC composites with excellent electromagnetic wave absorption properties.","Huang, Ben;Wang, Zhengqin;Hu, Hailong;Xiu-ZhiTang,;Huang, Xiaozhong;Yue, Jianling;Wang, Yi",2020-05-31,Ceramics International,"Silicon carbide fiber/silicon carbide composites,Silicon carbide/pyrolytic carbon coating,Microwave absorption,Electrophoretic deposition,SiC nanowires",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.185,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.185
Influence of annealing temperature on the structural and optical properties of Mg–Al co-doped ZnO thin films prepared via sol–gel method,"Mg–Al co-doped ZnO (AMZO) thin films were deposited on quartz glass via sol–gel spin coating method. The structural and optical properties of Mg–Al co-doped ZnO thin films annealed at different temperatures were characterized via X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectra (EDS), ultraviolet–visible–near-infrared spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. XRD results revealed that the films had a hexagonal wurtzite structure, and the calculated average grain size increased from 23.02nm to 49.85nm when the annealing temperature was increased from 500°C to 800°C. The change in lattice parameters was demonstrated by grain size, strain, and residual stress. The SEM images showed that the AMZO thin film surface appeared flat, and the grain size was uniformly distributed at 500°C. When the annealing temperature was increased from 600°C to 800°C, the surface of the films showed larger grain sizes, numerous micropores, and some cracks. The EDS results confirmed the presence of Mg and Al elements in the AMZO thin films. Raman spectroscopy results showed that all films had E2 (high) mode, which indicates that all films had a ZnO wurtzite structure. Moreover, the optical transmittance of the AMZO thin films was over 85% in the visible region. The optical band gap of the AMZO thin films decreased from 3.348eV to 3.304eV when the annealing temperature was increased from 500°C to 800°C. The room temperature photoluminescence spectra showed an ultraviolet (UV) emission peak and a strong defect emission peak. The UV peaks of the AMZO thin films were red-shifted from 372nm to 379nm. In addition, the defect peaks of the AMZO thin films were blue-shifted from 598nm to 527nm when the annealing temperature was increased from 500°C to 800°C. The possible mechanisms of the defect peaks were studied.","Fang, Dongyu;Yao, Pei;Li, Huijun",2014-05-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Influence of powder size on characteristics of air plasma sprayed silicon coatings,"Silicon powders with different medium sizes (114μm, 79μm and 31μm, respectively) were used to fabricate coatings by air plasma spraying. The velocity and temperature of in-flight silicon particles during plasma spraying were determined. The composition and microstructure of the coatings were characterized and some physical properties of the coatings were measured. The obtained results showed that the size of silicon particles had great influence on their velocity and temperature in plasma flame. The oxidation of silicon particles in the spraying process was observed and is higher for particles of smaller sizes. Areas of silicon oxide in micrometer size are embedded and randomly distributed in the coating. The surface roughness and void content of silicon coatings increase with an increase in the particle size of the powders. The microhardness and oxygen content of coatings decrease with an increase in the particle size. However, the size of silicon particles has little impact on the deposition efficiency of silicon under the same deposition conditions.","Niu, Yaran;Zheng, Xuebin;Liu, Xuanyong;Ji, Heng;Ding, Chuanxian",2012-09-30,Ceramics International,"Plasma spraying,Silicon coatings,Particle characteristics,Oxidation,Microstructure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.03.080,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.03.080
Fabrication and mechanical properties of metal matrix composite with homogeneously dispersed ceramic particles,"Titanium carbide (TiC) particles were coated with nickel (Ni) to increase their compatibility with a metal matrix, leading to an improvement in the dispersibility of TiC particles in the molten matrix. TiC particles were dispersed into a basic aqueous solution of pH 12, and then nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2), as a Ni precursor, was added to the TiC suspension. The interaction between the TiC particles and the Ni precursor is driven by the attractive force between the Ni cations and the TiC particles with negative charge. An inoculant (ferrosilicon), which has been used in the foundry industry to improve crystal growth of graphite, was used as a core particle. The Ni-treated TiC particles were coated onto the surface of the inoculant using an inorganic binder converted into its glass phase by sol–gel reactions. The reinforcement particles prepared through the dual-coating process were then injected into the molten matrix based on iron at 1500°C. The crystal phase of the graphite is more finely and shortly grown in the reinforced metal matrix than in that without the reinforcement particles. This means that the reinforcement particles are homogeneously and uniformly dispersed into the matrix without any aggregation of particles, implying that the mechanical properties of the reinforced matrix would be greater than those of a non-reinforced matrix. Consequently, metal matrix composites with reasonable properties can be fabricated successfully using the reinforcement particles prepared by the dual-coating process.","Kim, Eun-Hee;Cho, Geun-Ho;Lee, Je-Hyun;Jung, Yeon-Gil;Yoo, YoungSoo;Seo, SeongMoon",2013-08-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Atmospheric plasma sprayed 7%-YSZ thick thermal barrier coatings with controlled segmentation crack densities and its thermal cycling behavior,"Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)-coatings are deposited on Ni-based superalloy IN738 by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS). For the first time, controlled segmentation crack densities are manually developed in the coatings, even after the APS deposition. This method allows to user to control segmentation densities as well as cracks depth, which could be designed as per coating thickness and required application. Thermal cycling test shows promising strain tolerance behavior for the segmented coatings, whereas coating without segmentation could not sustain even for its first thermal cycle period. Further, microstructural studies reveal that a very thin layer of TGO was formed and obvious no coating failure or spallation was observed after thermal cycling test at 1150°C for 500 cycles.","Tailor, Satish;Upadhyaya, Rohit;S.Y., Manjunath;Dub, A.V.;Modi, Ankur;Modi, S.C.",2018-02-15,Ceramics International,"Atmospheric plasma spraying (APS),TBCs,YSZ,Segmentation density, thermal cycling test",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.219,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.219
Anti-ablation performance of La2O3-modified ZrB2 coating on SiC-coated carbon/carbon composites,"La2O3-modified ZrB2 coating was prepared on SiC-coated C/C composites by supersonic atmospheric plasma spraying (SAPS) with the aim of improving the anti-ablation performance of C/C composites. The effect of La2O3 contents on the anti-ablation performance were investigated. The results indicated that the 10 vol % La2O3–ZrB2 coating shows excellent anti-ablation performance. After ablation for 120 s under low heat flux oxyacetylene flame (2400 kW/m2), the linear ablation rate and mass ablation are only −0.0167 μm/s and −0.558 mg/s, respectively. After ablation for 30 s under high heat flux of oxyacetylene flame (4200 kW/m2), the coating still remains intact. The addition of 10 vol % La2O3 is capable of enhancing the anti-ablation performance of the ZrB2 coating. The La2O3 and La2Zr2O7 phases will be soften and melting during ablation, which can form a barrier to cover the surface and effectively prevent the erosion of oxyacetylene gas. Meanwhile, the generated ZrO2 particles play the role of pinning the molten layer, thus weakening the coating exfoliation by airflow erosion.","Chen, Miaomiao;Yao, Xiyuan;Feng, Guanghui;Guo, Yao",2020-12-15,Ceramics International,"C/C composites,Anti-ablation performance,ZrB2 coating,La2O3",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.038,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.038
Evolution of mechanical properties of thermal barrier coatings subjected to thermal exposure by instrumented indentation testing,"The evolution of mechanical properties, namely Young's modulus, hardness, fracture toughness and residual stresses of air plasma-sprayed 8wt% Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) subjected to thermal exposure at 1100°C, was evaluated based on an instrumented indentation testing system. It is found that the variation of Young's modulus and hardness with the increase of thermal exposure time can be divided into two regimes: a rapid initial increase, followed by a more gradual increase. Conversely, fracture toughness decreased from the initial value of 1.48–1.05MPam1/2 after 350h, indicating the degradation of TBCs. And the corresponding residual stress in top coat varied from the deposition stress of −29.9MPa to a maximum of −56.0MPa within 100h, and then decreased to −15.0MPa after 350h. The evolution of mechanical properties was correlated with microstructural changes in the top coat. Microstructure observations revealed that thermally grown oxide (TGO) formed at the interface between ceramic coat and bond coat, and was predominantly comprised of Al2O3 layer, along with some oxide clusters of (Cr, Al)2O3, (Co, Ni)(Cr, Al)2O4 and NiO. The growth of TGO followed a parabolic law with a rate constant of 0.13236μm2/h. After 350h, porosity in 8YSZ coatings was reduced from 8.39% to 5.79% as a result of activated diffusion-controlled sintering.","Li, C.C.;Wang, T.;Liu, X.J.;Zheng, Z.H.;Li, Q.",2016-06-30,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Instrumented indentation testing,Young's modulus,Fracture toughness,Residual stress",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.03.149,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.03.149
Effect of various additives on morphology and corrosion behavior of ceramic coatings developed on AZ31 magnesium alloy by plasma electrolytic oxidation,"Plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) coatings were developed on AZ31 magnesium alloy using alkaline silicate with KOH as a base electrolyte system, and with the addition of sodium aluminate, sodium tetra borate, potassium titanium fluoride, tri sodium ortho phosphate and urea as additives. The phase composition and surface morphology of these multi-phase coatings were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The corrosion behavior of the coated samples was evaluated by potentiodynamic polarization tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 3.5wt.% NaCl solution. The results showed that the anions namely, SiO3 2−, AlO2 −, B4O7 2−, F− and PO4 3−, effectively participated in the coating formation influencing its chemical composition and surface morphology and thereby corrosion resistance. The mechanism of corrosion process of each coating was explained in detail with the help of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) analysis and equivalent circuit modeling. It was observed that the sample treated by PEO in the electrolyte solution containing sodium tetra borate as an additive showed higher corrosion resistance which could be attributed to its morphological characteristics.","Sreekanth, D.;Rameshbabu, N.;Venkateswarlu, K.",2012-08-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Mechanical behavior of anti-oxidation coatings on C/C composites at elevated temperature: An in-situ indentation study,"Mechanical behavior of anti-oxidation coatings at high temperatures has an important influence on service safety of C/C composites. In this study, an in-situ high temperature indentation method was firstly adopted to study mechanical behavior of Hf-based anti-oxidation coatings in air up to 1000 °C. The indentation tests at room temperature, 800 and 1000 °C were conducted on the surface of the coatings. The maximum indentation depth and modulus increased and decreased with increasing temperature, respectively. And they both changed at a slower rate ranging from room temperature to 800 °C and a faster rate ranging from 800 to 1000 °C. It is also found that a smooth thin glass layer was formed on the surface of the coatings and had little influence on the mechanical behavior of the coatings at 800 °C. However, the oxidation became severe and some voids came into being at 1000 °C. The mechanical behavior was seriously affected, and the plasticity was obviously enhanced, resulting in a significant reduction in the modulus of the coatings.","Qu, Zhaoliang;Kai, Wei;Dong, Tong;Xi, Li;Li, Ying;He, Rujie;Fang, Daining",2020-04-01,Ceramics International,"Anti-oxidation coatings,High temperature,Mechanical behavior,In-situ indentation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.150,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.150
Ablation behavior of ZrC-La2O3 coating for SiC-coated carbon/carbon composites under an oxyacetylene torch,"To improve the ablation resistance of carbon/carbon (C/C) composites, ZrC-La2O3 coating was prepared on SiC-coated C/C composites by supersonic atmosphere plasma spraying. Ablation resistance of the coating was evaluated under an oxyacetylene torch with a heat flux of 4.2MW/m2. The coating shows a significant improvement on the ablation resistance compared with monophase ZrC coating and ZrC coating with LaB6. The good ablation resistance of the coating is mainly attributed to the formation of dense and high-viscosity scale surface which is beneficial to reducing the infiltration of oxygen and resisting the scouring from the flame during ablation. The positive effect of La2O3 is to improve the compactness of the scale surface during ablation.","Jia, Yujun;Li, Hejun;Fu, Qiangang;Sun, Jiajia;Li, Lu",2016-09-30,Ceramics International,"Carbon/carbon composites,Coating,Ablation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.045,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.045
Effect of nickel coating on the mechanical behaviour of polymer replicated Al2O3 foams,"The present investigation explores the effect of Nickel coating on Alumina (Al2O3) foams under quasistatic and dynamic conditions. Initially Al2O3 foams with 10, 20 and 30 Pores Per Linear Inch (PPI) were prepared by polymeric sponge replication technique and subsequently foams were coated with nickel (Ni) by electrolytic process. Ni coating resulted in substantial enhancement of compressive strength under static condition for all foams irrespective of their pore density. An increase of 19 times was noticed for 10 PPI foam and a range of 14–15 times of enhancement was observed with 20 and 30 PPI foams. Plateau stress (σ pl ), energy absorption density (EAD), densification strain (εcd), and energy absorption efficiency (EAE) were estimated and evaluated on a comparison basis. Under the dynamic impact, maximum energy absorption property was found to be 9 times that of bare foams. Introduction of metallic coating on cellular ceramics structures leading to enhancement of compressive strength and energy absorption properties will be useful for various applications.","Vemoori, Raju;Bogu, V.

Microstructure and properties of high velocity oxygen fuel sprayed (WC-Co)-Ni coatings,"The (WC-Co)-Ni composite coatings were fabricated by high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) spraying process using (WC-Co)-Ni powders prepared through blending agglomerated WC-Co powder with Ni powder. Microstructure and phase composition of the coatings deposited with different content of Ni powders were characterized using scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. The microhardness, elastic modulus and fracture toughness of the coatings were tested by indentation method. The wear properties of the coatings sliding in dry and wet conditions as well as under different applied loads were tested using a modified pin-on-disc tester. Experimental results showed that the microstructure of HVOF sprayed (WC-Co)-Ni composite coating was exhibited some lamella features consisted of deformed WC-Co splats and even distributed Ni splats, which was significantly influenced by the Ni content in original powders. Phase constitutions of the coatings mainly consisted of WC, W2C, Co, Ni and a little of Co6W6C, which were related to the Ni content in original powders.

Oxidation protection of graphite materials by single-phase ultra-high temperature boride modified monolayer Si-SiC coating,"To improve the oxidation resistance of Si-SiC coating, single-phase ultra-high temperature boride (ZrB2 or TaB2) modified Si-SiC coating was designed and established on graphite substrates by combination of dipping and reactive infiltration process. ZrB2 or TaB2 phase was introduced in Si-SiC coating by directly mixing raw materials and phenol formaldehyde resin in the slurry, and then the ZrB2-SiC-Si and TaB2-SiC-Si coatings were fabricated on the graphite samples by dipping-curing, pyrolysis, and siliconizing. The crystalline phases and microstructure of the as-obtained multiphase coatings were investigated by X-ray diffraction analysis and scanning electron microscopy. The interrupted oxidation tests from room-temperature to 1500 °C were conducted to assess the anti-oxidation property of the prepared coatings. After 1200 h of oxidation at 1500 °C in air (30 times thermal cycles), the mass losses of the graphite substrates coated with ZrB2-SiC-Si and TaB2-SiC-Si coatings were 0.086% and 0.537%, respectively, and the high-temperature stability of the modified coatings was greatly improved compared to the Si-SiC coating. The excellent anti-oxidation performances of the compound coatings were attributed to the compact structure of the coatings and the formation of compound oxide layers covering on the surfaces. The compound Zr-Si-O and Ta-Si-O films possessed low oxygen diffusion rate and appropriate viscosity, which can provide appreciable oxidation protection for the internal coatings, thus obtaining the excellent oxidation and spallation resistance property.","Jiang, Yan;Ren, Quanxing;Ru, Hongqiang;Mao, Zhiliang;Xu, Haibin",2019-01-31,Ceramics International,"ZrB2-SiC-Si coating,TaB2-SiC-Si coating,Interrupted oxidation,Oxidation resistance,Spallation resistance,Compound oxide layer",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.206,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.206

Superhydrophobic sand with multifunctionalities by TiO2-incorporated mussel-inspired polydopamine,"Sand as a kind of natural material exists abundantly in desert has not been effectively utilized because of its superhydrophilicity. In this study, the superhydrophobic sand particles were successfully fabricated by structuring mussel-inspired polydopamine and TiO2 coatings on sand surfaces and subsequent hydrophobic modification with low surface energy material. The water droplets stood on the superhydrophobic sand surfaces with an almost perfect sphere (water contact angle of ~153°), which broke the conventional concept towards the superhydrophilicity of sand. Furthermore, the obtained superhydrophobic sand particles had good water-holding capacity and high thermal stability, which contributed to the storage of water in desert. Meanwhile, the superhydrophobic sand exhibited a multifunctionality including oil/water separation, anti-icing properties and waterproof coating on fiberboards, which widened the application fields of desert sand and provided fast access to sustainable development of environment and natural resource.","Liu, Shumin;Cai, Tailong;Shen, Xiaoyuan;Huang, Erzhuo;Wang, Zhe;Sun, Qingfeng",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Sand,Polydopamine,TiO2,Superhydrophobicity,Multifunctionality",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.108,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.108
Effects of tailored nitriding layers on comprehensive properties of duplex plasma-treated AlTiN coatings,"Duplex-treated AlTiN coatings were deposited by advanced plasma assisted arc (APA-Arc) technology on pre-plasma nitrided AISI-H13 steel substrates using different N2/H2 flow ratios. The microstructures and properties of the AlTiN coatings were comprehensively characterized and analyzed. The results show that the N2/H2 flow ratios can tailor the thickness of compound layer during plasma nitriding process and the bright nitriding layer without compound layer is achieved. The properties of duplex-treated AlTiN coatings are well improved compared with monolayer AlTiN coating. The adhesion of the AlTiN coating is well enhanced by duplex treatment process, and adhesion grade increases from HF3-4 for monolayer AlTiN coating to HF1 for composite coatings. Moreover, the composite coatings with various thickness compound layers show different load-bearing capacities, and the interfacial adhesion force of the composite coating without compound layer reaches 61 N. The hardness of AlTiN coating is also enhanced by duplex treatment with the highest hardness of 2935 HV0.05.

Corrosion kinetics of Al2O3+ZrO2·5CaO coatings applied on gray cast iron substrate,"A Corrosion test was carried out on plasma sprayed alumina plus calcia stabilized zirconia coatings applied on the Gray Cast Iron (GCI) substrates. The specimens were prepared by coating a bond coat comprising Fe38Ni10Al and a top coat of Al2O3+ZrO2·5CaO in 50:50 proportions on GCI substrates. The top coat thickness was varied as 100,200 and 300µm. In the test, specimens were exposed to the saline aqueous NaCl solution for a period of 24h. Weight loss of specimen was measured at the interval of 8h followed by Scanning Electronic Microscopic (SEM) and EDAX analysis. From the results obtained, it was found that the iron present in the bond coat of the sample was subjected to corrosion. It led the way to the formation of hydrated iron oxide (Fe2O3H2O) which is visible on the top coat of specimens.

"Production of Ba0.991Bi0.006TiO3@ZnO–B2O3–SiO2 ceramics with a high dielectric constant, a core–shell structure, and a fine-grained microstructure by means of a sol-precipitation method","A core–shell structure was proved by energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) in both Ba0.991Bi0.006TiO3@ZnO–B2O3–SiO2 (BBT@ZBSO) nanoparticles and ceramics. The effects of ZBSO additive on the phase composition, microstructure, sintering temperature and dielectric properties of the BBT ceramics were studied. An obvious perovskite phase of BBT was detected in all samples, and small amounts of Ba2TiSi2O8 and Ba4ZnTi11O27 were detected in the ceramics with excess ZBSO and the higher sintering temperature. The average grain size of the BBT ceramics was 383nm at a ZBSO content of 4wt%, which is close to that of the original BBT nanoparticles (320nm). The sintering temperature decreased from more than 1300°C to 1140°C. The relative density increased from 70% to 98%, the dielectric constant at the Curie temperature (T c) reached a maximum of 3600, and the dielectric loss reached a minimum of around 0.005 with a 5wt% ZBSO coating.

Microstructure and properties of Cf/SiC composites with thin SiCN layer as fiber-protecting coating,"Cf/SiC composites were prepared first by chemical vapor infiltration for formation of SiCN coating on the fiber surface, then by polymer infiltration and pyrolysis for SiC densification process. The effect of SiCN content on microstructure and mechanical properties of the composites was investigated. As the content of deposited SiCN increased, the density of the composites gradually increased. Simultaneously, the bending strength and proportional limit stress were also improved. When the preform density after SiCN deposition reached about 1.01g/cm3, the ultimate bending strength and proportional limit stress of the final densified composites were enhanced to 386MPa and 302MPa, respectively.

Mechanisms governing the thermal shock and tensile fracture of PS-PVD 7YSZ TBC,"Thermal barrier coating (TBC) system including NiCoCrAlYTa metallic bond coating and 7YSZ (7wt%Y2O3-ZrO2) ceramic top coating was deposited on nickel-based superalloy by plasma spray-physical vapor deposition (PS-PVD). Thermal shock property of 7YSZ TBC was characterized by water-quenching test at 1100℃ and its failure behaviors were investigated in detail. Besides, tensile test was performed for TBC sample and its cross-sectional fracture microstructure was studied as well. The results showed that after water-quenching test lots of pitting spallation took place in TBC surface, but no obvious microcracks were observed. Additionally, the tensile test indicated that fracture occurred in 7YSZ coating near the interface of ceramic-bond coating. After conduction of water-quenching and tensile testing, a lot of spherical particles and nano-sized agglomerated clusters were observed in the quasi-columnar structured 7YSZ coating.

Part I discussed the microscopic observation of cracks, ridges and interlayers within the resulting silica coatings, and provided limited insight into their respective mechanisms of formation. This report provides further explanation for the mechanisms of these processes, as evidenced by spectroscopic and nano-indentation analyses of the coatings. Specifically, the coatings were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Auger electron spectroscopy. These results are discussed along with those obtained in Part I to further assess the mechanisms of crack formation in the coatings, and it was found that coating shrinkage and tension most likely caused crack formation. It seems that the O-deficient interlayers were formed under a mild oxidation condition existed around the silica/SUS304 interface during ∼500°C annealing.

The present study focuses on the characterization of ceramic matrix composite coatings with in-situ reinforcements, developed through combination of laser triggered chemical reaction and subsequent laser treatment. A preplaced precursor mixture of TiO2, SiO2, hBN and graphite powders in stoichiometric proportions is used for the chemical reaction activated by a high power laser beam to produce coatings containing TiB2, TiN, SiC and hBN. Minor modifications in the constituents of the preplaced precursor mixture helped in developing coatings different in terms of the amount of hBN and SiC present in it. This compositional variation brought significant changes in mechanical and tribological properties of the coatings. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) are used to confirm the presence of all the reaction products in the CMC coatings developed. Evaluation of nanomechanical properties and studies on the tribological properties of these coatings are performed thoroughly. Reduced modulus (Er) and nanohardness (H) of the composite coatings deposited on AISI 1025 steel have been measured from load–displacement curves. The stress-strain curves of composite coatings help in characterizing its damage tolerance and determining design stresses to find suitability to any application. Presence of hBN in composite coating causes reduction in coefficient of friction. Coatings formed with SiC in precursor helps in improving the specific wear rate. Top surface morphology and tribological properties of these coatings, after they are exposed to high temperature, are also explored.","Misra, Debjit;Dhakar, Balmukund;Anusha, E.;Shariff, S.M.;Mukhopadhyay, Suman;Chatterjee, Satyajit",2018-10-01,Ceramics International,"Laser alloying,Ceramic matrix composite,Nanoindentation,Specific wear rate,Hardness,Heat treatment",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.149,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.149
Highly stable- silica encapsulating magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4/SiO2) synthesized using single surfactantless- polyol process,"We developed a new one-pot synthesis method for silica coated magnetite nanoparticles by way of a cheap- modified polyol process. In this reaction, polyethylene glycol was used as a solvent media and it has been found to play a key role to act as a reducing agent, stabilizer as well as a linker for silica coating, simultaneously. The Fe3O4/SiO2 sample prepared by this new method was compared with other seed Fe3O4 and Fe3O4/SiO2 samples synthesized through the modified Stober method and characterized using different analysis techniques such as transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The magnetic properties of the seed Fe3O4 and silica coated magnetite nanoparticles were studied by vibrating sample magnetometer at room temperature. The produced composite sample showed excellent stability against oxidation when annealed at 600°C in presence of hydrogen gas. Thus, the facile new polyol process adopted in our study appears to be a promising route for synthesis of highly stable, hydrophilic silica coated magnetite nanoparticles.","Abbas, Mohamed;Parvatheeswara Rao, B.;Nazrul Islam, Md.;Naga, S.M.;Takahashi, Migaku;Kim, CheolGi",2014-01-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Effects of erbium content on the morphological and photoluminescent properties of sol-gel prepared yttrium oxide film,"This work presents the effects of erbium content on the morphological, structural, and photoluminescent properties of erbium-doped yttrium oxide film prepared by water-added-free gelation and spin coating. Crack-free annealed films with uniform thickness and good adhesion are obtained by spin-coating the precursor solutions synthesized by the water-added-free reaction at a low gelation rate. The proposed process has the features of no crack formation after high-temperature annealing, high film thickness homogeneity, and compatibility with standard semiconductor processes. The morphological and structural properties of the prepared films are investigated systematically by optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The OM and SEM measurements show that the variation in film color and film morphology is related to the erbium content. A decrease in the surface roughness with increasing erbium content is exhibited by the AFM measurement. The XRD results indicate that the preferential crystalline plane gradually varies from (400) to (222) as the erbium content increases. The peak PL wavelengths in the visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) ranges appear at the wavelengths of 561.2nm and 1536.6nm when the films are excited by pump lasers at the wavelengths of 532nm and 970nm. Yttrium oxide film with an erbium content of 5mol% has the maximal PL intensity for both VIS and NIR ranges. This optimal erbium content results from a compromise between the increase in the number of active erbium ions and the non-radiative recombination due to the erbium ion-ion interaction.","Wang, Tzyy-Jiann;Hua, Fan-Xiang;Chang, Yu-Hsu;Peng, Guan-Lu;Chou, Mei-Hua;Hung, Wei-Kuen",2018-02-01,Ceramics International,"Yttria,Sol–gel,Thin films,Photoluminescence",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.132,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.132
Thick alumina dielectric films on aluminum through chemically bonded composite sol–gel,A new process for ∼200μm thick multilayer dielectric films on aluminum was developed via chemically bonded composite sol–gel. The sol–gel process used alumina and chemical bonding used phosphoric acid and aluminum phosphates.

Composition and morphology effects on catalase mimetic activity of potential bioactive glasses,"The catalase mimetic activity (CMA) of potential bioactive glasses based on Hench - 45S5 Bioglass® (46.1%SiO2-24.4%Na2O-26.9%CaO-2.6P2O5 mol%, called H), Kokubo bioactive glass (50%SiO2–25%Na2O–25%CaO mol%, called K) and mesoporous bioactive glass (80%SiO2–15%CaO–5%P2O5 mol%, called MBG) modified by the introduction of metal oxide (MO, M = Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zr and Ce) was tested in order to verify how their composition, morphology and synthesis procedure influence the ability to inhibit oxidative stress in terms of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a common reactive oxygen species (ROS). The characterization was achieved on the glasses before and after the soaking in H2O2 in order to obtain information about the kinetic order, the rate and the type of mechanism related to the decomposition H2O2 process. In fact, the H2O2 decomposition can follow a radical mechanism (with the formation of OH radical) or a peroxide-complex mechanism. Tests in SBF solutions were performed in order to verify the bioactivity in term of hydroxyapatite (HA) formation. The introduction of metal oxide into the glass composition promotes the CMA and the better catalytic activities were gained for the Co-, Mn-, Cu-, Ce- and Fe-containing glasses. All these glasses follow a 1st order kinetics but only in the case of Ce-containing glasses (H_4.0Ce) we observe a peroxide-complex mechanism. The Ce-containing glasses preserve their catalytic activity also coated with alginate and the reduction of glass powder dimension enhances the rate of H2O2 decomposition. Mesoporous glasses with a high specific surface area show a higher H2O2 decomposition rate with respect to that of melt-quenched derived glasses. The introduction of Ce, Cu, V, Ti, Zr and Fe do not modify the bioactivity in terms of HA formation during SBF tests (respect to H bioactive glass) and the alginate coating delay the HA formation without inhibiting its formation. H_5.3Co and H_5.3Mn showed the best catalytic performance (highest k value) but they seem not bioactive until 28 days of SBF soaking. By the data analysis obtained in this manuscript, we can affirm that the Ce-containing glasses are the most promising potential bioactive glasses with antioxidant properties.","Malavasi, Gianluca;Lusvardi, Gigliola",2020-11-30,Ceramics International,"Catalase mimetic activity,Bioactive glasses,Cerium,Radical mechanism,Peroxide-complex mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.067,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.067

Electroless nickel–phosphorus plating on silicon carbide particles for metal matrix composites,"In this work, a nickel–phosphorus (Ni–P) coating was deposited on the surface of silicon carbide (SiC) particles through electroless nickel (EN) deposition. The influences of main effective parameters, including NaH2PO2·H2O/NiSO4·6H2O molar ratio, dl-C4H6O5/NiSO4·6H2O molar ratio, pH and bath temperature, were investigated by the Taguchi design method. Subsequently, the optimized bath parameters for EN plating on SiC particles were further investigated by considering the balance between plating rate (R) and bath efficiency based on a series of experiments. The morphology and phase structure of the coating fabricated by the optimal bath were characterized. Thermal stability of the Ni–P coated SiC particles was also analyzed. The results showed that a more stable bath with relative maximum nickel R of 11.28% on the surface of SiC particles was obtained. As a result of this optimized bath, a continuous and uniform coating with an X-ray amorphous structure, around 1.2μm thickness, was fabricated on the SiC particles. Thermal analysis suggested that the EN coated SiC particles have a relative higher thermal stability than the original ones. Meanwhile, the coating formation mechanism for EN coating on SiC particles was discussed based on the morphologies in different deposition stages. Such EN plating can be successfully applied in the surface modification of ceramic particles, which favors the development of metal matrix composites.","He, Peng;Huang, Shangyu;Wang, Huachang;Huang, Zhichao;Hu, Jianhua;Cheng, Xudong;Pan, Chengang",2014-12-31,Ceramics International,"Electroless plating,Silicon carbide particles,Ni–P coating,Plating rate,Growth mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.08.027,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.08.027
A 2D finite element approach for predicting the machining performance of nanolayered TiAlCrN coating on WC-Co cutting tool during dry turning of AISI 1045 steel,"The hard coatings have proved very effective in industrial machining applications, and the development of new coatings relies more on simulations of the cutting process. In this regard, the present work investigates the machining performance of newly developed TiAlCrN multi-layered coating on tungsten carbide cutting tool during dry turning of AISI 1045 steel. A finite element model with damage evolution based on fracture energy was developed with the help of Abaqus/Explicit software. Later, the numerical results were validated by experimental measurements. The application of coating not only helped in the reduction of friction and tool temperatures at different cutting speeds but also affected the chip formation mechanism significantly. The secondary shear plane (SSP) was generated while machining with both uncoated and coated cutting tools. However, the SSP appeared only at higher cutting speeds in the case of the coated cutting tool. The proposed finite element model is able to predict the instability and formation of secondary serrated teeth with good accuracy.","Kumar, Ch Sateesh;Zeman, Pavel;Polcar, Tomas",2020-11-30,Ceramics International,"TiAlCrN coating,Finite element analysis,Serrated chip,AISI 1045 steel",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.294,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.294
Microstructure of new composite electrocatalyst and its anodic behavior for chlorine and oxygen evolution,"The first layer of active coating made from a rutile-structured solid solution of ruthenium and titanium dioxides having an average crystal grain size of 30nm was thermally deposited on an adequately prepared titanium metal substrate. Then, at a temperature of 500°C, the second layer was formed on the first layer from a mixture of amorphous particles of metallic platinum and rutile-structured iridium dioxide nanocrystals having an average crystal grain size of 26nm. Rutile phase nanocrystals are characterized by a high density of chaotically distributed dislocations and high internal microstrain values. The coatings exhibit a compact granular morphology without cracks on the surface. Their catalytic activity is similar to that of conventional DSAs for the anodic oxidation of chloride ions from both concentrated and dilute sodium chloride solutions. The anodic current efficiency both during chlorate formation and active chlorine production was several percentage points higher in electrolyzers containing these anodes than in those containing DSAs. The catalytic activity of anodes having these coatings is about 50mV lower than that of DSAs and about 350mV higher than that of lead/antimony alloy electrodes, for oxygen evolution from acid sulfate solutions (0.5moldm−3 H2SO4) characteristic of processes for the production of some metals. An accelerated corrosion test showed that the stability of the double-layer anodes is about twelve-fold higher than that of conventional DSAs.","Spasojević, M.;Ribić-Zelenović, L.;Spasojević, P.",2012-09-30,Ceramics International,"B.

Synthesis and electrochemical properties of LiVP2O7/C as novel cathode material for lithium ion batteries,"Monoclinic LiVP2O7/C was successfully synthesized by the sol–gel method using citric acid as both the carbon source and reducing agent. The structure and morphology of the sample were investigated. TEM image showed that the surface of sample was covered with a thin carbon layer. Charge–discharge testing revealed that the LiVP2O7/C sample with carbon content of 6.63wt% prepared at 800°C exhibited the best initial discharge capacity of 102.3 mAh·g−1, 96.2% of which was retained after 50 cycles.

"Synthesis of all equiatomic five-transition metals High Entropy Carbides of the IVB (Ti, Zr, Hf) and VB (V, Nb, Ta) groups by a low temperature route","The six possible equiatomic five-transition metal High Entropy Carbides (HECs) of the IVB (Ti, Zr, Hf) and VB (V, Nb, Ta) groups of the periodic table, i.e., TiZrHfVNbC5, TiZrHfVTaC5, TiZrHfNbTaC5, TiZrVNbTaC5, TiHfVNbTaC5 and ZrHfVNbTaC5, were successfully obtained via a powder metallurgy route at room temperature, specifically, by one-step diffusion mechanosynthesis starting from the elemental constituents (using graphite as the carbon source). Three of those HECs, TiZrHfVTaC5, TiZrVNbTaC5 and ZrHfVNbTaC5, were developed for the first time. Their development was possible without any subsequent thermal treatment, in contrast to the usual way (reactive sintering at 1800–2200 °C), and in a powder form, make them potential advanced raw ceramics for hard, refractory and oxidation resistance coatings or matrix phase composites.","Chicardi, E.;García-Garrido, C.;Hernández-Saz, J.;Gotor, F.J.",2020-09-30,Ceramics International,"High entropy alloy,High entropy carbide,Carbide,Ceramic,Mechanical milling,Mechanosynthesis",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.240,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.240
Thermal cycling behaviour of plasma sprayed lanthanum zirconate based coatings under concurrent infiltration by a molten glass concoction,"Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) used in gas-turbine engines afford higher operating temperatures, resulting in enhanced efficiencies and performance. However, during aero engine operation, environmentally ingested airborne particles, which includes mineral debris, sand dust and volcanic ashes get ingested by the turbine with the intake air. As engine temperatures increase, the finer debris tends to adhere to the coating surface and form calcium magnesium alumino-silicate (CMAS) melts that penetrate the open void spaces in the coating. Upon cooling at the end of an operation cycle, the melt freezes and the infiltrated volume of the coating becomes rigid and starts to spall by losing its ability to accommodate strains arising from the thermal expansion mismatch with the underlying metal. The state-of-the-art ZrO2-7-weight% Y2O3 (YSZ) coatings are susceptible to the aforementioned degradation. Rare-earth zirconates have generated substantial interest as novel thermal barrier coatings (TBC) based primarily on their intrinsically lower thermal conductivity and higher resistance to sintering than YSZ. In addition, the pyrochlore zirconates are stable as single phases at up to their melting point. La2Zr2O7 (LZ) is one among such candidates. Hence, the present study focusses on the comparison of cyclic molten CMAS infiltration behaviour of the base metal Inconel 738 (BM), the bond coat NiCrAlY (BC), the duplex YSZ, the LZ coating and a five layered coated specimen with LZ as top layer. Among those coatings mentioned above, the five layer coated specimen showed excellent CMAS infiltration resistance under thermal cycling conditions.","C.S., Ramachandran;V., Balasubramanian;P.V., Ananthapadmanabhan",2013-03-31,Ceramics International,"B.

Titania nanotube/nano-brushite composited bioactive coating with micro/nanotopography on titanium formed by anodic oxidation and hydrothermal treatment,"This work was to improve the bioactivity of biomedical titanium (Ti) through constructing a bioactive surface with micro/nano-topography on Ti. Firstly, Ti plates were sandblasted, acid etched and anodized (SBAO) to obtain the controlled micro/nano-topography. And then, heat treatment was used to change the amorphous phase of Ti oxide nanotubes to anatase on the SBAO sample. The SBAO sample and heat treated SBAO sample (SBAOT) both have super hydrophilicity mainly due to their micro/nano-topography. At last, nano-brushite was deposited on the SBAOT surface by hydrothermal treatment to further improve its bioactivity. The simulated body fluid incubation indicated that this novel coating with nano-brushite has more excellent bioactivity as compared to Ti, and SBAO and SBAOT.","Wei, Daqing;Feng, Wei;Du, Qing;Zhou, Rui;Li, Baoqiang;Wang, Yaming;Zhou, Yu;Jia, Dechang",2015-12-31,Ceramics International,"E.

Microstructural changes were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and phase analysis was conducted by XRD and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. In the case of forced air quenched specimens, no deterioration was observed in the top coats after 100 cycles while the top coats were damaged in the water quenched ones.

Fabrication of corrosion-resistant Al2O3–CeO2 composite coating on AA7075 via plasma electrolytic oxidation coupled with electrophoretic deposition,Al2O3–CeO2 composite coating was fabricated on AA7075 by combining plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) with electrophoretic deposition (EPD). CeO2 nanoparticles are electrophoretically incorporated into the plasma electrolytic oxidized Al2O3 coatings by the synergetic effect of PEO and EPD processes. The passivation behavior of Al2O3 and inhibiting nature of CeO2 have been studied by the electrochemical corrosion analysis in 3.5wt% NaCl solution and salt spray corrosion test (SSCT) in 5wt% NaCl as per ASTM standards.

Hot corrosion behavior of CoWSi/WSi2 coating exposed to Na2SO4+NaCl salt at 900°C,"In this study, the high temperature hot corrosion behavior of a CoWSi/WSi2 composite coating was investigated. Hot corrosion studies were performed on CoWSi/WSi2 coated nickel specimens after exposure to a molten Na2SO4+NaCl salt environment at 900°C under cyclic conditions. Thermogravimetric technique was used to establish the kinetics of corrosion. XRD and SEM/EDS techniques were used to analyze the corrosion products. The oxide scale formed on the coating surface was complex and the hot corrosion resistance of coating may be attributed to the formation of oxides and spinels of silicon, cobalt and tungsten. Also, NaCl accelerated the degeneration of the coating because of producing the volatile CoCl2 and thereby oxygen and sulfur could easily penetrate into the coatings and caused the formation of internal oxide and sulfide.","Mehrizi, M.

"Ta addition effects on the structure, mechanical and thermal properties of sputtered Hf-Ta-C film","Transition metal carbides (TMCs) hold great promise for protective coatings due to their excellent mechanical properties, however, developing hard yet tough TMC-based materials against harsh environment continues to be a great need but challenge, as high hardness is often obtained with toughness deterioration. Here, we focus on HfC film modification with Ta addition (10.2–26.8 at.%) using magnetron co-sputtering system, particularly, two types phase structures (cubic Hf(Ta)C single-phase solid solution and mixed phase Hf-Ta-C structure (HfC + TaC mixture), respectively) are prepared for comparison and explanation. Mechanical tests reveal that the Hf(Ta)C solid solution film exhibits the highest hardness (36 ± 0.51 GPa), which is far beyond pure HfC and TaC reference, and is nearly two times higher than the film with mixed phase of TaC and HfC. Simultaneously, excellent fracture toughness with high K f value at 3.6 MPa m1/2 can be achieved in such a solid solution film, on account of high hardness/elasticity modulus ratio. All films exhibit low friction coefficient at∼0.3 when C lubrication medium occurs, the lubrication behavior surpasses corresponding nitrides film. After high-temperature annealing at 800 °C, the Hf(Ta)C solid solution film is found to perform better in terms of thermal stability and oxidation resistance, while structural destruction and obvious oxidation occur in other reference films. We therefore give the potential advantage of solid solution structure (relative to mixed phase structure) in regulating high-performance TMC-based protective coatings, which is fundamental but very practical for other material systems.","Gu, Xinlei;Yang, Lina;Ma, Xiaorong;Dai, Xuan;Wang, Jia;Wen, Mao;Zhang, Kan",2019-08-15,Ceramics International,"Transition metal carbides,Mechanical properties,Tribological properties,Thermal properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.069,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.069
Effect of microstructure and mechanical properties on wear behavior of plasma-sprayed Cr2O3-YSZ-SiC coatings,"In this study, the microstructure and mechanical properties of the atmospheric plasma-sprayed Cr2O3 (C), Cr2O3-20YSZ (CZ), and Cr2O3-20YSZ-10SiC (CZS) coatings were evaluated and also compared with each other, so as to explain the coatings wear behavior. Microstructural evaluations included X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and porosity measurements. Mechanical tests including bonding strength, fracture toughness, and micro-hardness tests were used to advance our understanding of the correlation between the coatings properties and their wear behavior. The sliding wear test was conducted using a ball-on-disk configuration against an alumina counterpart at room temperature. Addition of multimodal YSZ and subsequent SiC reinforcements to the Cr2O3 matrix resulted in an increase in the fracture toughness and Vickers micro-hardness, respectively. It was found that the composite coatings had comparable coefficients of friction with pure Cr2O3 coatings. When compared with the C coating, the CZ and CZS composite coatings with higher fracture toughness exhibited superior wear resistance. Observation of the wear tracks of the coatings indicated that the lower wear rates of the CZ and CZS coatings were due to the higher plastic deformation of the detached materials. In fact, improvement in the wear resistance of the composite coatings was attributed to a phase transformation toughening mechanism associated with tetragonal zirconia which created more ductile tribofilms during the wear test participated in filling the pores of coatings.","Hashemi, S.M.;Parvin, N.;Valefi, Z.",2019-04-01,Ceramics International,"Ball-on-disk wear,Cr2O3-YSZ-SiC,Plasma spray coating,Ceramic matrix composite,Multimodal/nano,Mechanical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.226,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.226
Thermal-induced blister cracking behavior of annealed sandwich-structured TiN/CrAlN films,"Sandwich-structured TiN/CrAlN films were rationally designed using metallic Ti and Al-Cr alloy targets by RF-pulsed magnetron sputtering. After obtained films were annealed at diverse temperatures at atmospheric pressure for 1h, the hardness reveals an apparent decrease evolution from 29.2 to 15.7GPa and H/E* ratio declines below 0.1 with increasing annealing temperature. Meanwhile, the grain size gradually becomes larger from 16.3 to 130.0nm with increasing annealing temperature. Interestingly, it is observed that cracking behavior of sandwich-structured composite TiN/CrAlN films at elevated temperature is originated from the top of the blisters where main component is alumina on the surface, in virtue of intrinsically induced stress during oxidation, thermal expansion mismatch and phase transformation of the oxide layer. No cracks, nevertheless, are yielded in the film between any two blisters. Herein, these findings provide some beneficial references for preparing high quality films and coatings in high temperature service.","Chen, Xiao;Pang, Xiaolu;Meng, Jie;Yang, Huisheng",2018-04-15,Ceramics International,"TiN/CrAlN film,Annealing,Mechanical properties,Blister,Cracking",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.014
Effect of heat treating gel films on the formation of superhydrophobic boehmite flaky structures on austenitic stainless steel,"The effect of heat treating gel films at different temperatures on the formation of the boehmite flaky structures on AISI 316 type austenitic stainless steel is investigated. After heating at different temperatures, the reactivity of the gel films with boiling water to form boehmite flakes was different, which resulted in different morphologies and different contact angle values after coating with hydrolyzed (heptadecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrodecyl)trimethoxysilane (FAS). When the gel film was heat treated from 200 to 600°C, the resulting contact angle was above 150°, indicating superhydrophobic behavior. However, when the gel film was heat treated below 200°C as well as at 700 and 800°C, only some boehmite flakes were formed; when the gel film was heat treated at 900°C, no boehmite flakes were observed. In these cases the surface roughness is insufficient for the superhydrophobicity. The formation condition of the boehmite flakes by reaction of the gel film with boiling water is also tentatively discussed.","Zhang, Xiaoxue;Honkanen, Mari;Pore, Viljami;Levänen, Erkki;Mäntylä, Tapio",2009-05-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Fabrication of porous Cu supported Ni-P/CeO2 composite coatings for enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline solution,"Cost-effective electrodes with high activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and durability are required to develop clean and renewable hydrogen energy. In this work, a porous Cu supported Ni-P/CeO2 composite coating was fabricated by a facile electrodeposition technique. Owing to the contribution from the 3D porous Cu support and the incorporating agglomeration-free and uniformly distributed CeO2 particles into the Ni-P matrix, the optimal composite coating (porous Cu supported Ni-P/CeO2 (20 g L-1)) exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performance with small overpotentials (η) of 118 and 320 mV at a cathodic current density of 10 and 100 mA cm2. Moreover, the composite electrode also presents excellent electrochemical stability in the alkaline solution. This work provides a feasible option to fabricate composite electrodes that may have desirable electrochemical properties for HER.","Zhou, Qiongyu;Liu, Songli;Zhang, Yadong;Zhu, Zhiyun;Su, Wei;Sheng, Minqi",2020-09-30,Ceramics International,"Ni-P/CeO2,Porous Cu,Composite coating,Electrodeposition,Hydrogen evolution reaction",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.133,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.133
Comparison of microstructure and mechanical properties of plasma-sprayed nanostructured and conventional yttria stabilized zirconia thermal barrier coatings,"The main goal of this paper was to evaluate and compare the microstructure and mechanical properties of plasma-sprayed nanostructured and conventional yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). To this end, NiCrAlY bond coat, nanostructured, and conventional YSZ coatings were deposited on Inconel 738LC substrate by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS). The mechanical properties of the coating were evaluated using nanoindentation and bonding strength tests. The microstructure and phase composition of the coating were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray diffractometry (XRD). The nanostructured YSZ coating contained both nanosized particles retained from the powder and microcolumnar grains formed through the resolidification of the molten part of the powder, whereas the microstructure of the conventional YSZ coating consisted of columnar grain splats only. The phase composition of the as-sprayed nanostructured coating consisted of the non-transformable tetragonal phase, while the conventional coating showed the presence of both the monoclinic and non-transformable tetragonal phases. The results of nanoindentation and bonding strength tests indicated that the mechanical properties of the nanostructured coating were better than those of the conventional coating.","Ghasemi, Reza;Shoja-Razavi, Reza;Mozafarinia, Reza;Jamali, Hossein",2013-12-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Elaboration and characterization of PVP-assisted NiO thin films for enhanced sensitivity toward H2 and NO2 gases,"It is widely demonstrated that the synthesis conditions of sol-gel films have a great impact on their gas sensing properties. In this work, transparent PVP-assisted nickel oxide thin films with an average grain size of ~5 nm were synthesized using two distinctive deposition procedures combining the sol-gel method with the spin-coating technique then tested as optical gas sensors for the detection of hazardous pollutant gases. The first method is ascribed to a typical spin-coating deposition followed by a thermal annealing, and the second method consisted on a multistep coating annealing process. Structural and morphological studies showed enhanced crystallization rate and homogeneous surface morphology using a multistep deposition. The as prepared films exhibit a clear and reversible response toward H2, CO and NO2 gases and the multistep deposition process enhanced the sensitivity of about 113% and 194% toward 1% of H2 and 0.1% of NO2 respectively. The shrinkage of the band gap from 4.07 to 3.91 eV and the increased PL intensity indicate the presence of higher rate of charge density and intrinsic defect states that promoted the sensitivity of the film. Furthermore, improved response intensity was detected in the near UV region and higher stability with fast response was obtained for hydrogen gas.","Zargouni, S.;Derbali, L.;Ouadhour, M.;Rigon, M.;Martucci, A.;Ezzaouia, H.",2019-04-01,Ceramics International,"Nickel oxide,Sol-gel thin films,Nanostructures,Refractive index,Photoluminescence,Optical gas sensors",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.044,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.044
A chromaticity-tunable white LED by screen-printing red phosphor coating on PiG plates,"Currently, phosphor-in-glass (PiG) approach draws great attention because of its excellent thermal resistance and facile process in w-LED fabrication. However, the absence of red emissive component results in poor chromaticity quality, which greatly restricts its application in the high-quality indoor lighting. In the present work, a transparent garnet-based PiG was successfully prepared by introducing the Y3Al4.5Ga0.5O12:Ce3+(YAGG) green phosphor into TeO2-based glass matrix, and we demonstrated the possibility offered by the screen-printing technique for warm w-LED applications by coupling the PiG plate stacked with a red phosphor coating on commercial InGaN LED. The microstructures and luminescent properties of them were investigated in detail. After simply varying the red phosphor concentration as well as the YAGG PiG thickness, a facile chromaticity tuning for the thus-fabricated LED was achieved in the range changing from cool white to warm white. Moreover, this developed luminescent material presented an excellent heat-resistance performance. Hopefully, the red phosphor coated PiG color converter is applicable in the long-lifetime high-power color-tunable w-LEDs.","Xiang, Run;Liang, Xiaojuan;Xi, Qiaoya;Yuan, Zhanfei;Chen, Cirui;Xiang, Weidong",2016-12-31,Ceramics International,"Optical material,Phosphor-in-glass,Multilayer,Printing,Luminescence",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.09.094,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.09.094
Optimisation and biological activities of bioceramic robocast scaffolds provided with an oxygen-releasing coating for bone tissue engineering applications,"Hypoxia is one of the major challenges after scaffold implantation which can lead to cell necrosis and bacterial infection. Using of supplemental oxygen can increase the cell proliferation, encourage the cell differentiation and prevent the infections. Developing an engineered scaffold with a sustained oxygen release is an outstanding way for addressing the challenges of oxygen deficiency. In this study, the bioceramic scaffolds were fabricated from biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) powder with the composition of 60% hydroxyapatite (HA) and 40% beta-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP). The Robocasting technique was utilised for producing a porous structure comprising interpenetrated ceramic rods in a 3-dimensional tetragonal mesh. The scaffold was modelled by the finite element method (FEM) for computing the stress fields and predicting their mechanical performance. Calcium peroxide (CPO), as an oxygen-producing and antimicrobial biomaterial, was mixed with a polycaprolactone (PCL) solution and was coated on the scaffolds by the dip-coating method. The coating layer possessed three different percentages of CPO (1, 3 and 5 wt%). The oxygen-releasing profile proved that this design of coating-scaffold could be effective as a system of oxygen delivery. According to the antibacterial investigations, releasing of CPO from the scaffolds could inhibit the growth of E. coli and S. aureus. SBF tests confirmed that the coated scaffolds because of CPO particles on their surface presented superior apatite precipitation in comparison with the uncoated one. The differentiated osteoblastic function was monitored by measuring the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. The coated BCP scaffolds with 3% and 5% CPO exhibited higher ALP activity compared to the other samples. The results demonstrated that the proposed bioceramic-based scaffolds containing oxygen-generating coating could be optimised to supply an antibacterial performance, ideal mechanical properties, improved ALP activity and higher apatite formation ability. Therefore, these scaffolds can be a promising candidate for applying in bone tissue engineering.","Touri, Maria;Moztarzadeh, Fathollah;Osman, Noor Azuan Abu;Dehghan, Mohammad Mehdi;Mozafari, Masoud",2019-01-31,Ceramics International,"Bioceramic,Biphasic calcium phosphate,Oxygen-releasing coating,3D-printing,Robocasting,Bone tissue engineering",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.247,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.247
Fabrication of durable superhydrophobic coatings with hierarchical structure on inorganic radome materials,"In order to provide an effective damp-proof protection of inorganic radome materials, we have developed a new method to fabricate superhydrophobic coatings, which uses Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and SiO2 micron particles to seal porous surfaces of inorganic radome materials and hydrophobized silica colloid to form superhydrophobic surface. The coatings were characterized by moisture absorption rate analysis, dielectric constant and loss tangent measurements, static contact angle and sliding angle measurements, SEM, AFM, TG, FTIR and wear tests. All of the characterizations revealed the coatings had a micro–nano hierarchical structure with a static contact angle of 157.5° and sliding angle of 9°, and possessed high thermal stability and excellent mechanical durability. These coatings have potential uses in engineering applications of inorganic porous materials requiring damp-proof protection and high durability.","Lei, Yonglin;Wang, Qiuru;Huo, Jichuan",2014-08-31,Ceramics International,"Super-hydrophobic,Coatings,Micro–nano hierarchical structure,Mechanical durability,Radome",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.03.087,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.03.087
Influence of γ-alumina coating on surface properties of direct metal laser sintered 316L stainless steel,"Direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) is an additive manufacturing technique that enables the production of customized and complex shaped stainless steel products. Application of DMLS parts to critical sectors requires enhanced surface properties. Although extensive research has been undertaken by many investigators on γ-alumina coating on conventionally processed SS 316L, there has been no significant exploration of the properties of SS 316 L processed through DMLS process with and without coating. In this study, an attempt has been made to coat γ-alumina ceramics over 316L SS substrate and report its effects. γ-alumina synthesised using sol-gel technique was examined through Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and X- Ray Diffractometer. The coating were 28–36.77 μm thick and had amorphous structures. Characterization on coated substrate displayed a 33.87% increases in hardness and 81.91% increase in roughness. The water contact angle of the coated substrate exceeded bare substrate measurements by over 340. Icorr value of 0.0967 for coated substrate confirmed the anti-corrosive behaviour, which was found to be very much an essential requirements for this study. Compared with conventional processed SS 316L, the performance of DMLS SS 316L, the performance of DMLS SS 316L bare substrate and coated substrate are mainly governed by properties such as porosity, laser scanning effect, in build residual stress and surface finish. The development of uniform and adherent coating of γ-alumina acts as a mechanical barrier for enhancement of the surface properties which will enlighten the research and applications in the fields of biomedical, aerospace and automobile industries.","Sharma, G.

Potassium-based composition for a bioactive glass,"The increasing need for biomedical devices, required to face dysfunctions of natural tissues and organs caused by traumatic events, diseases and simple ageing, has drawn attention onto new materials, that could be able to positively interact with the human body. Among them, Bioglass® is firmly diffused in medical practice, thanks to its high bioactivity. In particular, due to its brittleness, it is mainly applied as a coating onto tougher bionert substrates; nevertheless, its bioactivity may be altered by the crystallization phenomena that could be involved by its processing. With the aim of reducing the tendency to crystallize, a new glass composition, inspired by the 45S5 Bioglass®, was formulated by substituting the sodium oxide with potassium oxide. A parallel characterization of the new glass and the 45S5 Bioglass® was carried out in order to define the effect of the potassium oxide on the thermal behaviour, mechanical properties and bioactivity. The results proved that the thermo-mechanical properties, as well as the in vitro response of the two glasses were comparable; however, preliminary tests to produce glass coatings by enamelling evidenced a higher stability of the new glass that, unlike the 45S5 Bioglass®, did not crystallize during processing.","Cannillo, V.;Sola, A.",2009-12-31,Ceramics International,"B.

Comparison of the physicochemical properties and mineralogy of Chinese (Beihai) and Brazilian kaolin,"Beihai area (China) has about 500 million tons kaolin reserves with potential applications in ceramics, paint, plastic and rubber-filler industries, but unlike the Brazilian kaolin, it is not good in paper-coating industry. In order to understand the differences between Chinese (Beihai) and Brazilian kaolin, their individual physicochemical properties, morphologies, crystal structures, and surface characteristics were systematically investigated and compared. The results showed that the viscosity concentration, specific surface area and zeta potential of Brazilian kaolin were higher than those of Beihai kaolin. SEM and TEM images revealed that Brazilian kaolin had more regular particle shape, smoother surface and larger diameter–thickness ratio than those of Beihai kaolin. Moreover, XRD and TG/DSC analyses exhibited that Beihai kaolin was low ordered kaolinite with lower value of Hinckley index, average flake thickness along c-axis and endothermic peak temperature as compared to Brazilian kaolin. Furthermore, the crystal structures refined by the Rietveld method of Beihai kaolin showed a greater distortion of [SiO4] tetrahedron than that of Brazilian kaolin. It can be concluded that low viscosity concentration, low degree of order, and irregular particle shape of Chinese (Beihai) kaolin are the reasons why it is not suitable for use in the paper-coating industry.","Qiu, Xiumei;Lei, Xinrong;Alshameri, Aref;Wang, Hongquan;Yan, Chunjie",2014-05-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Continuous and varied depth-of-cut turning of gray cast iron by using uncoated and TiN/Al2O3 coated silicon nitride-based ceramic tools,"Silicon nitride-based (Si3N4) ceramic cutting tools are particularly good for high speed machining of gray cast iron due to their high red hardness, wear resistance and chemical stability with gray cast iron. However, the intrinsic brittleness of Si3N4 ceramics makes the cutting tools easy to be damaged when subjected to impact force. In the present work, turning tests on gray cast iron were carried out by using uncoated and CVD TiN/Al2O3 coated Si3N4 cutting tools under continuous turning and varied depth-of-cut turning. Tool wear, tool life, chemical composition on worn flank faces and failure mechanism of the cutting tools after turning tests were studied. The results show that the improved cutting performance of the coated cutting tools can be attributed to the increasing wear resistance and toughness of the cutting tools with the covering of TiN/Al2O3 coatings, both in continuous and varied depth-of-cut turning. The dominant failure mechanism of the cutting tools was abrasive wear in continuous turning and a combination of abrasive wear and chipping in varied depth-of-cut turning. In addition, adhesive wear also found to play a role in the tools failure to some extent for both uncoated and coated Si3N4 cutting tools in continuous and varied depth-of cut turning.","Qin, Jie;Long, Ying;Zeng, Junjie;Wu, Shanghua",2014-09-30,Ceramics International,"Continuous and varied depth-of-cut turning,Failure mechanism,Si3N4 cutting tools,Tool wear",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.04.068,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.04.068
Improved oxidation resistance of expanded graphite through nano SiC coating,"Expanded graphite with nano SiC and amorphous SiCxOy coating was successfully prepared through pyrolysing silane coupling agent (SCA), where the grafting of SCA dominated the final products. The results show that mainly amorphous SiCxOy coating covers expanded graphite at 1000°C, regardless of the SCA concentration. In comparison, nano SiC coating can be synthesized at 1200°C depending on the good dispersion of SCA (with a SCA concentration of 50vol%). The formed SiC coating contributes to much higher peak oxidation temperature (812.1°C) than 678.0°C of the pure expanded graphite. Meanwhile, the oxidation activation energies of expanded graphite are remarkably improved from 149.15kJ/mol to 176.16kJ/mol (based on Kissinger method), attributing to the derived nano SiC and SiCxOy coating.","Liao, Ning;Li, Yawei;Shan, Jiangbo;Zhu, Tianbin;Sang, Shaobai;Jia, Dechang",2018-02-15,Ceramics International,"Expanded graphite,Oxidation resistance,Silane coupling agent,SiC coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.110,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.110
Thermal expansion and thermal conductivity of Sm x Zr1−x O2−x/2 (0.1≤ x ≤0.5) ceramics,"A study was conducted of the effect of additions of samarium oxide on the thermal expansion and thermal conductivity of zirconium oxide for thermal barrier coatings. Sm x Zr1−x O2−x/2 (0.1≤ x ≤0.5) ceramic powders synthesized with a chemical-coprecipitation and calcination method were sintered at 1873K for 15h. Structures of the synthesized powders and sintered ceramics were identified by X-ray diffractometer. The morphologies of ceramic powders were observed by transmission electron microscope. The thermal expansion coefficients and thermal diffusion coefficients of Sm x Zr1−x O2−x/2 ceramics were studied with a high-temperature dilatometer and a laser flash diffusivity technique from room temperature to 1673K. The thermal conductivity was calculated from thermal diffusivity, density and specific heat of bulk ceramics. Sm0.1Zr0.9O1.95 ceramics consists of both monoclinic and tetragonal structures. However, Sm0.2Zr0.8O1.9 and Sm0.3Zr0.7O1.85 ceramics only exhibit a defect fluorite structure. Sm0.4Zr0.6O1.8 and Sm0.5Zr0.5O1.75 ceramics have a pyrochlore-type lattice. With the increase of Sm2O3 content, the linear thermal expansion of Sm x Zr1−x O2−x/2 ceramics increases except for Sm0.1Zr0.9O1.95. The thermal conductivities of Sm x Zr1−x O2−x/2 ceramics ranged from 1.41 at 873K to 1.86Wm−1 K−1 at room temperature in a test temperature range of room temperature to 1673K, and the results can be explained by phonon scattering mechanism.","Liu, Zhan-Guo;Ouyang, Jia-Hu;Wang, Bai-He;Zhou, Yu;Li, Jing",2009-03-31,Ceramics International,"Sm x Zr1−x O2−x/2,Coprecipitation-calcination method,Thermal expansion,Thermal conductivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2008.02.016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2008.02.016
Anodic lithium ion battery material with negative thermal expansion,"Negative thermal expansion materials will effectively counteract possible severe expansion and contraction due to the insertion and extraction of Li ions in lithium ion batteries. Herein, negative thermal expansion ZrScMo2VO12 and its carbon-coating composites are prepared as electrode material in lithium ion batteries by a heating treatment route. The galvanostatic charge/discharge process, cyclic voltammetry measurement and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are tested to relate their thermal expansion and electrochemical properties. The initial specific capacity reaching 1062 mA h g-1 at the current density of 0.2 A g-1 is obtained with ideal negative thermal expansion properties. The reversible specific capacity still remains stable at 310 mA h g-1 for that material coated with carbon after 100 cycles. The corresponding theoretical simulations and in situ XRD patterns propose a Li ion storage mechanism based on Li ion insertion process in open framework structure. As a proof-of-concept research, this work paves a way to the promising application of negative thermal expansion materials in lithium ion batteries and other energy storage systems.","Ge, Xianghong;Yuan, Baohe;Xu, Sen;Xu, Peng;Shi, Yeping;Liu, Yanyan;Li, Zhongshuang;Sun, Qiang;Guo, Juan;Liang, Erjun;Li, Baojun",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"Negative thermal expansion,ZrScMo2VO12,Lithium ion batteries,Framework structure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.248,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.248

The oxidation resistance of the coated specimens was investigated at 1773K. The results show that the SiC–Si–ZrB2 can protect C/C against oxidation at 1773K for more than 386h. The excellent oxidation protective performance is attributed to the integrity and stability of SiO2 glass improved by the formation of ZrSiO4 phase during oxidation.

Influence of ladle slag composition in the dissolution process of the dicalcium silicate (C2S) layer on doloma-C refractories,"Understanding the role of dicalcium silicate (C2S) in the corrosion mechanism of doloma-C refractory during the steel refining process is very important to maximize the performance of these refractories and to ensure the technical requirements of quality and operational safety. In industrial practice the spontaneous formation of dicalcium silicate phase (C2S) on doloma-C brick protects the refractory from slag penetration and is an example of protection by passive corrosion. However, fluxing compounds present in the slag, such as, Al2O3, CaF2 and FeOn can accelerate the dissolution of the C2S layer by the formation of phases of lower melting temperature. Specifically, the influence of the fluxing oxide quantities and the reaction temperature of the phase formation, which leads to melting/dissolution of the C2S, was studied. The thermodynamic simulation (FactSage software) was performed to better understand the reactions aforementioned, and this data was validated through testing in a laboratory furnace with precise control of temperature and atmosphere. The results provide important information to the understanding of the phenomena involved and the optimization of industrial practice.","Cruz, R.T.;Bielefeldt, W.V.;Bragança, S.R.",2017-12-01,Ceramics International,"Dolomitic refractories,Coating,Corrosion,Steelmaking,FactSage",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.076,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.076
Electrochemical stability and bio-mineralization capability of zinc substituted and elemental zinc reinforced calcium phosphate composite coatings synthesized through pulsed electro-deposition,"Recent studies showed that zinc, as one of the essential element in the human body, is able to promote osteoblast proliferation and bone growth when present with calcium phosphate phases. In this study, zinc substituted and zinc reinforced calcium phosphate composites were prepared by electro chemical deposition from aqueous electrolyte bath. Nucleation rate and reaction time were varied to understand the relation between in-situ formation mechanism of various phases with the varying reaction kinematics and kinetics. The thin functional composite coatings were compared in terms of their surface morphology, lattice structure, surface elemental composition and related electrochemical corrosion resistance along with bio-mineralization capability under simulated body fluid (SBF). On a particular parameter of 10 mA/cm2 current density and 20% duty cycle, nano tubes enriched in elemental zinc; hopeite and calcium orthophosphate composite phases are formed. This unique microstructural morphology and composition make the coating surface 10 times more electrochemical corrosion resistant compared to all other coatings. A high amount of zinc substitution in calcium phosphate phases leads to the development of high compressive lattice strain, which in turn results in rapid dissolution of the coating under contact with SBF. During bio-mineralization, the zinc loading ratio is rapidly decreased for the initial 7 days through preferential dissolution and enrichment in calcium ions and subsequently stabilized at 60% from the initial 83% in nano tube structures. The effective adherence of osteoconduction product on the nano tube structure is achieved post 14 days. In summary, electrochemical deposition was found as an effective way to design various tailor-made/functionally graded zinc-calcium phosphate composite coatings based on specific requirements of biodegradability, biocompatibility and surface properties.","Chakraborty, Rajib;Mandal, Monalisa;Saha, Partha",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Zinc substituted calcium phosphate,Zinc-calcium phosphate composites,Bio-mineralization,Composite bio-coatings,Electrochemical behaviour,Pulsed electro-deposition",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.333,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.333

Qualitative description on channel cracking in ceramic type coatings due to substrate tension using 3D discrete element method,"The objective of this work is to simulate qualitatively the initiation and propagation mechanism of channeling cracks in ceramic coatings due to uniaxial and biaxial substrate tension. Most of the previous simulations on damage evolution in coating/substrate structures were performed in 2D; however, in the current study, to demonstrate the damage evolution both in coating thickness and surface, several numerical simulation was performed in the 3D space frame. To this end, a FORTRAN code of Discrete Element Method (DEM) with Euler-Bernoulli beam bond elements and the random spherical arrangement was developed. Furthermore, the brittle fracture criterion was assigned for the coating while the substrate was considered to have linear elastic and isotropic behavior and to remain intact during loading. Three unit cells with the same dimensions and different coating thicknesses were considered. It was found that the coating thickness affects the damage initiation mechanism. In both uniaxial and biaxial tension, the increase of the coating thickness resulted in damage initiation near the interface and propagation to the top surface. At the surface view, the results showed that the free surfaces and edges could be susceptible to damage initiation in thin coatings.","Ghasemi, M.A.;Falahatgar, S.R.",2020-04-01,Ceramics International,"Discrete element method,3D space frame,Channeling crack,Crack growth simulation,Random spherical packing",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.198,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.198
Thermal shock resistance and bonding strength of tri-layer Yb2SiO5/mullite/Si coating on SiCf/SiC composites,"A Yb2SiO5/mullite/Si tri-layer environmental-barrier-coating (EBC) were coated on SiCf/SiC substrates via Air Plasma Spraying (APS). The thermal cycle tests (TCT) were conducted under thermal corrosive condition of vapor-oxygen (50 vol% H2O and 50 vol% O2) with thermal shock from 1200 °C to 200 °C. Microstructures, weight loss and bonding strength of the samples were systemically investigated after 101, 396, 606 and 700 TCT cycles respectively. The results show that the corner of the tri-layer coating peel off from the sample with weight loss of 1.3% after 700 TCT cycles. The bonding strength between substrate and tri-layer coatings gradually decreases to 6.79 MPa (approximately 55.2% of virgin specimens) after 700 cycles due to thermal shock induced cracks distributed horizontally within Si layers and between Si layer and outer layers.","Yang, Haitang;Yang, Yanping;Cao, Xueqiang;Huang, Xiaozhong;Li, Yang",2020-12-01,Ceramics International,"Environmental barrier coating,Ytterbium silicates,Thermal cycle test",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.214,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.214
High-voltage electrochemical performance of LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathode materials via Al concentration gradient modification,"Al2O3-modified LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathode material is successfully synthesized via a facile carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)-assisted wet method followed by a high-temperature calcination process. Al concentration gradient doping and accompanying formation of Al-coating are simultaneously accomplished in the modified samples. XRD and EDS analysis demonstrate that Al element is successfully doped into the crystal lattice with concentration gradient distribution inside the particles, reducing the Li/Ni cation mixing and stabilizing the layered structure. The compact distribution of Al on the surface forms a protective layer between the electrodes and the electrolyte, prohibiting the harmful side reactions and phase transition on the interphase. Compared with the pristine, the modified material with 2000 ppm Al2O3 (Al-2000) shows the best high-voltage performance with the capacity retention increased by ~13.3% from 138.3 to 163.0 mAh g−1 at 1 C in 3.0–4.6 V after 100 cycles. Even under the high current rate of 8 C (1240 mAh g−1) after 200 cycles, the Al-2000 still exhibits a capacity retention of 88.6%, greater than 80.3% for the pristine. Furthermore, results from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements confirm the roles of the Al2O3 modification in decreasing polarization and electrochemical resistances, contributing to the kinetic process of electrodes.","Lei, Tongxing;Li, Yunjiao;Su, Qianye;Cao, Guolin;Li, Wei;Chen, Yongxiang;Xue, Longlong;Deng, Shiyi",2018-06-01,Ceramics International,"LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2,Concentration gradient modification,High-voltage performance,Side reaction",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.053,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.053
Effect of Sr substitution on the air-stability of perovskite solar cells,"By using a two-step spin-coating method, 10 mol% SrI2 and 10 mol% SrCl2-substituted perovskite films were synthesized and utilized to construct mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (PSCs), respectively. The influences of Sr substitutions on the humidity and thermal stability of PSCs were systematically investigated. It is indicated that both 10 mol% SrI2 substitution and 10 mol% SrCl2 substitution can enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSC to more than 15%. The 10 mol% SrCl2 substitution can improve the humidity resistance of perovskite films, which is conducive to inhibiting the increase of perovskite's defect density caused by humidity. After storing at 20 ± 5 °C, 30 ± 5%RH for 21 d, the 10 mol% SrCl2-substituted PSC can still maintain 84% of the initial efficiency. However, the 10 mol% SrI2-substituted PSC exhibits a strong humidity sensitivity, which results in the increase of series resistance and the decrease of recombination impedance, thus making the PCE decrease to less than 20% of the initial value after storing at 20 ± 5 °C, 30 ± 5%RH for 21 d. As for the thermal stability of PSCs, both the 10 mol% SrI2 and 10 mol% SrCl2-substituted perovskite films exhibit a certain thermal resistance. After 18 thermal cycles, both the 10 mol% SrI2 and 10 mol% SrCl2-substituted PSCs can maintain over 90% of the initial PCEs.","Zhang, Huanyu;Li, Rui;Zhang, Mei;Guo, Min",2020-06-15,Ceramics International,"Sr-substituted perovskites,Perovskite solar cells,Thermal stability,Humidity stability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.203,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.203

The coatings were grown from an YSZ ceramic target symmetrically covered with metallic (Al, Ag) pieces on AISI 316L steel substrates, via the RF sputtering technique. The microstructure of the coatings was characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), the chemical composition was determined through X-ray dispersive energy (EDX) analysis, and the electrochemical response was evaluated via impedance (EIS) and Tafel corrosion techniques. The XRD analysis showed that the coatings exhibited peaks belonging to the target material, dopant elements, and oxides such as Al2O3. Electrochemical analysis indicated an increase in the corrosion resistance of the coatings grown on aluminum oxide.","Amado, M. Moreno;Alfonso, J.E.;Florez, J.J.

Antibacterial activity of silver photodeposited nepheline thin film coatings,"Antibacterial characteristic of silver makes this material very appealing for surface coating on various substrates. In this study, we investigated different silver containing powder for this purpose. Specifically we examined the antibacterial activity of Ag/nepheline compared with Ag/TiO2 and Ag/SiO2. Our analysis suggested “Ag/nepheline” composite thin film is an appropriate coating for production of antibacterial ceramic tiles in large scale. In our investigation, FactSage software was used for the thermodynamic analysis. Nano-silver was obtained from silver nitrate solution by ultraviolet illumination of distilled water. In this process, silver was doped on micronized TiO2, SiO2, or nepheline. The silver composites and monolithic silver were sprayed with water on raw tiles and sintered in a furnace. Exploring the results suggested the best component for achieving antibacterial tile is Ag/nepheline.","Ghafari-Nazari, Ali;Moztarzadeh, Fathollah;Rabiee, Sayed Mahmood;Rajabloo, Talieh;Mozafari, Masoud;Tayebi, Lobat",2012-09-30,Ceramics International,"B.

Effect of microstructure on the adhesion strength of TiB x coating on Ti6Al4V substrate,"TiB x coatings were deposited on Ti6Al4V and Si (100) wafer substrates by D.C. magnetron sputtering with various target-to-substrate distances (T.S. distances) from 50 mm to 200 mm. The influence of T.S. distance on the microstructure, hardness and adhesion strength of TiB x coatings and Ti6Al4V substrate system was investigated. Results showed that the microstructure of TiB x coatings transformed from dense to fibre columnar grain with the increase in T.S. distance, whilst the hardness decreased from 20.9 GPa to 9.4 GPa. The Rockwell-C indentation adhesion strength grade was also improved from HF6 to HF1. An adhesion evaluation factor G, which is related to the mechanical properties and the microstructure of TiB x coating, is proposed based on the test results. The adhesion strength increased with G, which corresponded well with the results of indentation test. The high-speed rubbing test with a sliding speed of 300 m/s was performed to check the Al-adhesion resistance of the TiB x coating against Al–hBN seal coating.","Wu, Bi;Gao, Siyang;Xue, Weihai;Li, Shu;Duan, Deli",2020-10-15,Ceramics International,"Titanium diboride,Magnetron sputtering,Microstructure,Adhesion strength,High-speed rubbing",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.078,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.078
"Morphological, structural and ellipsometric investigations of Cr doped TiO2 thin films prepared by sol–gel and spin coating","Pure and chromium doped titanium dioxide (TiO2) thin films at different atomic percentages (0.5%, 1.3% and 2.9%) have been elaborated on ITO/Glass substrates by sol–gel and spin–coating methods using titanium (IV) isopropoxide as a precursor. The surface morphology of films was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), the structure was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and high resolution transmission microscopy (HRTEM). SEM and HRTEM show homogenous and polycrystalline films. XRD patterns indicate a phase transition from anatase to anatase-rutile leading to expand the absorption band of TiO2 molecules around 520cm−1 in FTIR spectra. The optical constants such as the refractive index (n), the extinction coefficient (K) and the band gap (Eg ) as well as the film thickness are determined using spectroscopic ellipsometry technique and Fourouhi–Blommer dispersion model. Results show three major changes; (i) the thickness of pure TiO2 layer is 54nm, which linearly decreases when the layer is doped with chromium and reaches 33nm for a doping concentration of 2.9%, (ii) the band gap energy (Eg ) is also linearly reduced from 3.24eV to 2.80eV when the Cr-doping agent increases, and, (iii) a phase transition from anatase to anatase-rutile is observed causing an increase in values of n(λ) for wavelength greater than 350nm.","Bsiri, N.;Zrir, M.A.;Bardaoui, A.;Bouaїcha, M.",2016-07-31,Ceramics International,"Sol–gel,Chromium doped TiO2,Ellipsometry,Band gap,Thickness,Optical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.03.145,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.03.145
Influence of microstructure flaws on the tribological performance of Cr-based thermal-sprayed ceramic coatings,"The technique of thermal spraying has been proposed since several years ago, as an alternative to Cr electrodeposition, a process characterized by the need of post-deposition handling of a large amount of toxic slurry wastes. Chromium oxide and chromium carbide coatings, as well as Cr electrodeposits find applications, mainly, on the wear protection of metallic components participating in several tribosystems. In the present study, three different thermal spraying techniques were applied for the deposition of such ceramic coatings onto stainless steel substrates; namely, Flame Spraying (FS) and Atmospheric Plasma Spraying (APS) were employed for the deposition of chromium oxide coatings, whilst High Velocity Oxygen Fuel (HVOF) technique for the elaboration of chromium carbide ones. Post-deposition evaluation of the coatings with respect to dry sliding against an Al2O3 ball and a cBN-coated conical insert, as well as three-body abrasion performance according to the ASTM G65 technical specification, demonstrated that the APS oxide coatings exhibited superior tribological behavior during both tests, despite the fact that their microstructure was not free of flaws. Compared to APS ones, FS oxide coatings exhibited lower three-body abrasion resistance; however, their dry sliding wear resistance was of the same order of magnitude, being only marginally lower. This last characteristic advocates for the use of the much more flexible FS technique for the elaboration of chromium oxide coatings for applications where relatively low shear stresses are expected to be encountered. Finally, the HVOF carbide coatings showed intermediate three-body abrasion resistance but high sliding wear, the latter attributed to both microstructure flaws and in-flight decomposition of the feedstock carbide powder during deposition.","Psyllaki, P.;Mourlas, A.;Vourlias, G.;Pavlidou, E.;Vardavoulias, M.",2019-10-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal spraying,Cr2O3 coatings,Cr-carbide coatings,Tribological performance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.188,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.188
Facile synthesis of micro-spherical LiMn0.7Fe0.3PO4/C cathodes with advanced cycle life and rate performance for lithium-ion battery,"A series of micro-spherical LiMn0.7Fe0.3PO4/C (LMFP) cathode materials are synthesized via co-precipitation method combining spray drying and solid-state reaction. All as-prepared materials are well-characterized to determine their crystal structure, morphology and electrochemical performance. All as-obtained LMFP materials correspond to orthorhombic olivine structure with Pbnm space group and show uniform porous spherical structure with an average particle size of 3µm and a carbon coating layer of about 3nm. In particular, the resulting LMFP material prepared at 600°C exhibits a high discharge capacity of 160mAhg−1 at 0.1C. Even at a high rate of 10C, it can still deliver 133mAhg−1 and maintain capacity retention of 84.9% after 200 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance is ascribed to the synergetic effect of porous micro-spherical structure and uniform carbon coating layer.","Yang, Li;Wang, Yan;Wu, Jinhua;Xiang, Mingwu;Li, Jianlong;Wang, Boya;Zhang, Yun;Wu, Hao;Liu, Heng",2017-04-15,Ceramics International,"Co-precipitation,Spray drying,Porous micro-spherical structure,LiMn0.7Fe0.3PO4/C,Lithium-ion batteries",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.025
High temperature oxidation resistance of metal silicide incorporated ZrB2 composite coatings prepared by vacuum plasma spray,"Metal silicides are often utilized to enhance high temperature oxidation resistance for refractory ZrB2 ceramics or coatings owing to the capability to form glassy silica layer. However, the role of metal elements in silicides on maintaining the glassy layer needs to be elucidated. In the present study, TaSi2 and MoSi2 incorporated ZrB2 composite coatings were respectively prepared by vacuum plasma spray (VPS) technology and their oxidation behaviors were comparatively investigated. The oxidation tests carried out in ambient air at 1773K confirmed the crucial function of glassy silica layer on high temperature oxidation resistance for both of the metal silicide incorporated ZrB2 coatings. More importantly, the metal elements in silicide additives were revealed to have great influence on the integrity of glassy silica layer. The oxidation of element Ta in TaSi2 generated plate-like compound TaZr2.75O8, which impaired the consistency and completeness of silica layer, creating opportunity for oxygen diffusion. However, MoB, the oxidation product of element Mo in MoSi2, could help supporting the integrity of silica layer. MoB played the role defending the wholeness of silica layer and reducing the evaporation of B2O3 and MoO3 at the same time. Better oxidation resistance of ZrB2–MoSi2 composite coating was found as compared with ZrB2–TaSi2 composite coating.","Wang, Zhong;Niu, Yaran;Hu, Cui;Li, Hong;Zeng, Yi;Zheng, Xuebin;Ren, Musu;Sun, Jinliang",2015-12-31,Ceramics International,"TaSi2,MoSi2,ZrB2-based composite coatings,Vacuum plasma spray,Oxidation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.08.015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.08.015

In INGS/C, small graphite flakes are packed in disordered orientation and form an isotropic structure, which may effectively reduce local stress concentration appearing in the process of Li+ insertion/extraction. The pyrolytic carbon decomposed from polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and citric acid is connecting the small graphite flakes and coating on the surface of INGS, respectively, thus forms a continuous conductive network to improve the electron transmission and maintain the micro-structural integrity of isotropic natural graphite spheres as well. With the help of synergetic effect between the isotropic structure of INGS and the continuous conductive network, the INGS/C electrode exhibits superior rate capability of 346mAhg−1 at 3C at low potential below 0.25V.","Wu, Xuan;Yang, Xuelin;Zhang, Fei;Cai, Liangting;Zhang, Lulu;Wen, Zhaoyin",2017-08-15,Ceramics International,"Lithium-ion battery,Anode material,Natural graphite,Carbon coating,Isotropic",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.123,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.123
Preparation and enhancement of mullite reticulated porous ceramics for porous media combustion,"The insufficient strength and thermal shock resistance of mullite reticulated porous ceramics (RPC) limited their application in porous media combustion. To strengthen mullite RPC, the struts with three layers were prepared using the combined approaches of polymeric replica and vacuum infiltration. The effects of residual stress within the struts on thermal shock resistance of mullite RPC were investigated by finite element analysis (FEA). The results showed that the strut was composed of the coating of reaction-bonded mullite, middle layer of mullite skeleton and the triangular filling layer. The triangular voids and surface cracks were eliminated in the formed struts, resulting in a higher strength of mullite RPC than that of hollow strut. In addition, FEA results indicated that the residual compressive stress formed in the coating of strut after mullite RPC was sintered at 1450 °C and 1500 °C, while the residual tensile stress formed at 1550 °C. The larger residual compressive stress within the strut coating was beneficial to enhance the thermal shock resistance of mullite RPC.","Liang, Xiong;Li, Yawei;Pan, Liping;Sang, Shaobai;Zhu, Tianbin;Li, Benwen;Aneziris, Christos G.",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Mullite reticulated porous ceramics,Filled struts,Residual stress,Thermal shock resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.246,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.246
Effect of Y2O3 addition on tribological properties of plasma sprayed Al2O3-13% TiO2 coating,"The effect of Y2O3 addition on structure, mechanical properties and tribological properties of Al2O3-13 wt% TiO2 coating was investigated. The addition of 20 wt% Y2O3 resulted in better densification, stabilization of alpha (α) alumina phase and improvement in fracture toughness of Al2O3-13 wt% TiO2 coating. Abrasive wear tests were performed over a range of loads and sliding speeds. The stabilization of α alumina phase further increased with an increase in severity of wear test conditions, as noted from X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of worn coatings. Al2O3-13 wt% TiO2-20 wt% Y2O3 coating displayed lower friction coefficient and lower abrasive wear rate than Al2O3-13 wt% TiO2 coating, which was due to synergistic effect of α alumina phase and formation of magneli phase oxide of titanium; Ti2O3. Friction energy map was used to rationalize observed wear rates, to identify different regimes of wear and degradation modes of coatings.","Mehar, Sanket;Sapate, S.G.;Vashishtha, Nitesh;Bagde, Pranay",2020-06-01,Ceramics International,"Ceramic coating,Abrasion,Friction,Fracture,Friction energy",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.214,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.214

Effect of controlled segmentation on the thermal cycling behavior of plasma sprayed YSZ thick coatings,"This work is the 2nd part of the previous work done in the series; where, for the first time controlled segmentation crack densities have been developed manually in the coatings, even after the coating deposition. Atmospheric plasma sprayed (APS) Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)-coatings are deposited on Ni-based superalloy IN738. Thermal cycling performance was tested before and after the development of controlled segmentation crack densities in the coatings at 1150°C for 500 cycles. In the present work, failure mechanisms in un-segmented coating and alongside the effect of controlled segmentation on the thermal cycling behavior of plasma sprayed YSZ thick coatings are investigated. Results show a promising strain tolerance behavior for the segmented coatings, whereas regular conventional (un-segmented) coating could not sustain at higher temperature after its thermal cycling test. Coating microstructures reveal that four types of coating failure were observed in un-segmented regular coating and it happened due to the formation of thermally grown oxide (TGO). Whereas, segmentation helps to control the excess formation of TGO and therefore a very thin layer of TGO was observed in segmented coating and obvious no coating failure or spallation occurred.","Tailor, Satish;Modi, Ankur;Modi, S.C.",2018-04-15,Ceramics International,"Segmentation,Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs),Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ),Thermal cycling test,Coating failure mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.094,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.094
Effect of surface textures and electrohydrodynamically atomized WS2 films on the friction and wear properties of ZrO2 coatings,"The combination of WS2 films and surface textures were investigated for improving the friction and wear properties of sol-gel ZrO2 coatings. Grid-like grooves with different groove pitch were fabricated by laser surface texturing technology. All the textured coatings showed improved hydrophilicity (the contact angle of ZrO2 coatings decreased by ~ 3.5–22.8% after texturing). WS2 films were deposited on the ZrO2 coatings by electrohydrodynamic atomization technology. The dry sliding friction and wear properties of samples with surface textures or/and WS2 films additive were evaluated. Both the coefficient of friction of ZrO2 coatings and steel ball wear rate were affected by laser surface texturing and WS2 films additive. The textured samples with the texture coverage of 0.679 showed the lowest friction coefficient and lowest steel ball wear rate, decreasing by ~ 16% and ~ 70%, respectively, when comparing with those of the untextured samples. The further improved antifriction and antiwear properties were obtained by the synergistic combination of surface textures and deposited WS2 films. Additionally, laser surface micro-texturing could contribute to prolong the WS2 films wear life and magnify its lubricating effect.","Li, Xuemu;Deng, Jianxin;Zhang, Liangliang;Liu, Yayun;Yue, Hongzhi;Duan, Ran;Ge, Dongliang",2019-01-31,Ceramics International,"ZrO2 coatings,Laser textures,Electrohydrodynamic atomization deposition,WS2 films,Friction and wear properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.281,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.281
Electrolytic deposition of fluorine-doped hydroxyapatite/ZrO2 films on titanium for biomedical applications,"A novel method of electrolytic fluorine-doped hydroxyapatite/ZrO2 double-layer coating was conducted on medical titanium in ZrO(NO3)2 aqueous solution and subsequently in the mixed solution of Ca(NO3)2, NH4H2PO4 and NaF. The microstructure, phase composition, bond strength, dissolution rate and corrosion resistance of the films were studied. Results revealed that the additions of F− reduced the crystallite and increased the crystallinity of hydroxyapatite, structure of apatite was changed from micro-petal-like crystals to nano-needle-like crystals, which aligned vertically to the substrate. The approximately 10μm thick layers was much denser and uniform. Addition of ZrO2 buffer layer could improve the bond strength between the fluorine-doped hydroxyapatite layer and the substrate. The bond strength of the double-layer coating was found to be significantly higher than that of pure hydroxyapatite coating even after soaking in normal saline for two weeks.

Effects of SiC whiskers on the mechanical properties and microstructure of SiC ceramics by reactive sintering,"As-received and pre-coated SiC whiskers (SiCw)/SiC ceramics were prepared by phenolic resin molding and reaction sintering at 1650°C. The influence of SiCw on the mechanical behaviors and morphology of the toughened reaction-bonded silicon carbide (RBSC) ceramics was evaluated. The fracture toughness of the composites reinforced with pre-coated SiCw reached a peak value of 5.6MPam1/2 at 15wt% whiskers, which is higher than that of the RBSC with as-received SiCw (fracture toughness of 3.4MPam1/2). The surface of the whiskers was pre-coated with phenolic resin, which could form a SiC coating in situ after carbonization and reactive infiltration sintering. The coating not only protected the SiC whiskers from degradation but also provided moderate interfacial bonding, which is beneficial for whisker pull-out, whisker bridging and crack deflection.","Song, Ning;Zhang, Hai-bin;Liu, Hong;Fang, Jing-zhon",2017-06-15,Ceramics International,"SiC whiskers,Silicon carbide,Coating,Reactive sintering,Mechanical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.02.095,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.02.095
Effects of the single layer CVD BN interface on mechanical properties of oxide–oxide composites fabricated by a sol–gel process,"In order to improve mechanical properties of continuous oxide fiber-reinforced oxide (oxide/oxide) composites by tailoring the fiber/matrix (F/M) interface, amorphous boron nitride (BN) coating was applied to the ALF FB3 fibers by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Subsequent high temperature heat-treatment could not only enhance the crystalline of the as-processed BN coating, but also contribute to severe fiber degradation. Three dimensional (3D) ALF FB3/oxide composites were fabricated by a sol–gel process using diphasic Al2O3–SiO2 sols as precursor. The interfacial characteristics were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The effects of BN coating on composite mechanical properties were evaluated by three-point bending test. The results show that the BN interface plays a key role in improving the toughness and strength of the composites. The three-point flexural strength of the composites with BN interface is 81.5MPa, approximately 1.95 times of that for the composites without BN interface (41.9MPa). Besides, microstructure analysis reveals that BN coating became porous in final composites due to the hydrolyzation of BN during the sol–gel process.","Wang, Yi;Cheng, Haifeng;Wang, Jun",2014-06-30,Ceramics International,"A.

A 50Hf10Zr40Si alloy ingot was prepared and infiltrated into a C/C preform at temperatures much lower than the melting point of the alloy to obtain the HfC-based coating. An obvious layered microstructure of the coating was formed. The carbonization reactions occurring between Hf and carbon of the surface layer of the C/C composite is the primary reason for the reactive melt infiltration process to proceed at relative low temperatures. Acetylene flame test showed that the HfC-based coating protected the C/C composite from serious oxidation.,"Ye, Yicong;Zhang, Hong;Tong, Yonggang;Bai, Shuxin",2013-07-31,Ceramics International,"HfC,Coating,Reactive melt infiltration,C/C composite",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.12.059,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.12.059
Microstructure and fracture toughness of in-situ nanocomposite coating by thermal spraying of Ti3AlC2/Cu powder,"The low fracture toughness of ceramic coatings has always hindered their wide application. In this study, an in-situ nanocomposite coating was prepared by the atmospheric plasma spraying of a 50 wt% Ti3AlC2-50 wt% Cu mixed powder. The in-situ nanocomposite coating was found to have an unusual microstructure with a nano-micrometre phase synergistic enhancement, which consisted of submicrometre-thick layers of Cu and nanoparticles of Cu(Al), Ti4O5, TiO2, and Al2TiO5. Thus, in the spraying process, Al was delinked out of Ti3AlC2, forming a large amount of plastic Cu(Al) with Cu. The delinked channel provided a path for Cu to diffuse into Ti3AlC2, which a spatial Cu network structure was formed in the coating. The in-situ nanocomposite coating has high fracture toughness and crack growth resistance by a three-point bending test. This paper reports a new method to prepare a high-fracture-toughness composite ceramic coating.","Li, Qiaolei;Yuan, Xiaohu;Xu, Hao;Song, Peng;Li, Qing;Lü, Kaiyue;Huang, Taihong;Li, Chao;Lu, Jiansheng",2019-07-31,Ceramics International,"Ti3AlC2/Cu,Nanocomposite coating,Fracture toughness,Ceramic,Thermal spraying",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.246,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.246
"In situ synthesis, fabrication and Rietveld refinement of the hydroxyapatite/titania composite coatings on 316L SS","The development of Hydroxyapatite (HAP)/Titania (TiO2) composite coatings on metallic implants have received a great deal of attention during the recent years owing to their superior advantages in biomedical applications. The present study has focused on the in situ formation of HAP/TiO2 composite powders through aqueous precipitation technique. Five different HAP/TiO2 composite powders of varied HAP to TiO2 ratios has been synthesized in the present study and the results were compared with the stoichiometric HAP, Rutile TiO2 and Anatase TiO2 which also have been synthesized by adapting a similar synthetic procedure. All the synthesized powders have been analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) techniques. Rietveld Refinement technique has been employed to generate quantitative information about the structural characteristics and phase content in all the powder samples. Further, the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method has been employed to fabricate HAP/TiO2 composite coatings on 316L SS and the resultant coatings were analyzed for its quantitative structural characteristics. The results from the present investigation has confirmed that concentration of TiO2 in the HAP/TiO2 composites and heat treatment temperatures have played a major role in the degradation of HAP to β-Tricalcium phosphate and also in the conversion of Anatase to Rutile TiO2 phase.","Sarkar, A.;Kannan, S.",2014-06-30,Ceramics International,"B.

The comparison of structure and properties in DC magnetron sputtered and HiPIMS W-C:H coatings with different hydrogen content,"The comparison of the structure, composition, hardness and friction behavior of DCMS and HiPIMS W-C:H coatings made by hybrid reactive deposition in the presence of C2H2 and H2 in Ar atmosphere revealed a transition from textured to columnar-like structures with the increased addition of acetylene in DCMS coatings whereas only amorphous-like structures were produced by HiPIMS. The hybrid sputtering involves acetylene and hydrogen dissociation and recombination reactions in the plasma resulting in the generation of carbon as well as –CH3 and =CH2 radicals which are chemisorbed at the growing coating surface. The concentration of hydrogen in carbon matrix seems to be controlled by –CH3 and =CH2 radicals and not by the amount of molecular hydrogen. The main advantage of HiPIMS compared to DCMS technology includes coefficients of dry friction below 0.1 attributed to the formation of lubricious transfer layer at moderate level of hardness (around 20 GPa) over the studied acetylene additions range. Hybrid HiPIMS technology seems to offer possibilities for substantial COF decrease without hardness degradation which results in widening of the potential of W-C:H coatings for practical engineering applications.","Lofaj, František;Kabátová, Margita;Klich, Marek;Vaňa, Dušan;Dobrovodský, Jozef",2019-05-31,Ceramics International,"Hydrogenated W-C:H coatings,Hybrid magnetron sputtering,HiPIMS,Hardness,Coefficient of friction",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.219,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.219
Theoretical and experimental investigation of secondary electron emission characteristics of MgO coating produced by atomic layer deposition,"Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is utilized to prepare thin MgO coatings 1–50 nm on Si substrate. In addition, secondary electron emission (SEE) coefficient of MgO/Si double-layered structure is evaluated as a function of coating thickness and primary electron (PE) energy. After neutralizing the surface of test specimen, we have accurately analyzed the relationship between secondary electron yield (SEY) of MgO coating and PE energy. Meanwhile, SEE characteristics of MgO/Si double-layered structure have been systematically analyzed. A maximum SEY value of 6.15 has been achieved at coating thickness of 30 nm and PE energy of 550 eV. Furthermore, theoretical model is established by using Dionne's SEE model to analyze experimentally measured SEY data, demonstrating consistency between experimentally measured and theoretically calculated results. This work demonstrates that SEE level of MgO coating can be optimized by tuning coating thickness and presents novel insights into SEE characteristics of composite materials. Those results can serve as a baseline for further design and fabrication of a wide array of electronic devices.","Guo, Junjiang;Wang, Dan;Wen, Kaile;Xu, Yantao;Zhu, Xiangping;Liu, Lutao;Cao, Weiwei;Si, Jinhai;Lu, Min;Guo, Haitao",2020-04-15,Ceramics International,"MgO coating,Secondary electron emission,Atomic layer deposition (ALD),Microchannel plate (MCP)",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.067,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.067
Sol-gel coated enamel for steel: 250 days of continuous high-temperature stability,"Two types of thermally durable and heat-resistant enamel coatings were applied to steel alloys. Three-layer TiO2-SiO2 sol-gel films were grown by a dip-coating method on an enamelled metal alloy to maintain and protect their properties from undesired environmental impact. The enamel coatings withstood 6000h at 600°C, retaining their colour while staying hard and adhering firmly to the metal surface. A three-layer sol-gel coating improved the chemical resistance of the enamelled metal by 6% (0h), 29% (3000h), and 28% (6000h) at 600°C. Throughout the whole treatment at 600°C, the enamel coatings maintained their microhardness and even increased it from 3.6 to 4.4GPa.","Mezinskis, Gundars;Pavlovska, Ilona;Malnieks, Kaspars;Bidermanis, Laimons;Cimmers, Andris;Onufrijevs, Pavels",2017-02-15,Ceramics International,"Enamel for steel A.

On the microstructure and wear resistance of Fe-based composite coatings processed by plasma cladding with B4C injection,"Fe-based composite coatings were fabricated on Q235 steel substrate by plasma cladding. B4C particles were injected at the center and edge of the melting pool as strengthening phase. Scanning electron microscopy and pin-on-disc tribometer were applied to study the microstructure and wear resistance of the coatings. The results showed that the central injected B4C particles dissolved during plasma cladding and cementite generated. Edge injected B4C particles remained and performed metallurgical bonding with the metal matrix. With Fe-based coating containing edge injected B4C particles, wear resistance increased largely and the wear rate became 1/8 of the Q235 substrate. Afterwards, Fe-based coatings with edge injected B4C particles were prepared on real pieces of 50 picks and 12 chutes, which were taken into field probations. Average service lives of the coated picks and chutes increased 3.4 times and 5.6 times, respectively, compared with the conventional 16Mn and 42CrMo pick and chute components.","Lyu, Yezhe;Sun, Yufu;Jing, Fengyu",2015-11-30,Ceramics International,"A.

"Deposition behavior and characteristics of hydroxyapatite coatings on Al2O3, Ti, and Ti6Al4V formed by a chemical bath method","A simple chemical bath method was used to deposit hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings on Al2O3, Ti, and Ti6Al4V substrates at ambient pressure by heating to 65–95°C in an aqueous solution prepared with Ca(NO3)2·4H2O, KH2PO4, KOH, and EDTA. The deposition behavior, morphology, thickness, and phase of the coatings were investigated using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometry. The bonding strength of the coatings was measured using an epoxy resin method. The HA coatings deposited on the three kinds of substrates were fairly dense and uniform and exhibited good crystallinity without any additional heat treatment. A coating thickness of 1–1.8μm was obtained for the samples coated once. By repeating the coating process three times, the thickness could be increased to 4.5μm on the Al2O3 substrate. The bonding strength of these coatings was 18MPa.","Lee, Lak-Hyoung;Ha, Jung-Soo",2014-05-31,Ceramics International,"B. Electron microscopy,B. X-ray methods,D. Apatite,D.

Tribological behavior of nanostructured high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) thermal sprayed WC-17NiCr coatings,"In this research, the nanostructured WC-17NiCr cermet coatings were developed using the high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) thermal spraying processes on ACI CD4MCu cast duplex stainless steel substrates, widely used in pump industry for abrasive wear protection of surfaces. The coatings, sprayed by both robotic and manual methods, had two different fuel (methane) to oxygen ratios (FTOR), namely 0.68 and 0.62. Using different analytical and microstructural techniques, the microstructural characteristics of the powder particles and mechanical, microstructural, and tribological properties of the coatings were determined. Different morphologies were assigned to sprayable particles, namely spherical, apple, donut, irregular, and mixed. It was revealed that the rate of WC decarburization had increased with increasing the FTOR. In contrast, the scanning electron microscopy and image analyses showed that the lowest porosity percentage was obtained for the robotically-sprayed coating with 0.68 FTOR. The Vickers microhardness increased along with fracture toughness, which can be attributed to the effect of the ‘duplex structure’ associated with the particle outer coating of Co and is a novelty in the research. The pin-on-disk reciprocal sliding wear tests at various loadings had shown different wear rates in the coatings. It was inferred that the wear performance was improved with the microstructural homogeneity, hardness, and the fracture toughness in the coatings. In all coatings, lower coefficient of friction (COF) was observed at higher loads. Finally, the wear mechanisms involved in the wear processes were identified as deformation and removal of the binder, fracture and pullout of the carbide particles, and delamination and spallation of the splats.","Asgari, Hamed;Saha, Gobinda;Mohammadi, Mohsen",2017-02-01,Ceramics International,"Nanostructured coatings,WC-17NiCr cermet,Duplex outer layer,HVOF,Sliding wear",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.193,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.193
Optical properties of amorphous Al2O3 thin films prepared by a sol–gel process,"Using Al(NO3)3·9H2O as a precursor, optically transparent Al2O3 thin films have been successfully synthesized by combining a sol–gel spin-coating process with one of two different annealing methods. One set of samples was subjected to a conventional annealing process (C.A) at 700°C for 2h in a muffle furnace, while the other set was exposed to a microwave annealing process (M.A) at 700°C for 30min in a microwave oven at 2.45GHz. The structure, morphology, composition, stoichiometry, chemical bonding and optical properties of the films were investigated by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometry. XRD, FTIR and XPS investigations confirm that both the C.A and M.A films consist of amorphous Al2O3 with a certain amount of chemisorbed oxygen, and both Al2O3 films have a transmittance of at least 92% in the wavelength range of 400–1200nm. However, compared to the C.A film, the M.A films have an even higher transmittance, a wider optical band gap and a lower refractive index.","Hu, Baofu;Yao, Manwen;Xiao, Ruihua;Chen, Jianwen;Yao, Xi",2014-11-30,Ceramics International,"Microwave annealing,Transparent Al2O3 films,Transmittance,Optical band gap,Refractive index",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.05.148,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.05.148
Sintering and mechanical properties of MgO-doped nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite,"Hydroxyapatite (HA) has been extensively studied for its exceptional ability in promoting osseointegration as in bone graft substitute and biomimetic coating of prosthetic implants. However poor mechanical properties of HA, in particular its low fracture toughness, has made its widespread adaption in a number of biomedical applications challenging. Here we employ an optimized wet precipitation method to synthesize nanocrystalline HA with significantly improved mechanical properties. In addition doping by MgO is found to effectively suppress grain growth and enhance fracture toughness by nearly 50% while good densification and phase stability in all samples regardless of concentration of dopant are fully maintained. Microstructural analysis further suggests that the exceptionally superior mechanical properties can be explained by migration of MgO to grain boundaries where they transform the more common transgranular fracture into an intergranular mode. Our biodegradation tests also confirm that MgO-doped HA is indeed a suitable candidate for load bearing implants.","Tan, C.Y.;Yaghoubi, A.;Ramesh, S.;Adzila, S.;Purbolaksono, J.;Hassan, M.A.;Kutty, M.G.",2013-12-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Functionally graded Ti/HAP coatings on Ti–6Al–4V obtained by chemical solution deposition,"Graded Ti100−x /HAP x (x=0 – 100%) films were prepared on Ti–6Al–4V implants by chemical solution deposition using a titanium-isopropoxide chelated by acetylacetone, calcium nitrate and phosphoric acid as starting materials. Ti/HAP solutions with variable HAP contents from 0 to 100% at 10% intervals were spin coated on the substrates and prefired at 500 °C. X-ray diffraction and field emission-scanning electron microscope analysis showed that Ti/HAP coatings were obtained with a dense interface between coating and substrate by final annealing at 500 °C and higher. The effectiveness of the functionally graded HAP/Ti coatings was discussed based on the analysis of the variation of Ca and P contents in simulated body fluid as a function of annealing temperature.","Lim, Yong-Mu;Park, Yeong-Joon;Yun, Yeon-Hum;Hwang, Kyu-Seog",2002-12-31,Ceramics International,"Ti100−x /HAP x,Chemical solution deposition,Simulated body fluid",10.1016/S0272-8842(01)00055-4,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0272-8842(01)00055-4
Brushite ceramic coatings for dental brace brackets fabricated via aerosol deposition,"Biocompatible ceramic coatings were fabricated at room temperature by via aerosol deposition (AD), in order to improve the bonding strength between the dental sapphire bracket and the resin. First, the deposition properties of the brushite films coated on the flat sapphire substrate were investigated, confirming their good deposition rate and appropriate adhesive strength. Then, the mesh and check patterns of the coatings were formed on the sapphire brackets in order to obtain a sufficient shear bond strength. The mesh-pattern grown by converging nozzles exhibited a low film thickness (<10µm) and shear bond strength (<7MPa) due to the sharp triangular-shaped cross sections. In contrast, the check-pattern showed a high film thickness of ~70µm at the same deposition time, as well as a high shear bond strength of ~14MPa, implying that this check-pattern brushite coating formed via the AD process is a promising candidate for application in dental brace brackets.","Lee, Dong-Won;Shin, Min-Chul;Kim, Yong-Nam;Oh, Jong-Min",2017-01-31,Ceramics International,"Aerosol deposition,Bracket,Brushite,Ceramic coating,Shear bond strength",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.037,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.037
High speed and precision grinding of plasma sprayed oxide ceramic coatings,"In this paper, the effects of high speed grinding on six thermally sprayed ceramic coatings were investigated. Grinding was undertaken using four wheel speeds and two work speeds. The responses studied were the following; grinding forces, specific grinding energy, force ratio, surface roughness and surface residual stress. In addition, grinding in traverse mode was also considered in this investigation. An increase in wheel speed resulted in an appreciable reduction in grinding forces. The micro-brittle fracture was the predominant mode of material removal along with micro-cutting in some cases. Further, the surface roughness of traverse ground samples was superior to those obtained using plunge grinding. Finally, it was found that surface residual stresses of samples produced during high-speed grinding are lower than those of samples using precision grinding.","Kar, Simanchal;Bandyopadhyay, P.P.;Paul, S.",2017-12-01,Ceramics International,"Ceramic coating,Plasma spray,High-speed grinding,Traverse grinding,Residual stress",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.071,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.071

The coating microstructure consisted of semi-molten feedstock agglomerates surrounded by fully molten particles that acted as binders. Solid irregular SYSZ granules yielded coatings with lower porosity and thermal insulation capability than the porous spherical YSZ ones.","Loghman-Estarki, Mohammad Reza;Edris, Hossein;razavi, R.

Enhanced ablation resistance through laser glazing of plasma sprayed LaTi2Al9O19-based functionally graded thermal barrier coating,The functionally graded (FG) thermal barrier coating of LaTi2Al9O19 (LTA) and 8% yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) over C263 Nickel alloy was deposited by air plasma spraying and NiCrAlY was used as a bond coat. Plasma sprayed samples were glazed using 3kW CW CO2 laser to produce dense and porous free surface layer to improve coatings ablation resistance. Duplex (DL) LTA/8YSZ coating was also fabricated for comparative studies. The coatings were subjected to hot combustion gas product of hydrogen fuel at a temperature of ~800°C and velocity of Mach 2 (680m/s) to evaluate their ablation behaviour. The phase composition and microstructure of the coatings were characterized by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis. It was observed that the laser glazing significantly reduced the surface roughness and improved the ablation resistance. The duplex layer was found porous and got detached completely because of thermal stress and volume expansion. Spallation of coatings occurred mainly due to shear force associated with hot gas. The laser glazed FG coating exhibited excellent ablation resistance and phase stability. It is concluded that the Laser glazing of FG LTA/YSZ is beneficial for better ablation resistance.,"Dhineshkumar, S.R.;Duraiselvam, Muthukannan;Natarajan, S.;Panwar, S.S.;Jana, Trilochan;Khan, Muhammed Anaz",2016-06-30,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,Functionally graded,Laser glazing,Bond strength,Ablation testing",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.03.134,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.03.134
Effect of pre-oxidation treatment on the bonding strength and thermal shock resistance of SiC coating for C/C–ZrC–SiC composites,"To improve the bonding strength and thermal shock resistance of SiC coating for C/C–ZrC–SiC composites, a transition layer with mechanical interlocking structure was constructed at the interface by pre-oxidation treatment and chemical vapor deposition. For the coated specimens with pre-oxidation treatment at 1073K for 5min, the bonding strength increased from 2.0 to 4.0N, and the mass loss percentage decreased by 52.5% after 12-time thermal cycling between 1773K and room temperature in air. The transition interlocking structure can effectively alleviate the mismatch between the coefficients of thermal expansion of SiC coating and C/C–ZrC–SiC substrate, improving the bonding strength and thermal shock resistance. As the pre-oxidation time increases, a rugged and loose ZrO2–SiO2 layer will be formed at the interface, which is disadvantageous to the bonding strength and thermal shock resistance of SiC coating for C/C–ZrC–SiC composites, and results in the debonding and collapse of the coating.","Zhuang, Lei;Fu, Qian-gang;Zhang, Jia-ping;Guo, Yong-an;Li, He-jun;Shan, Yu-cai",2015-06-30,Ceramics International,"C/C–ZrC–SiC composites,Pre-oxidation treatment,Bonding strength,Thermal shock",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.151,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.151
Thermal cycling and hot corrosion behavior of a novel LaPO4/YSZ double-ceramic-layer thermal barrier coating,"LaPO4 powders were produced by a chemical co-precipitation and calcination method. The ceramic exhibited a monazite structure, kept phase stability at 1400 °C for 100 h, and had low thermal conductivity (~ 1.41 W/m K, 1000 °C). LaPO4/Y2O3 partially stabilized ZrO2 (LaPO4/YSZ) double-ceramic-layer (DCL) thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) were fabricated by air plasma spray. The LaPO4 coating contained many nanozones. Thermal cycling tests indicated that the spallation of LaPO4/YSZ DCL TBCs initially occurred in the LaPO4 coating. The failure mode was similar to those of many newly developed TBCs, probably due to the low toughness of the ceramics. LaPO4/YSZ DCL TBCs were highly resistant to V2O5 corrosion. Exposed to V2O5 at 700–900 °C for 4 h, La(P,V)O4 formed as the corrosion product, which had little detrimental effect on the coating microstructure. At 1000 °C for 4 h, a minor amount of LaVO4 was generated.","Zhang, Chenglong;Fei, Jingming;Guo, Lei;Yu, Jianxing;Zhang, Binbin;Yan, Zheng;Ye, Fuxing",2018-06-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs),Thermal conductivity,Air plasma spraying (APS),Thermal cycling,Hot corrosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.057,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.057
Influence of critical plasma spraying parameter (CPSP) on plasma sprayed Alumina–Titania composite coatings,"Plasma sprayed ceramic coatings are successfully used in many industrial applications, where high wear and corrosion resistance with thermal insulation are required. Critical plasma spraying parameter (CPSP) is a key factor to control the quality of coatings. In this study, Alumina–Titania composite coatings in different compositions (Alumina–3wt.% Titania, Alumina–13wt.% Titania and Alumina–40wt.% Titania) were prepared by 40kW atmospheric plasma spray torch at three different CPSP conditions (833.33, 1000 and 1166.66) and their influence on coatings and plasma jet temperature were studied. The phase, microstructure, sliding and erosive wear rates, microhardness and porosity of the different Alumina–Titania composite coatings was investigated and correlated to CPSP conditions. The result shows that increasing CPSP increases the hardness and anti wear behavior of Alumina–Titania composite coatings except Alumina–40wt% Titania coating.","Yugeswaran, S.;Selvarajan, V.;Vijay, M.;Ananthapadmanabhan, P.V.;Sreekumar, K.P.",2010-01-31,Ceramics International,"B.

A Na and Si co-substituted carbonated hydroxyapatite coating for carbon nanotubes coated carbon/carbon composites,"A Na and Si co-substituted carbonated hydroxyapatite (NaSiCH) coating was applied on carbon nanotubes coated carbon/carbon composites using an ultrasound-assisted electrochemical deposition (UED) method. The morphology and microstructure of the coating were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The in vitro bioactivity of the coating was investigated by examining the ability of apatite formation on its surface in simulated body fluid (SBF). The results showed that the carbon nanotubes coated carbon/carbon composites could provide a porous surface structure for the deposition of NaSiCH. After the UED process, the Na could replace Ca in the structure of hydroxyapatite. The Si could enter into the hydroxyapatite structure in the form of SiO4 4− groups that are combined with the CO3 2− to substitute the PO4 3− groups. The NaSiCH coating was successfully applied on carbon nanotubes coated carbon/carbon composites. The NaSiCH crystals first enwrapped the carbon nanotubes and then infiltrated into the porous structure of the carbon nanotubes. Finally the NaSiCH coating formed a homogeneous coverage, exhibiting a belt shape with a width of 150–350nm and a thickness less than 50nm. The SBF tests showed that the NaSiCH coating could induce the formation of a uniform apatite layer with a wavy shape. In conclusion, NaSiCH offers great potential as a coating material for future medical application.","Leilei, Zhang;Hejun, Li;Kezhi, Li;Qiangang, Fu;Yulei, Zhang;Shoujie, Liu",2014-09-30,Ceramics International,"Carbon/carbon composites,Carbon nanotube,Coating,Hydroxyapatite,Silicon",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.05.015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.05.015
Preparation of interpenetrating alumina–copper composites,"To prepare interpenetrating alumina–copper composites, alumina foams were activated with titanium coating by chemical vapor deposition and then were infiltrated with molten copper by expendable casting process. The microstructure and phase composition of the composites were analyzed, and bending strength, electrical conductivity, friction and wear properties were tested. The results showed that the bonding between ceramic and metal was fine in the composites while no reactions took place between them because of the undissolved titanium coating. With increase of ceramic fraction, the electrical conductivity of the composite decreased, whereas the bending strength increased. The composite failure occurred by ductile fracture of the metal followed by fracture of the ceramic. The wear rate of the composites decreased with increase of ceramic fraction.

Study of the nanoparticle/microparticle powder systems by dry dispersion,"The study of a nanoparticle/microparticle powder systems by dispersion of different type of nanoparticles over microparticles, as support or substrate, has been afforded by a soft mechanical and solvent-less procedure and its effect on the electrostatic charge was studied. The dispersion degree can be evaluated by using diffuse reflectance measurements due to the non-linear change of the reflectance as a function of the nanoparticles amount in the powder composite. The maximum slope variation of the non-linear curve revealed the point where the nanodispersion attained the highest efficiency. The interaction between the OH groups of the dissimilar surfaces provides the anchoring mechanism of the nanoparticles onto the microparticles and the net charge compensation. Furthermore, the dispersed and anchored nanoparticles provide a roughness increasing of the microparticles surface that is responsible for a formation of nanoparticle/microparticle composite powders in which tribo-charge maximized due to the enhancement of composite packaging.","Lorite, I.;Romero, J.J.;Fernandez, J.F.",2013-03-31,Ceramics International,"B.

Thermophysical behavior of thermal sprayed yttria stabilized zirconia based composite coatings,"The effective thermal conductivity of a composite coating depends on intrinsic thermal conductivity of the constituent phases, its characteristics (size, shape) and volume fraction of porosities. The present study concerns studying the effect of CoNiCrAlY and Al2O3 content on the coefficient of thermal expansion and thermal conductivity of the YSZ (YSZ-CoNiCrAlY and YSZ-Al2O3) based composite coatings developed by thermal spray deposition technique. The coefficient of thermal expansion and thermal conductivity of the composite coatings were measured by push rod dilatometer and laser flash techniques, respectively, from room temperature to 1000°C. Variation in density, porosity, coefficient of thermal expansion, and thermal conductivity was observed in the composite coatings with the addition of different volume fraction of CoNiCrAlY and Al2O3 powders in YSZ-CoNiCrAlY and YSZ-Al2O3 composites, respectively. Comparison between the theoretical and experimental thermal conductivities showed a mismatch varying from 4% to 58% for YSZ-CoNiCrAlY composite coatings and from 58% to 80% for YSZ-Al2O3 composite coatings. Model based analyses were used to understand the mechanism of thermal conductivity reduction in the composite coatings. It was concluded that the morphology of porosities varied with composition.","Nath, S.;Manna, I.;Jha, A.K.;Sharma, S.C.;Pratihar, S.K.;Dutta Majumdar, J.",2017-10-01,Ceramics International,"Composite coatings,Yttria stabilized zirconia,Porosity,Coefficient of thermal expansion,Thermal conductivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.170,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.170
Numerical investigation on the effective thermal conductivity of plasma sprayed zirconia coatings,"Due to the complex microstructure of the plasma sprayed yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) coatings, there is still no good numerical method to establish the relationship between the effective thermal conductivity and the microstructure. In this paper, two different approaches have been developed to investigate the effective thermal conductivity of the thermal barrier coatings (TBCs), which are both based on the Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). One approach employs the quartet structure generation set (QSGS) method to construct the isotropic or anisotropic microstructure without experimental techniques. In this method, through changing the parameters of QSGS algorithm, it can estimate the effective thermal conductivity of TBCs fabricated by different plasma spray technologies. The other method is related to the real microstructure of TBCs, which employs the image analysis software to convert the real experimental micrograph obtained using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) into the binary image. Although the first method is more available and practical without analyzing the microstructural image, the second method can estimate the effective thermal conductivity for the plasma sprayed coatings more precisely. However, comparing the predicted results and the experimental data, there are some limitations in both methods. Additionally, the effective thermal conductivity of gradient TBCs is also analyzed in this paper. The results will provide a useful guide for predicting the effective thermal conductivity of plasma sprayed coatings and a strong foundation for designing the gas turbine engines.","Jin, X.Q.;Zhao, C.Y.",2015-12-31,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Plasma spraying,Quartet structure generation set,Lattice Boltzmann Method,Effective thermal conductivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.08.028,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.08.028
"Emission property of Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 nanotubes: Template clamping effect","We investigated the temperature-dependent emission property of ferroelectric Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) nanotubes with variation of the outer diameter from 60nm to 420nm at a fixed wall-thickness (25nm). The PZT nanotubes were synthesized in the sol–gel template directed method with a spin-coating process. While the emission peak positions show a red-shift at lower temperatures commonly for all the nanotubes, interestingly, the temperature dependence of the peak position depends strongly on the nanotube diameter. These results are discussed in terms of the template and geometrical shape effects on the emission property of the PZT nanotubes.","Lee, Yunsang;Kwark, Young-Je;Han, Jin Kyu;Bu, Sang Don",2015-07-31,Ceramics International,"Pb(Zr,Ti)O3,Nanotube,Diameter variation,Temperature dependent photoluminescence",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.03.293,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.03.293
Wet abrasive wear behavior of WC-based cermet coatings prepared by HVOF spraying,"In this study, three kinds of WC-based cermet coatings including WC–CoCr coating, WC–Ni coating and WC–Cr3C2–Ni coating were prepared by the high-velocity oxygen-fuel (HVOF) spraying process. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS) and Vickers hardness tester were used to analyze the microstructure and mechanical properties of these coatings. The WC–CoCr coating presented the highest average microhardness of 1205 HV0.3, and then followed by the WC–Cr3C2–Ni coating (1188 HV0.3) and the WC–Ni coating (1105 HV0.3). The abrasive wear behavior of the WC-based coatings under the conditions of different applied loads and sediment concentrations were studied by a wet sand-rubber wheel tester. The results indicated that the abrasive wear loss rates of all the coatings increased with the increment of applied load or sediment concentration. In addition, the coatings with higher microhardness appeared to have higher abrasive wear resistance. The abrasive wear resistance of the WC-based coatings was 4–90 times higher than that of AISI 304 stainless steel under the same testing condition. The abrasive wear mechanism of the WC-based coatings was deduced to be the extrusion and removal of binder phases, as well as the fragmentation and peel-off of hard phases.","Qiao, Lei;Wu, Yuping;Hong, Sheng;Long, Weiyang;Cheng, Jie",2020-09-02,Ceramics International,"WC-based cermet coatings,Wet abrasive wear,HVOF spraying,Sediment concentration,Applied load",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.009
"Studies on nanotribological and oxidation resistance properties of yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ), alumina (Al2O3) based thin films developed by pulsed laser deposition","The present study aims at a detailed evaluation of mechanical, tribological, and high temperature oxidation resistance (at 1000°C under isothermal condition) properties of YSZ, and Al2O3 based thin films developed by pulsed laser deposition technique. The mechanical and tribological properties of YSZ and Al2O3 thin films showed significant improvement with increasing the deposition temperature during pulsed laser deposition process. The kinetics of oxidation was reduced due to pulsed laser deposition and Al2O3 coating offered a superior oxidation resistance property as compared to YSZ coating. However, the deposition temperature has no significant effect in reducing the TGO growth rate of the pulsed laser deposited thin films.","Nath, Subhasisa;Manna, Indranil;Ray, Samit Kumar;Majumdar, Jyotsna Dutta",2016-05-01,Ceramics International,"Pulsed laser deposition,Young׳s modulus,Hardness,Tribology,Oxidation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.01.094,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.01.094
Electrodeposition of flexible stainless steel mesh supported ZnO nanorod arrays with enhanced photocatalytic performance,"Large scale well oriented ZnO nanorod arrays (ZNRAs) were electrodeposited on flexible stainless steel mesh (SSM) substrate pre-treated by Al doped ZnO (AZO) seed layers. The effects of substrate pre-treatment conditions such as Al doping and spin coating times of the colloid on the morphology characteristics and photocatalytic properties of as-prepared ZNRAs were systematically studied. The results showed that by introducing Al into ZnO colloid solution, well aligned ZNRAs with relatively higher specific surface area (higher growth density and smaller rod diameter) could be obtained on the premodified SSM substrate. In addition, increasing spin coating times of AZO colloid solution would decrease the average diameter of ZNRAs. Under the optimum preparing conditions, the formed flexible SSM supported ZNRAs exihibited enhanced photocatalytic performance of 93.42% and remarkable photocatalytic stability under the UV-lamp for degradation of Rhodamine B.","Wang, Xiaofei;Lu, Hui;Liu, Wenwu;Guo, Min;Zhang, Mei",2017-06-01,Ceramics International,"ZnO nanorod arrays,Electrodeposition,Al-doped ZnO films,Substrate pre-treatment,Photocatalytic degradation,Renewable photocatalytic ability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.02.061,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.02.061
Influence of deposition temperature on the properties of hydroxyapatite obtained by electrochemical assisted deposition,"Surface functionalization of pure titanium (cp-Ti) with hydroxyapatite (HAp) was successfully achieved by means of electrochemical deposition (ED) in a solution containing calcium nitrate and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate. The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of the deposition temperature on the elemental and phase composition, chemical bonds, morphology, and in vitro electrochemical behaviour in biological simulated media (simulated body fluid - SBF). The roughness and wettability of the developed coatings are also investigated. By increasing the deposition temperature from 50°C to 75°C, the HAp coatings present a well-crystalized structure, denser and a nobler behaviour in terms of electrochemical behaviour in SBF at 37°C. Also, by increasing the deposition temperature from 50°C to 75°C, the contact angle has decreased from 76.1° to 27.4°, exhibiting a highly hydrophilic surface. Taking into consideration all the obtained data, electrodeposition of HAp at 75°C was found preferable when compared to 50°C. The characteristics of the HAp coatings can be easily adjusted by optimizing the electrochemical deposition parameters and/or controlling specific features like pH, temperature, or ionic concentration of electrolyte, etc.","Cotrut, Cosmin M.;Vladescu, Alina;Dinu, Mihaela;Vranceanu, Diana M.",2018-01-31,Ceramics International,"A: Chemical preparation,B: Electron microscopy, interfaces, X-ray method,C: Corrosion,D: apatite,E: Biomedical applications",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.227,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.227
Optimization and thermal cycling behavior of La2Ce2O7 thermal barrier coatings,"The La2Ce2O7 (LC) coating with the La/Ce ratio close to 1 was obtained by atmospheric plasma spraying, using La2Ce2.5O8 as a feedstock powder and optimized spray parameters. The spray distance plays a significant role in terms of phase composition, phase stability, as well as porosity of the LC coating, while keeping other spray parameters constant. The plasma-sprayed coatings were prepared and thermally cycled by gas-burner tests to evaluate thermal cycling lifetime. The thermal cycling lifetime of the LC/YSZ double-layer coating was more than three times the lifetime of a single-layer LC coating and comparable to the YSZ coating at operating temperature of ∼1230°C. The thermal cycling lifetimes of the LC/YSZ coating were ∼40% longer at operating temperature of ∼1320°C, but much lower at operating temperature of ∼1350°C compared to the optimized YSZ coating. The failure mechanisms for the LC and LC/YSZ coatings thermally cycled under different conditions were also established in this work.","Dong, Hongying;Wang, Dongxing;Pei, Yanling;Li, Houyang;Li, Peng;Ma, Wen",2013-03-31,Ceramics International,"La2Ce2O7 (LC),Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs),Thermal cycling,Failure mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.08.034,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.08.034
The effect of Eu-loading on the some physical features of CdO,"The Eu-loaded CdO thin films were coated on the glass substrates with a sol-gel spin coating method by using Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O and EuCl3·6H2O salts. The effect of Eu-loading ratio varied from 0 to 4at% in the step of 1at% on the structural, morphological, electrical, and optical features of cadmium oxide had been evaluated with XRD, Raman study, SEM, AFM, Four Point Probe, and UV/VIS analysis. The coated films were polycrystalline with (111) preferential orientation and they had a cubic cadmium oxide structure. The granular-structure was observed from SEM and AFM images. The sizes of granules were in the range of 15–220nm. It was observed that the homogeneity of granule distribution deteriorated with Eu-content. The RMS roughness value increased from 4.1nm to 284nm with Eu-doping. The minimum sheet resistance was found to be 4.8 × 102 Ω for 2at% Eu-content, but the maximum optical band gap was determined to be 2.61eV for 1at% Eu-content. The Urbach energy varied between 366meV and 658meV. As a result of this work, Eu-doping has an important effect on the properties of cadmium oxide.","Turgut, G.;Aksoy, G.;İskenderoğlu, D.;Turgut, U.;Duman, S.",2018-03-31,Ceramics International,"CdO,Sol-gel,Eu-doping",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.183,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.183
Laser cladding assisted by induction heating of Ni–WC composite enhanced by nano-WC and La2O3,"Laser cladding of Ni–WC composites with a high weight fraction of WC results in certain issues, such as cracking susceptibility, non-homogeneity, and WC particle dissolution. In this study, laser cladding of Ni-60%WC using a high-power direct diode laser with and without induction heating was investigated. In addition, the effects of synthesizing a nano-WC powder and rare-earth element (RE) on the quality of Ni–WC coatings were investigated. The effects of utilizing the induction heater on the molten pool evolution were monitored using a pyrometer and an infrared camera. It was observed that laser cladding assisted with an induction heater yielded smooth and homogeneous composite coatings without cracks or porosity. The thermally captured images revealed that the evolution of the molten pool in laser cladding assisted with induction heating was uniform and smooth. The addition of nano-WC particles and La2O3 enhanced the coating homogeneity, microstructure refinement, and coating microhardness correspondingly.","Farahmand, Parisa;Liu, Shuang;Zhang, Zhe;Kovacevic, Radovan",2014-12-31,Ceramics International,"Ni-60%WC composite coating,Laser cladding assisted induction,Crack susceptibility,Nano-WC,Rare-earth elements",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.06.097,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.06.097
Abrasion resistance of ceramic thin films of ZrO2/SiO2 on stretched grade polymethyl methacrylate substrates,"Abrasion resistance of stretched grade polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) was increased by using the sol–gel method to have it coated with a ZrO2/SiO2 thin film. Different molar ratios of Zr(OPr)4/Si(OPr)4 sols were prepared as precursors with propanol. These sols were used for dip-coating the stretched PMMA surfaces to establish very smooth thin films of amorphous Zr–O–Si. Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was employed to study vibrations of Zr–O–Si bonds within the thin film. The phase analysis was undertaken via X-ray Diffraction (XRD) method. The morphology and thickness of coatings on PMMA were investigated by means of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The results showed that coating had an amorphous structure with its thickness within the range of 80–100nm. The water contact angle of PMMA substrates altered from 73° before coating to less than 64° after coating. Once coated, the PMMA substrate had its transparency characteristic (within the UV–vis region) increased. Furthermore, the influences of thermal treatment temperature and molar ratio of precursors (Zr(OPr)4/Si(OPr)4) on abrasion resistance of the coatings were studied.","Mahdavi, Mohammad;Ghiasi, Ahmad",2016-05-01,Ceramics International,"Abrasion resistant,Ceramic thin film,Nanocoating,ZrO2/SiO2,PMMA",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.01.110,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.01.110
Formation and properties of bioactive barium titanate coatings produced by plasma electrolytic oxidation,"In this study, barium titanate (BT) coatings were deposited on a Ti6Al4V alloy by plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) technology. The formation mechanism of the coatings and their wear and corrosion resistances, ferroelectric properties, and bioactivities were examined. The results indicated that during the PEO process, a Ti-O layer was first formed then reacted with Ba(OH)2 electrolyte to induce BaTiO3. The main phase of as-synthesized coatings was identified as tetragonal BT, accounting for the coating ferroelectric character. The BT coatings presented lower friction coefficient, higher wear and corrosion resistance than uncoated Ti alloys. More importantly, the BT coated surface accelerated the formation of apatite layer, essential for binding implant materials to living bone. These findings suggested BT coating as a promising medical biomaterial for bone repair and implants.","Mao, Yifan;Yan, Jiayi;Wang, Linlin;Dong, Weiping;Jia, Yanmin;Hu, Xin;Wang, Xiaoming",2018-08-01,Ceramics International,"Barium titanate,Coating,Plasma electrolytic oxidation,Tribological properties,Corrosion resistance,Bioactivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.115,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.115
Preparation of Ni–W–SiO2 nanocomposite coating and evaluation of its hardness and corrosion resistance,"In this paper, nanocomposite coatings were obtained by electrochemical codeposition of SiO2 nano-particles (diameter 30–40nm) with Ni–W on mild steel surface. The structure and microstructure of coatings was separately analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The corrosion resistance of the samples was evaluated by potentiodynamic polarization (Tafel) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Results indicated that nano-SiO2 had a prodigious impact on the microstructure, composition and structure of electroplated coating by remarkable effect on its electrodeposition process. Ni–W–SiO2 coatings showed higher hardness in comparison with the Ni–W coating. Hardness values of Ni–W–SiO2 coatings ranged from 768 to 823HV and the coating obtained in bath containing 10g/L nano-SiO2 showed a maximum hardness (about 823HV). Apart from that, significant influence had been observed on corrosion resistance by the SiO2 nano-particles. Electrochemical test results demonstrated that Ni–W–SiO2 coatings exhibited a generally less protective performance compared with amorphous Ni–W coating.","Wang, Yi;Zhou, Qiongyu;Li, Ke;Zhong, Qingdong;Bui, Quoc Binh",2015-01-31,Ceramics International,"Ni–W alloy,Electrodeposition,Nanocomposite coating,Nano-SiO2,Microhardness,Corrosion resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.08.034,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.08.034
Microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of in-situ bimodal TiC-Fe coatings prepared by reactive plasma spraying,"An in-situ synthesis phenomenon of bimodal TiC-Fe coatings is discovered in the reactive thermal spraying of Fe-Ti-C composite powders. The Fe-Ti-C composite powders were prepared by a hybrid spray-drying/pyrolysis technology using a mixture of ferrotitanium (TiFe), graphite and sucrose. The microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of the coatings were investigated. The results showed that the TiC-Fe coatings exhibited an apparent bimodal particle size distribution of submicron and nano TiC particles in the α-Fe matrix. The formation of the bimodal distribution structure was revealed as following bi-precipitation mechanism: the first precipitation during the flight process to form submicron TiC particles and the second precipitation in the impact process with rapid cooling to form nano TiC particles. The bimodal TiC-Fe coatings showed high microhardness in various loads due to simultaneous hardening effect from submicron and nano TiC particles. The crack analysis showed that the in-situ bimodal TiC structure hindered the crack initiation and the crack propagation and thus improved the fracture toughness. The bimodal TiC-Fe coatings exhibited high abrasive wear resistance and the wear mechanism transformed from two-body abrasive wear to three-body abrasive wear with the increase of spray distances.","Sun, Xuan;Huang, Jihua;Yang, Jian;Chen, Shuhai",2019-04-01,Ceramics International,"Bimodal,Nano,TiC-Fe,In-situ synthesis,Reactive plasma spraying,Cermet",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.051,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.051
Role of TiO2 nanoparticles in the dry deposition of NiO micro-sized particles at room temperature,"A room-temperature dry-deposition method with TiO2 powder was used to deposit NiO particles onto a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate. Initially, in the absence of TiO2 powder, we observed that the NiO particles did not adhere to the substrate; however, the addition of TiO2 particles facilitated NiO deposition. The volume percentage (vol%) deposition of NiO particles increased with the TiO2 particle concentration. The inability of the NiO particles to adhere to the FTO substrate was attributed to the absence of deformation and fragmentation in the substrate. This is related to the lower hardness of the FTO substrate, compared with that of the NiO particles. However, the addition of the TiO2 particles at different vol% during NiO deposition induced deposition, possibly due to the lower hardness of the TiO2 particles compared with the FTO substrate. The minimum TiO2 fraction that enabled NiO powder deposition was ~4.8vol%. Microstructural analysis revealed that TiO2 powder agglomerates tended to break up as the NiO particles impacted the substrate surface, creating a “deposition complement” from the excess kinetic energy. The deposition mechanism was investigated using microstructural analysis, electron probe microanalysis, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements; the results confirmed the influence of the TiO2 powders on NiO powder deposition, specifically, an improvement in the adhesion and density of the NiO powder and a decrease in the surface roughness of the coating. Therefore, we demonstrated NiO deposition with TiO2 particles at room temperature, providing potential applications to the supercapacitor and battery industries.","Kim, Hyungsub;Yang, Seungkyu;Pawar, Rajendra C.;Ahn, Sung-Hoon;Lee, Caroline Sunyong",2015-05-31,Ceramics International,"D.

Preparation and mechanical properties of alumina composites reinforced with nickel-coated graphene,"This paper discusses the influence of nickel–phosphorus coated graphene (Gn–Ni–P) and uncoated graphene (Gn) addition to an alumina matrix and its impact on the mechanical properties of obtained composites. The composites are prepared via powder processing and consolidated using the Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) method. The effects of the addition of coated graphene and coating thickness on mechanical properties were evaluated. Physical properties such as relative density, hardness and fracture toughness were analyzed.

Hydroxyapatite/hydroxyapatite-magnesium double-layer coatings as potential candidates for surface modification of 316 LVM stainless steel implants,"Various methods are being used for surface modification of orthopedic and dental implants such as deposition of biocompatible coatings on implant surfaces. In this study, hydroxyapatite/hydroxyapatite-Mg double-layer coatings applied on 316 LVM stainless steel are investigated. The applied coatings consist of a dense layer of plasma-sprayed hydroxyapatite and a top layer of cold-sprayed hydroxyapatite-magnesium composite coating (Mg = 10 and 30 wt%). The coated samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) tests. The biological behaviors of the coated samples were evaluated by immersing the samples in a simulated body fluid (SBF) followed by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy, MTT and electrochemical tests. Microstructural studies of the coated samples after corrosion tests showed that the magnesium component of the top layer degraded in SBF solution and formed porosities, which are potential sites for bone tissue growth. Results of ICP spectroscopy analysis indicated that the applied double-layer coating systems prevent the release of toxic elements in the substrate such as nickel. Results of MTT and SBF immersion tests showed that the double-layer coating system improves the biocompatibility and bioactivity of 316 LVM stainless steel.","Rezaei, Alireza;Golenji, Raouf Behjat;Alipour, Fardin;Hadavi, Mohammad Mahdi;Mobasherpour, Iman",2020-11-30,Ceramics International,"Coating,316 LVM Stainless steel,Hydroxyapatite,Magnesium,Biocompatibility",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.005
Seeds-induced synthesis of SiC by microwave heating,"α-SiC particles were used as heating seeds to prepare SiC from coal minerals with microwave heating method. Coating technique was carried out to prepare composite raw powders in three different methods. Heating temperatures were at 1000 °C, 1050 °C, 1100 °C, 1150 °C, 1200 °C for 10min, respectively. XRD, SEM techniques were carried out to characterize samples. It was found that different distribution between C and α-SiC particles from different mixing method leads to different microwave heating behavior and growth mechanisms. V-V reaction leads to in situ nucleation and grain growth on the surface of α-SiC seeds which contact with C particles. Well-grown β-SiC particulates appear. Hybrid V-V reaction V-L reaction lead to local microwave plasma and diffusion-precipitation with a very thin layer of SiO2 between raw C particles and α-SiC seeds. Local fine β-SiC whiskers and particulates on the surface of α-SiC seeds co-exist. Primary V-V reaction leads to nucleation and grain growth along reacted C-SiO2 interface with very thick layer of SiO2 between raw C and α-SiC seeds. Substantial β-SiC whiskers appear. Transformation from β-SiC to α-SiC on the surface of as-formed whiskers will be enhanced by microwave plasma at high temperature.","Wei, Shengnan;Guan, Li;Song, Bozhen;Fan, Bingbing;Zhao, Biao;Zhang, Rui",2019-06-01,Ceramics International,"Microwave heating,SiC,Seeds,Coating,Nucleation and grain growth",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.012
Microstructure and tribological performance of Ni60-based composite coatings on Ti6Al4V alloy with different Ti3SiC2 ceramic additions by laser cladding,"The Ni60-based self-lubricating composite coatings on the surface of Ti6Al4V alloys were successfully fabricated by laser cladding using different Ti3SiC2 ceramic additions. The microstructure, phase compositions and microhardness of the ceramic coatings were analyzed, the dry-sliding tribological properties and corresponding wear mechanisms of Ti6Al4V alloy and these ceramic coatings at different temperatures (RT, 300, and 600 °C) were also investigated systematically. The results show that the coatings are mainly comprised of γ-Ni solid solution, intermetallic compound TixNiy, hard phase TiC, TiB and Ti3SiC2 ceramic phase, the microhardness of the coatings was significantly improved compared with that of the substrate. Due to the synergetic action of the Ti3SiC2 lubricant and hard phase, the composite coatings possess better friction reduction and wear resistance performance than the Ti6Al4V alloys at all test temperatures. The lowest coefficient of friction (COF) (0.30 at 600 °C) was obtained when the composition was Ni60-5% Ti3SiC2(wt%), and the most excellent wear resistance (0.63 × 10−5mm3/Nm at 600 °C) was observed in the coating with composition of Ni60-15% Ti3SiC2(wt%). The abrasive wear, adhesive wear as well as oxidation wear are the main wear mechanisms of the Ti6Al4V alloy at 600 °C, while the coatings (composition: Ni60-10% Ti3SiC2 and Ni60-15% Ti3SiC2) are predominated by hard phase peeling off, three-body abrasive wear and oxidation wear at 600 °C.","Wang, Yang;Liu, Xiu-Bo;Liu, Yi-Fan;Luo, Ying-She;Meng, Yuan",2020-12-15,Ceramics International,"Ti6Al4V alloy,Ti3SiC2 ceramic,Tribological property,Wear mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.071,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.071
Influence of the seed layer on photoactivity inhibition of mica–titania pigments,"The influence of the seed layer on the phase composition and photoactivity inhibition of mica–titania pigments was investigated. The prior deposition of MnO2 or SnO2 as a seed layer resulted in a complete rutile TiO2 coating without calcinations, while the prior deposition of ZnO led to a mixture of anatase and rutile. The rutile promoting effect of MnO2 and SnO2 could be ascribed to the small lattice mismatch (＜5%) between the seed layer and the rutile TiO2. Moreover, the seed layer had a great influence on the photoactivity inhibition of mica–titania pigments. A seed layer of MnO2 inhibited the photoactivity of the pigments, whereas a seed layer of SnO2 or ZnO enhanced the photoactivity of the pigments. The degradation rate constant of mica–MnO2–TiO2 was approximately 72.7% that of mica–TiO2, while the degradation rate constant of mica–SnO2–TiO2 was approximately 4.5 times as high as that of mica–TiO2. The influence of the seed layer on the photoactivity of mica–titania pigments depended on the transfer process of electron–hole pairs between the seed layer and TiO2.","Gao, Qiang;Wu, Xiaomei;Fan, Yueming;Du, Chang",2016-05-01,Ceramics International,"D.

Damage behavior of atomic oxygen on zirconium carbide coating modified carbon/carbon composite,"Zirconium carbide (ZrC) components were induced as coating modification on carbon/carbon (C/C). These ZrC–C/C specimens were investigated after atomic oxygen (AO) exposure for different assessment times, low earth orbit (LEO) ground-based environmental simulator was employed. The results indicate that ZrO2 is the major production generated by the AO chemical reaction with the ZrC coating. Upon further exposure to AO, the production of ZrO2 would drop off, then exfoliate easily, due to the mechanical impacting effect. Then the exposed graphite matrix and carbon fiber get corroded. Amorphous diamond-like carbon (DLC) is detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy during AO exposure. Bending strength performance increased by 25% under AO exposure at first 10 h, then dropped by 52.1% from 10 h to 30 h of AO exposure. The AO damage mechanisms of ZrC–C/C composites are revealed.","Liu, Guanghai;Cheng, Laifei;Li, Kezhi;Chen, Zhaoke;Xiong, Xiang;Luan, Xingang",2020-02-15,Ceramics International,"Atomic oxygen,Coating,Zirconium carbide,Low earth orbit,Exposure,Diamond-like carbon",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.039,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.039
Production of TiO2 coated α-Al2O3 platelets by flame spray pyrolysis and their characterization,"In this study, the applicability of the flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) method in the production of α-Al2O3 based TiO2 coatings was investigated. Plate-like α-Al2O3 particles, with a particle size of 8–30 μm, were dispersed in a solution of titanium tetraisopropoxide-xylene, a low solids suspension was prepared, and then a TiO2 coating was obtained on α-Al2O3 platelets by feeding the precursor suspension into a pre-mixed methane/oxygen flame in a FSP reactor. Obtained coatings were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) methods. While the presence of heterogeneous nucleated TiO2 coating on α-Al2O3 platelet surfaces was revealed by the characterization process performed, it was also observed that homogeneously nucleated TiO2 nanoparticles were obtained during the process.","Kaya, Guray;Gunhan, Busra;Ozer, I.

Microstructure and mechanical property of high velocity oxy-fuel sprayed multimodal WC-Cr3C2–Co–Y2O3 cermet coating,"To investigate the effect of Cr3C2 and Y2O3 additions on cermet coatings, agglomerated and sintered multimodal WC-10Cr3C2–12Co and WC-10Cr3C2–12Co–1Y2O3 cermet powders were deposited as new type of WC-based cermet coatings on plain carbon steel substrate by high velocity oxy-fuel flame spraying. Microstructures, phases, and mechanical properties of both WC-10Cr3C2–12Co and WC-10Cr3C2–12Co–1Y2O3 coatings were examined and compared with those of WC-12Co coating. Results showed that WC-10Cr3C2–12Co and WC-10Cr3C2–12Co–1Y2O3 cermet coatings presented homogeneous microstructures with multimodal carbide particles well distributed in binder matrix, and exhibited phases similar to the feedstock without decomposed phase. However, WC-12Co coating showed the existence of some serious decomposed phases including W2C and amorphous Co3W3C. Morphologies of individual splats on WC-Co substrate clearly demonstrated liquid–solid two phase deposition behaviors of three types of powders in which carbide particles were mainly present in solid state and Co in liquid state. Furthermore, fracture toughness, elastic modulus, and wear resistance of WC-10Cr3C2–12Co and WC-10Cr3C2–12Co–1Y2O3 coatings were found to be higher than those of WC-12Co coating owing to synergistic effects of Cr3C2, Y2O3, and multimodal carbides. Surface morphologies of worn out WC-12Co, WC-10Cr3C2–12Co, and WC-10Cr3C2–12Co–1Y2O3 coatings indicated that wear mechanism mainly included gouging and peeling off.","Yao, Hai-Long;Zhang, Meng-Xian;Yang, Chao;Chen, Qing-Yu;Wang, Hong-Tao;Bai, Xiao-Bo;Ji, Gang-Chang",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"WC-Cr3C2–Co Cermet coating,Y2O3,HVOF,Mechanical property,Microstructure,Phase composition",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.288,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.288
"Fabrication of a leaf-like superhydrophobic CuO coating on 6061Al with good self-cleaning, mechanical and chemical stability","Copper oxide is widely used to obtain superhydrophobic surfaces due to its special micro/nano-structures and properties. However, there are few studies on a leaf-like CuO superhydrophobic coating by direct thermal oxidation of Cu on 6061Al substrate. In this work, there is a simple and low-cost method including chemical replacement, thermal oxidation and low-energy-modification with stearic acid. The resultant coating is superhydrophobic and oleophilic with water contact and sliding angles of 157 . 3 ∘ ± 0 . 5 ∘ and 3 . 6 ∘ ± 1 ∘ , respectively. Additionally, it has low adhesion and excellent self-cleaning performances, whose corresponding mechanical analyses are conducted to theoretically discuss that stable micro/nano-structures and trapped air pockets could effectively influence the interfacial adhesion. Importantly, after tape-peeling, sandpaper-abrasion, and chemical stability tests, the coating still keeps superhydrophobic. Especially, in 3.5 wt% NaCl aqueous solution, compared with the corrosion current density of bare 6061Al substrate ( 7.18 × 10 − 7 A / cm 2 ), that of the SHP CuO coating ( 0.77 × 10 − 7 A / cm 2 ) decreases obviously. In sum, the method is especially suitable for large-scale industrial production of a stable superhydrophobic coating on Al alloys.","Lv, Zhexin;Yu, Sirong;Song, Kaixing;Zhou, Xue;Yin, Xiaoli",2020-07-31,Ceramics International,"Superhydrophobic,Leaf-like,CuO,Thermal oxidation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.013
Preparation of ITO/Ag nanohybrid particles by a reverse micellar layer-by-layer coating,"Silver (Ag) nanoparticles were adsorbed preferentially on indium tin oxide (ITO) surface to form composite particles using a reverse micellar layer-by-layer deposition. The micellar process stabilized the Ag particles by an anionic sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT) surfactant in isooctane solvent. The ITO particles surface was mediated by a cationic poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) polyelectrolyte. The heterogeneous deposition was rendered by both electrostatic attraction and hydrophilic/hydrophobic interaction, and was carried out in multiple coating cycles. The resulting hybrid particles were characterized by zeta-potential measurement, electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry, and inductively coupled plasma analysis, respectively. Optical transmittance of the ITO/Ag composite films was found to decrease substantially with the Ag deposition over the visible wavelengths range, arising mainly from scattering induced by the Ag nanoparticles.","Fan, Jin-Wei;Tseng, Tzu-Tsung;Chen, Chun-Nan;Wei, Ming-Hsiung;Tseng, Wenjea J.",2011-01-31,Ceramics International,"Indium tin oxide,ITO,Silver,Ag,Composite,Micelle",10.1016/j.ceramint.2010.08.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2010.08.006
Formation of dicalcium phosphate dehydrate coating on carbon fibers with in-situ grown graphene nanosheet interlayer,"A dicalcium phosphate dehydrate (DCPD) coating was successfully fabricated on carbon fiber with in-situ grown graphene (IGN) interlayer. The obtained coating was analyzed using XRD, SEM, XPS, Raman, TEM and Thermo-gravimetric analysis(TGA). The in-vitro bioactivity of the obtained coating was investigated by simulated body fluid (SBF) immersion test. The results showed that the IGN interlayer grew homogenously on the carbon fiber with a wavy shape. The IGN interlayer was 40–90nm in length and less than 10nm in thickness. The DCPD exhibited a flake shape with a size of 10–50nm. The IGN could bond with the DCPD tightly and form a uniform distribution within the DCPD coating. TGA test revealed that the carbon fiber with IGN interlayer was more effective for DCPD attachment and deposition than pure carbon fiber. The SBF tests showed that the DCPD coating could induce the formation of a cloud shaped apatite layer. The DCPD coated carbon fiber with IGN interlayer would be possible for potential application in tissue engineering.","Leilei, Zhang;Wei, Li;Hejun, Li;Shoujie, Liu;Shaoxian, Li;Yulei, Zhang",2017-06-01,Ceramics International,"Nanosheet,Graphene,DCPD,Electrodeposition,Carbon fiber",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.01.128,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.01.128
Synthesis of carbon coated Bi2O3 nanocomposite anode for sodium-ion batteries,"Bi2O3 is a promising sodium storage material due to its high gravimetric specific capacity. However, Bi2O3 possesses lower electrochemical performance due to its poor electrical conductivity and structural integrity during Na+ insertion/extraction process. Here, we prepared a carbon coated Bi2O3 nanocomposite by a redox reaction and a carbon coating process. In this nanocomposite, the carbon layer can avoid the direct contact between Bi2O3 and electrolyte, which inhibits the repeated formation and decomposition of solid electrolyte interface film. Additionally, the carbon layer can enhance the electrical conductivity of Bi2O3 and suppress its aggregation due to its volume change during charge and discharge process. In addition, nano-sized Bi2O3 can reduce the transport distance of Na+ and electron. The nanocomposite shows excellent cycling performance and rate capability as anode for sodium-ion batteries. A high capacity of 421 mAh g−1 can be maintained after 100 cycles at 1500mAg−1 and 392 mAh g−1 can be shown at 3200 mAh g−1.","Fang, Wei;Fan, Lishuang;Zhang, Yu;Zhang, Qi;Yin, Yanyou;Zhang, Naiqing;Sun, Kening",2017-08-15,Ceramics International,"Sodium-ion batteries,Anode material,Bi2O3,Carbon coating,Nanocomposite",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.014
Optical and microstructural properties of TiO2(Ni2+) thin films,"Coloured TiO2(Ni2+) thin coatings doped with transitional metals (Ni) were deposited on different substrates (silicon wafers, glass, aluminum) by the sol-gel dip coating process. Complementary techniques (XPS, SE, TEM, XRD, Absorption Spectroscopy) were used to characterize the surface stoichiometry and optical properties, as well as the structure and texture of the thermally treated gels. The presence of fully oxidized film in the outer layers, crystallization in heat treatment to anatase and rutile, formation of porous and coloured films due to the influence of the dopant and the reaction with the substrate, as well as a decrease by three orders of magnitude of the resistivity of Ni-doped films, are reported.","Parlog, C.;Gartner, M.;Osiceanu, P.;Teodorescu, V.;Moise, F.;Ianculescu, A.",1996-12-31,Ceramics International, ,10.1016/0272-8842(95)00062-3,https://doi.org/10.1016/0272-8842(95)00062-3
Multiphase composite Hf0.8Ti0 · 2B2–SiC–Si coating providing oxidation and ablation protection for graphite under different high temperature oxygen-containing environments,"A novel multiphase composite coating composed of Hf0.8Ti0 · 2B2 solid solution, SiC and Si was prepared by a joint procedure of slurry method and silicon reactive infiltration (SRI). The oxidation and ablation experiments were conducted to investigate oxidation and ablation resistance of the Hf0.8Ti0 · 2B2–SiC–Si coated graphite samples, respectively. The results revealed that the coated sample was oxidized at 1823 K for 108 h with a mass gain of 1.49%, which was ascribed to the high viscosity oxide layer improved by HfSiO4 and TiO2 in conjunction with dense structure of the coating, thereby presenting excellent high temperature stability. Furthermore, after 90 s ablation at 3273 K under a heat flux of 5.62 MW/m2, the composite coating was not peeled off, which had mass ablation rate (MAR) and linear ablation rate (LAR) of 3.1 mg/s and 1.5 μm/s, respectively. The refractory oxide layer comprising oxides of Hf and Ti on the surface acted as an oxygen barrier, which can weaken the mechanical erosion force of oxyacetylene flame, finally protecting the inner coating and graphite matrix from further consumption.","Jiang, Yan;Liu, Weilin;Wang, Na;Ru, Hongqiang",2020-09-03,Ceramics International,"Graphite,Hf0.8Ti0 · 2B2 solid Solution,Oxidation,Ablation,Multiphase composite coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.019
Biomimetic apatite deposited on microarc oxidized anatase-based ceramic coating,"Biomimetic apatite was formed on a microarc oxidized (MAO) anatase-based coating containing Ca and P in a simulated body fluid (SBF). At the process of the SBF immersion (0–96h), the Ca and P of the MAO coating dissolve into the SBF, increasing the supersaturation degree near the surface of the MAO coating, which could promote the formation and growth of apatite. After SBF immersion for 7 days, the surface of the MAO coating was modified slightly. The entire surface immersed for 14 days was covered by an apatite coating. The apatite possesses carbonated structure, controllable crystallinity and pore networks. The results indicate that the MAO coating formed in an electrolyte containing phosphate and EDTA–Ca chelate complex possesses good apatite-forming ability.","Wei, Daqing;Zhou, Yu;Jia, Dechang;Wang, Yaming",2008-07-31,Ceramics International,"B.

A facile and scalable coating technique of carbon fibers with carbon nanoparticles for surface adhesion enhancement of fibers and resin in 2D C/C composites,"In order to improve mechanical properties of 2D carbon-carbon composite via increasing fiber/matrix interfacial adhesion, we have developed a simple, low cost and scalable method for carbon fibers (CFs) coating. This method is inspired to ink printing process in which pigments/dyes are transferred and set on the different surfaces via proper chemical bindings. For this purpose, we have used colloidal suspension of carbon nanoparticles in printing ink solution and coated the surfaces through dip-coating procedure. The results of SEM observations showed that colloidal suspension of nano-carbon particles in ink solution could be successfully used as a coating solution for preparing a uniform, well distributed and defect-free coating. Also water wettability measurement test has been conducted in order to evaluate the carbon coating on the surface chemistry of carbon nanofibers. The results revealed significant improvement on wettability of CFs after coating owing to abundant hydrophilic groups introduced from ink solution onto the surface of CFs (approved by FTIR spectroscopy). Finally, the mechanical properties of 2D C/C composites prepared by as-received and nano-coated CFs have been evaluated. The result of mechanical properties showed remarkable improvement in both flexural and shear strength of final composite by 15% and 18%, respectively.","Najafi, Abolhassan",2017-11-30,Ceramics International,"Colloidal suspension,Nanocarbon,Composite,Resin,Coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.087,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.087
Effect of IrO2 crystallinity on electrocatalytic behavior of IrO2–Ta2O5/MWCNT composite as anodes in chlor-alkali membrane cell,"IrO2–Ta2O5 multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composite coatings were synthesized on Ti electrodes at different calcination temperatures from 350 to 550 °C used as anodes in membrane cell for brine electrolysis. The physicochemical properties and electrochemical performance of the coatings were investigated by simultaneous differential scanning calorimetry/thermogravimetric analysis (DSC-TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. Results indicate that the degree of IrO2 crystallinity significantly affects the coating properties. XRD pattern of the coating prepared at 350 °C has shown no reflection peaks indicating that the IrO2 and Ta2O5 were amorphous. The DSC-TGA showed two major exothermic peaks at 475 and 575 °C attributed to the crystallization of IrO2 and oxidation of Ta2O5 from chloride precursor solution, respectively. XPS data reveals the presence of both Ir valance states, which confirms the reversible redox transition of Ir (III)/Ir (IV). The Raman spectra of the coatings demonstrated that the MWCNT gradually loses its tube structure at the calcination temperatures of 450 and 550 °C, and they transform into a graphite-like structure by crystallization of IrO2. However, in the coating without IrO2, the modification of the MWCNT structure was not observed at the calcination temperature of 550 °C. The performance of calcined anodes for brine electrolysis was studied using a membrane cell, which showed that the output current density reduces with increasing calcination temperature. The results of the EIS analysis at oxygen evolution potential showed that the charge transfer resistance of IrO2–Ta2O5-MWCNT composite increases from 1.1 to 18.2 (ꭥ.cm2) due to gradual IrO2 crystallization, which illustrates a sharp reduction in the electrochemical OER activity.","Mehdipour, Mehrad;Tabaian, Seyed Hadi;Firoozi, Sadegh",2019-11-30,Ceramics International,"Dimensionally stable anode,IrO2–Ta2O5,Multi-wall carbon nanotubes,Calcination,Chlor-alkali,Membrane cell",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.255,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.255
CeF3-modified LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode material for high-voltage Li-ion batteries,"A facile chemical deposition method has been adopted to prepare cerium fluoride (CeF3) surface modified LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 as cathode material for lithium-ion batteries. Structure analyses reveal that the surface of LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 particles is uniformly coated by CeF3. Electrochemical tests indicate that the optimal CeF3 content is 1wt%. The 1wt% CeF3-coated LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 can deliver a discharge capacity of 107.1mAhg−1 even at 5C rate, while the pristine does only 57.3mAhg−1. Compared to the pristine, the 1wt% CeF3-coated LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 exhibits the greatly enhanced capacity and cycling stability in the voltage range of 3.0–4.5V, which suggests that the CeF3 coating has the positive effect on the high-voltage application of LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2. According to the analyses from electrochemical impedance spectra, enhanced electrochemical performance is mainly because the stable CeF3 coating layer can prevent the HF-containing electrolyte from continuously attacking the LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode and retard the passivating layer growth on the cathode.","Xie, Y.;Gao, D.;Zhang, L.L.;Chen, J.J.;Cheng, S.;Xiang, H.F.",2016-10-31,Ceramics International,"Lithium-ion batteries,Cathode,Surface coating,High voltage",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.074,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.074
Scheelite coatings on SiC fiber: Effect of coating temperature and atmosphere,"Scheelite coating was deposited on SiC fiber tows from various liquid-phase precursors followed by heat treatments between 900 °C and 1100 °C in different atmospheres. The tensile strength was fully retained for the coated fibers treated at 900 °C in vacuum. Subsequent heat treatment at 1100 °C in Ar had little effect on the fiber strength, which is explained by the excepted good thermal stability between the scheelite coating and SiC fiber. However, larger strength degradation and poor spool ability of coated fibers prepared in Ar/air were found. Assisted oxidation of SiC fiber by calcium salts is suggested to be responsible for the much larger strength degradation of fibers prepared in Ar/air.","Wu, Binbin;Ni, Na;Fan, Xiaohui;Zhao, Xiaofeng;Guo, Fangwei;Ding, Qi;Xiao, Ping",2020-09-01,Ceramics International,"Scheelite coating,SiC fiber,Strength,Different atmosphere,Assisted oxidation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.286,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.286
Thermophysical properties of Yb(Ta x Nb1−x )O4 ceramics with different crystal structures,"Monoclinic (m) and monoclinic-prime (m′) phases of Yb(Ta x Nb1−x )O4 ceramics were synthesized successfully, and the relationships between the crystal structures and the thermophysical properties were investigated by various methods. A ferroelastic domain existed in the m-Yb(Ta x Nb1-x )O4 ceramics, as observed by a scanning electron microscopy, which suggests that a ferroelastic phase transition occurred. The minimum thermal conductivity of the Yb(Ta x Nb1−x )O4 ceramics was 1.49 W m−1·K−1, whereas the maximum thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) was 10.6 × 10−6 K−1 (1200 °C). The m-phase had a lower Young's modulus (110–132 GPa) than the m′-phase (133–140 GPa). In view of the low thermal conductivity and high TEC, Yb(Ta x Nb1−x )O4 ceramics have the potential to be high-temperature structural ceramics.","Yang, Kailong;Chen, Lin;Wu, Fushuo;Zheng, Qi;Li, Jianyu;Song, Peng;Wang, Yanfei;Liu, Rongjun;Feng, Jing",2020-12-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Ceramics,Ferroelasticity,Rare earth tantalate,Thermal conductivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.002
Characterization and corrosion behavior of plasma sprayed calcium silicate reinforced hydroxyapatite composite coatings for medical implant applications,"Titanium and its alloys are widely used for medical implant applications, but their corrosion in the physiological environment leads to the discharge of metal ions, which can trigger severe health issues. In the present study, calcium silicate reinforced hydroxyapatite (HA-CS) coatings were deposited on the Ti6Al4V substrate by using atmospheric plasma spray (APS) process with an aim to improve the corrosion resistance and bioactivity. The coatings were prepared by varying the weight percentage (wt %) of calcium silicate (CS) reinforcement in hydroxyapatite (HA) as Ha/x CS (x = 0, 10, 20 wt %). The SEM analysis of the pure HA coating revealed the presence of surface microcracks, whereas HA-CS coatings displayed the crack-free surface morphology. The corrosion investigation revealed that with the progressive increment of CS content in HA coating, the corrosion resistance of HA-CS coatings improved. In addition, surface roughness, porosity, microhardness and crystallinity increased with the increase of CS content in HA. The findings of this study indicate that the development of plasma sprayed HA-CS coatings is a promising approach to improve the performance of Ti6Al4V alloy for medical implant applications.","Singh, Jarnail;Chatha, Sukhpal Singh;Singh, Hazoor",2020-08-29,Ceramics International,"Plasma spraying,Hydroxyapatite,Calcium silicate,Corrosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.189,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.189
"Effect of arc current on microstructure, texturing and wear behavior of plasma sprayed CaZrO3 coatings","In order to enhance the biocompatibility of metallic implants, various ceramic coatings are currently in vogue. CaZrO3, a promising candidate material, was deposited through plasma spraying on stainless steel (316L) substrates at arc currents of 400, 500 and 600A. The coatings were characterized using a SEM, XRD, surface profilometers and a tribometer. It was found that the arc current had profound effects on the thickness, microstructure, phase evolution, crystallinity and wear behavior of the coatings. The cross-sectional images and fractographic analysis showed that a denser coating with better inter-splat fusion was produced at arc current of 600A. The average roughness (Ra) of the coatings increased from 3.62 to 6.68μm as the arc current was increased from 400 to 600A. The feedstock (powder) and the coatings were predominantly composed of CaZrO3 along with a minor amount of CaZr4O9 phase. The rise in the arc current resulted in a slight increase in the relative proportion of the CaZrO3 phase. Also, the coating produced at arc current of 600A exhibited highest crystallinity. The detailed XRD analysis of (002) and (200) reflections of the ferroelectric CaZrO3 revealed the preferred orientation of crystals in the coatings. The presence of this texture is explained on the basis of shifting the unstable Zr4+ ion in oxygen octahedral cage preferably in one direction. The increase in the arc current decreased the coefficient of friction and, as a result, relatively better wear resistance was observed for the coating produced using higher arc current. Moreover, the coating fabricated using arc current of 600A reduced the volumetric weight loss by 13 times during the wear test as compared to the substrate. Plasma sprayed CaZrO3 coating not only enhanced the wear resistance of the stainless steel but also showed the potential to furnish a bioactive surface.","Khalid, M.;Mujahid, M.;Khan, A.

The effects of solvents on the formation of Ba0.65Sr0.35TiO3 thin films derived by sol–gel processing,"The sol–gel method was used to synthesize Ba0.65Sr0.35TiO3 thin films. Two synthesis routes with two different solvents, ethylene glycol methyl ether and methyl ethyl glycol, were used and compared. Ba0.65Sr0.35TiO3 thin films were deposited on Si substrates by using spin coating technique. The as-deposited dry films were treated with rapid thermal annealing. The effects of solvents on the grain size, morphology, surface roughness, and the phase formation of the Ba0.65Sr0.35TiO3 thin films were studied. Investigation of these films shows that the microstructures of Ba0.65Sr0.35TiO3 thin films prepared from sols using methyl ethyl glycol were more homogeneous and denser; the root mean square (RMS) of the film can reach ∼3nm when annealed at 750°C.","Chen, Xiaoyang;Tian, Yunfei;Liu, Hong;Du, Cenghu;Li, Jun;Yu, Ping",2013-05-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Computer-aided modeling for predicting layer thickness of a duplex treated ceramic coating on tool steels,"Five different tool steels (DIN 1.2080, 1.2210, 1.2344, 1.2510 and 1.3343) have been targeted for a duplex surface treatment consisted of nitriding followed by vanadium thermo-reactive diffusion (TRD). TRD process was performed in molten salt bath at 575, 650 and 725°C for 1 to 15h. A duplex ceramic coating of vanadium carbonitride (VCN) with a thickness up to 10.2μm was formed on tool steel substrates. Characterization of the ceramic coating by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) indicated that the diffused compact and dense layers mainly consisted of V(C,N) and V2(C,N) phases. Layer thickness of duplex coating has been modeled by gene expression programming (GEP). Recently, application of GEP as a computer-aided technique has got appreciable attraction especially for modeling and to formulate engineering demands. For GEP approaches, chemical composition of steel substrates along with different bath and processing parameters totally composed of 17 different parameters were considered as inputs to establish mathematical correlations. Finally, the training and testing results in models have shown strong potential for predicting the layer thickness of duplex treated ceramic coating on tool steels.","Khalaj, Gholamreza;Pouraliakbar, Hesam",2014-05-31,Ceramics International,"Duplex surface treatment,Ceramic coating,Layer thickness,Gene expression programming,Modeling",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.10.141,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.10.141
"Microstructure, formation mechanism and antifouling property of multi-layered Cu-incorporated Al2O3 coating fabricated through plasma electrolytic oxidation","In this work, a Cu-incorporated Al2O3 coating has been successfully produced through the one-step plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) method. Unexpectedly, the resultant Cu-incorporated Al2O3 coating displays a multi-layered structure, which exhibits significant variations in morphology, composition and crystallinity. Compared to the compact outer layer of the PEO coating, both medium and inner layers are highly porous even the average pore size of the medium layer is obviously higher than that of the inner layer. The medium layer has a higher Cu content in comparison to both outer and inner layers. And the outer layer mainly consists of crystalline γ-Al2O3 phase whereas both medium and inner layers are in amorphous states. Further, it was found that Cu specie could exist as Cu2O and CuO in the Cu-incorporated PEO coating. Finally, it was revealed that the incorporation of Cu into the porous PEO coating significantly improves the antifouling property of Al metallic substrate against SRB, which successfully prevents the formation of SRB biofilm. Hence, PEO method is a promising surface modification technique for the fabrication of antifouling coating.","Zhang, Xinxin;Wu, Yule;Wang, Junlei;Xia, Xianchao;Lv, You;Cai, Guangyi;Liu, Hongfang;Xiao, Junyan;Liu, Bing;Dong, Zehua",2020-02-15,Ceramics International,"Plasma electrolytic oxidation,Ceramic coating,SRB,Antifouling",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.284,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.284
"Microstructures, mechanical properties and electrochemical behaviors of nano-structured HA/Ti composite coatings deposited by high-velocity suspension flame spray (HVSFS)","In order to improve the mechanical and electrochemical properties of hydroxyapatite (HA) coating, nanostructured HA/Ti (nHA/Ti) composite coatings with different Ti contents of 30, 50 and 70 wt% were deposited on 316L stainless steel (SS) substrates by high-velocity suspension flame spray (HVSFS) and compared to HVSFS-deposited nanostructured HA (nHA) coatings. Microstructures and phase compositions of as-sprayed coatings were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The deposition mechanism of nanostructured HA/Ti composite coatings was also examined. Microhardness and Young's modulus were measured. Electrochemical corrosion behaviors of all coatings were tested in Hanks’ simulated body fluid using potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Results showed that the nHA/Ti composite coatings contained HA and Ti in addition to some Ti-O compounds. Compared to nHA coatings, nHA/Ti composite coatings presented dense and typical lamella structures formed mostly by flattened splats. Microhardness and Young's modulus of nHA/Ti composite coatings increased with increasing Ti content. Potentiodynamic polarization and EIS measurements illustrated that nHA/Ti composite coatings had excellent corrosion resistance compared to nHA coatings and bare SS substrate.","Yao, Hai-Long;Zou, Yan-Long;Bai, Xiao-Bo;Wang, Hong-Tao;Ji, Gang-Chang;Chen, Qing-Yu",2018-08-01,Ceramics International,"HVSFS,Nano-HA/Ti composite coating,Mechanical property,Electrochemical behavior",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.121,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.121
Synthesis of dandelion-like V2O3/C composite with bicontinuous 3D hierarchical structures as an anode for high performance lithium ion batteries,"The dandelion-like V2O3/C composite was synthesized by a simple and facile template-free solvothermal method followed by a suitable thermal treatment. The dandelion-like V2O3/C composite is constructed by bicontinuous 3D hierarchical structures, which are formed by interconnected nanoparticles and interconnected pores, respectively. Moreover, the surface of interconnected nanoparticles is uniformly coated with an ultrathin carbon layer. Upon evaluation as an anode material for LIBs, the as-synthesized product shows superior electrochemical performance. Under the current density of 0.1 A g−1, the specific discharge capacity of V2O3/C composite is 737 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. Moreover, after 1000 cycles at a high current density of 2 A g−1, the sample exhibits a discharge capacity of 315 mA h g−1 which is 94% of the first-cycle discharge capacity. This excellent electrochemical performance can be ascribed to its unique hierarchical structure with 3D interconnected nanopores and uniform carbon coating.","Xun, Liancai;Gao, Shan;Xu, Yingming;Cheng, Xiaoli;Zhang, Xianfa;Zhao, Hui;Huo, Lihua",2018-08-15,Ceramics International,"Dandelion-like architecture,V2O3/C composite,Solvothermal method,3D interconnected porous structure,Lithium ion battery",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.012
Influence of CoO glass–ceramic coating on the anti-oxidation behavior and thermal shock resistance of 200 stainless steel at elevated temperature,"A CoO glass–ceramic was coated on 200 stainless steel and its thermal shock resistance and anti-oxidation effect were detected at 600–1250°C in ambient air. This coating was prepared by a slurry method and it exhibited fairly good adhesion, oxidation resistance and stability at elevated temperature. Specifically, its thermal shock resistance and anti-oxidation effect were detected. The coating optimized was prepared by a slurry–thermal reaction. Metalloscope, SEM-EDX, and XRD revealed that a stable glass–ceramic layer was formed during the coating process which acted as a perfect film with the thermal cycles and prevented the 200 stainless steel from being oxidized. In the thermal cycle process, the glass–ceramic film was non-stripping with good CTE (coefficient of thermal expansion) match between coating and the steel. This low-cost and facile operating method can be used widely in stainless steel protection at high temperature.","Shan, X.;Wei, L.Q.;Liu, P.;Zhang, X.M.;Tang, W.X.;Qian, P.;He, Y.;Ye, S.F.",2014-09-30,Ceramics International,"C.

Ultralow friction of PVD TiN coating in the presence of glycerol as a green lubricant,"Recently, glycerol has raised great interest among researchers as an environmentally-friendly lubricant. Low friction, even super-lubricity, can be achieved when glycerol is used with diamond-like carbon coatings. Though TiN coatings are currently widely used in improving the tribological performance of forming tools, cutting tools, and machine elements, no literature exists on the tribological performance of a PVD TiN coating under glycerol lubrication. This paper investigates the combination of TiN coatings with glycerol. The results show that glycerol exhibits excellent lubrication performance, which is stronger in the steel/TiN than in the steel/steel tribopair. The action mechanism of glycerol in steel/TiN tribopair is also proposed.","Fu, Xiaojing;Cao, Lei;Qi, Caixia;Wan, Yong;Xu, Chonghai",2020-10-15,Ceramics International,"TiN coatings,Glycerol,Lubrication,Tribofilm",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.211,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.211
Structural evolution of Al-modified PS-PVD 7YSZ TBCs in thermal cycling,"Feather-like columnar 7YSZ thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) were prepared by plasma spray-physical vapor deposition (PS-PVD). In order to improve the thermal cycle performance of TBCs, Al-modification was carried out with the as-sprayed TBCs. Al film was deposited on the surface of TBCs. Subsequently, the Al-deposited TBCs were conducted with vacuum heat treatment. After that, a dense overlay consisting of α-Al2O3, Al3Zr phases was generated on the TBCs surface due to the reactions of Al and O2, Al and ZrO2. The Al-modified TBCs show a better thermal cycle performance than the as-sprayed TBCs because of the overlay generation. Moreover, the structural evolution of overlay was investigated emphatically before and after thermal cycle testing, showing good phase stability. No crack and spallation were observed in the Al-modified TBCs.","Zhang, Xiaofeng;Liu, Min;Li, Hong;Deng, Chunming;Deng, Changguang;Deng, Ziqian;Niu, Shaopeng;Zhou, Kesong",2019-04-15,Ceramics International,"TBCs,PS-PVD,Al-modification,Thermal cycling",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.050,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.050
Modification of electrophoretically deposited nano-hydroxyapatite coatings by wire brushing on Ti–6Al–4V substrates,"In the present study, after successful synthesis of nano-HA powders by chemical precipitation method, wire-brushing (WB) treatment was effectively employed on Ti–6Al–4V substrates for the modification of electrophoretically deposited nano-hydroxyapatite coatings. The precipitated nano-HA particles were characterized by XRD, FT-IR, and DLS analyses. The morphology and particle size of synthesized nano-HA particles was observed by FE-SEM. The Ti–6Al–4V plates were initially wire brushed at different times and rotational speeds. Microhardness profile and AFM analysis of substrates were then studied. It was found that WB treatment at 16,000rpm for 60s leads to a maximum enhancement in the hardness and roughness of surface. Then, the electrophoretic deposition of nano-HA particles was carried out at constant voltage of 30V and after 60s. The results of adhesion test and potentiodynamic polarization measurements showed that WB treatment on Ti–6Al–4V substrates could efficiently increase the bonding strength between coating and substrate as well as corrosion resistance.","Farnoush, Hamidreza;Aghazadeh Mohandesi, Jamshid;Haghshenas Fatmehsari, Davoud;Moztarzadeh, Fathollah",2012-08-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Effects of CMAS penetration on the delamination cracks in EB-PVD thermal barrier coatings with curved interface,"During the high-temperature operation of electron beam physical vapor deposited (EB-PVD) thermal barrier coating (TBC), the penetration of environmental calcium-magnesium-alumina-silicate (CMAS) compositions into the ceramic top-coat would affect the growth of delamination cracks. In this work, the effects of CMAS penetration on the delamination cracks in EB-PVD TBC with curved interface are investigated by finite element analysis. In the numerical model, the curved interface evolves as the cyclic displacement instability of the thermally grown oxide (TGO) layer. The penetration of CMAS into the columnar gaps of EB-PVD TBC mainly increases the in-plane modulus of TC layer. It is demonstrated that, with the increase of in-plane modulus in an intact TC, the level of tensile stress, which mainly occurs in the region above the curved interface and responsible for initiating the delamination cracks, presents a decrease; meanwhile, the level of shear stress, which mainly occurs in the region at the periphery of the curved zone to drive the delamination crack when it propagates into this region, presents a increase. Furthermore, the calculation of the strain energy release rate shows that, for the crack located above the curved interface, the increase of in-plane modulus in TC layer can prevent the accumulation of strain energy release rate, and therefore make it more difficult for delamination initiation. However, once the crack propagates into the flat periphery, CMAS penetration would begin to enhance its growth.","Su, Luochuan;Yi, Chenhong",2017-08-15,Ceramics International,"CMAS penetration,Curved interface,Delamination cracks,Thermal barrier coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.025
Bioinspired multifunctional TiO2 hierarchical micro/nanostructures with tunable improved bone cell growth and inhibited bacteria adhesion,"Two main origins of failure for hard tissue replacements are structural loosening and prosthetic implant infections (PIIs). Bioinspired multifunctional TiO2 hierarchical micro/nanostructures of conical-shaped TiO2 (CTO), regular TiO2 nanotubes (RTO) and irregular TiO2 nanotubes (ITO) with tunable improved cell growth and inhibited bacteria adhesion were synthesized. CTO and ITO samples indicated superhydrophilicity with contact angles of less than 5°. The MTT assay demonstrated excellent biological performance for RTO and CTO sample with 98.1% and 103.1% of cell viability, respectively. The bridging force for osteoblast cell attachment onto the synthesized porous coatings was presented as a possible mechanism. Ultimately, effect of different synthesized surfaces on both Gram-negative, Esherichia coli, and Gram-positive, Staphylococcus aureus, bacteria were estimated. The number of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria per field (NBPF) for RTO were calculated 31 and 42 respectively which were reduced more than approximately 7 and 6 times compared to the calculated NBPF of 222 and 258 for the untreated RT substrate. The recommended approach for bacteria adhesion inhibition without using antibiotics presents an auspicious solution to counteracting bacterial resistance to antibiotics.","Rahnamaee, S.Y.;Bagheri, R.;Vossoughi, M.;Ahmadi Seyedkhani, Sh.;Samadikuchaksaraei, A.",2020-05-31,Ceramics International,"Titanium oxide,Nanotubes,Anodization,Biological properties,Bacterial adhesion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.234,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.234
Micromechanics constitutive modelling and optimization of strain hardening geopolymer composite,"This paper investigates the micromechanics constitutive modelling and optimization of a fiber-reinforced strain-hardening geopolymer composite (SHGC) recently developed by the authors. Micromechanical parameters of the developed fly ash-based SHGC were independently measured or deduced to compute the analytical crack bridging (σ-δ) relation of the composite. The predicted σ-δ relation was compared with the experimental test results. It was confirmed that the previously developed micromechanics-based model can reasonably predict the σ-δ relation of fly ash-based SHGCs. Using the verified model, a parametric study was then performed to evaluate the effects of fiber length, fiber surface oil-coating, and matrix fracture toughness on critical (minimum) fiber content required to exhibit saturated pseudo strain-hardening (PSH) behavior. The results indicated that the critical fiber content in fly ash-based SHGCs is mainly governed by the energy-based criterion. It was demonstrated that the fiber surface oil coating, the increase of fiber length and the reduction of matrix fracture toughness are effective approaches to reduce the critical fiber content. Using the model, it was demonstrated that fly ash-based SHGCs can be systematically optimized by proper tailoring of the material constituents to achieve saturated PSH behavior with the lowest amount of fiber, and thereby the lowest cost.","Nematollahi, Behzad;Qiu, Jishen;Yang, En-Hua;Sanjayan, Jay",2017-06-01,Ceramics International,"Strain hardening geopolymer composite,Geopolymer,Fly ash,PVA fiber,Composite optimization,Micromechanics-based modelling,Fiber-bridging constitutive law",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.01.138,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.01.138
Mechanical properties and thermal stability of tungsten boride films deposited by radio frequency magnetron sputtering,"Tungsten and boron compounds belong to the group of superhard materials since their hardness could exceed 40 GPa. In this study, the properties of the tungsten boride WBx coatings deposited by radio frequency magnetron sputtering were investigated. The sputtering was performed from specially prepared targets that were composed of boron and tungsten mixed in a molar ratio of 2.5 and sintered in Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) process. WB films were deposited on silicon (100) and stainless steel 304 substrates at temperatures of 23 ÷ 770 °C. Microstructure, chemical and phase composition were investigated by using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), respectively. The mechanical properties like Vickers hardness and Young's modulus were obtained by using nanoindentation test at a load of 5 ÷ 100 mN. The friction coefficient and wear resistance of αWB coatings were investigated in scratch test and reciprocal sliding wear instrumentation. Moreover, in order to investigate thermal properties, the αWB films were annealed at 1000 °C in argon/air for 1 h and at 250 °C for 2 h in air atmosphere.

Red–orange to green tunable upconversion emission from HfO2 ceramics embedded in polyester films,"Up-conversion (UC) luminescence in hafnia powder (HfO2) doped with Er3+, Yb3+ and Li+ was studied under continuous wave excitation at 980nm. Powder samples were prepared by the simple evaporation technique and incorporated into polyester films (by spin coating technique). They were characterized using x-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, IR spectroscopy and UV–vis. A study of UC emission from Er3+ ions was performed including the analysis of the spectral and temporal behavior. The effect of Yb3+ co-doping concentration was found to change the intensity ratio of the Er3+ green and red characteristic emissions which allows for a color tuning of the UC emission. The mechanisms contributing to the UC luminescence are discussed as well.","Carmona-Téllez, S.;Mariscal B., L.;Hernández, J.M.;Alarcón-Flores, G.;Medina-Velazquez, D.Y.;Meza-Rocha, A.N.;Murrieta S., H.;Falcony, C.",2015-11-30,Ceramics International,"Hafnia phosphors,Tunable upconversion emission,Polyester films",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.06.062,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.06.062
"Relationship of microstructure, mechanical properties and titanium cutting performance of TiAlN/TiAlSiN composite coated tool","Research on the relationship of microstructure and properties of coated tools such as TiAlN and TiAlSiN plays a key role in obtaining the needed cutting performance in titanium machining. In this study, three kinds of coatings of TiAlN, TiAlSiN monolayer and TiAlN/TiAlSiN composite multilayer have been fabricated by magnetron sputtering method. It is found that the coating structure changes from columnar growth to nanocrystal growth by doping Si element. The TiAlN/TiAlSiN coating is composed by a coarse columnar TiAlN bottom layer and a fine nanocrystalline TiAlSiN top layer. Premature spalling problem (Lc2) is improved by forming the TiAlN/TiAlSiN multilayer structure. Titanium cutting experiment shows that the major wear mechanism of these coated tools is adhesive wear and chipping. The TiAlSiN coated tool has the longest cutting distance at various cutting speeds in these three kinds of coatings. This is because less built-up edge and chipping are generated at the cutting edge due to the dense nanocrystal structure, high hardness and good oxidation resistance of TiAlSiN coating. Therefore, the TiAlSiN coating with dense structure, high hardness and good oxidation resistance is recommended to use in high speed turning titanium.","Sui, Xudong;Li, Guojian;Qin, Xuesi;Yu, Haidong;Zhou, Xiangkui;Wang, Kai;Wang, Qiang",2016-05-01,Ceramics International,"B.

Si nanoparticles encapsulated in CNTs arrays with tubular sandwich structure for high performance Li ion battery,"Silicon has been widely researched as next-generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) anodes on account of its high energy density. To solve the large volume expansion and low electroconductivity, carbon coating Si strategies have been developed and shown some progress. In this study, Si nanoparticles were injected into the inner of the double-deck carbon nanotubes for the formation of a sandwich-like structure to enhance the electrochemical properties of Si electrodes. Thereinto, carbon nanotube arrays (CNTs) were fabricated by liquid paraffin as the carbon resource instead of unsaturated hydrocarbon for the first time by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. Due to the advantage of the specific structure designed, the as-prepared material shows superior rate performance and excellent cycling stability with high capacity retention (1310 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 100 cycles and 1050 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 500 cycles with 98% of Coulombic efficiency).

Facile fabrication of nanotubular heterostructure for enhanced photoelectrochemical performance,"A key challenge in photoelectrochemical water-splitting is the development of photoanodes with improved chemically active and optically efficient. While various nanostructures in heterogeneous materials have been investigated as a potential electrode, existing structures/compositions are still insufficient to meet such demand. Here, we report a scalable strategy to fabricate photoanodes with a nanotubular structure using CdS–TiO2 heterogeneous composite as a model system. Precisely, a ~5 μm thick nanotubular CdS–TiO2 heterostructure is developed on fluorine-doped tin oxide glass by hydrothermal etching and successive ionic layer deposition process. An electron microscopy analysis confirms that the formation of TiO2 nanotubes in the preferential etching direction of [001] as well as uniform coating of the CdS light-absorber layer. We note that the CdS coated on TiO2 nanotubes shows a photocurrent density of 6.9 mA/cm2 at 1.23 VRHE, which is ~2 times higher than that of CdS- nanorod TiO2 heterostructured photoanode. The elemental and optical analysis reveals that the structural modification and sufficient CdS deposition captures a wide range of light absorption from 300 to 550 nm. Our results suggest that an effective fabrication method is applicable for electrodes in numerous energy conversion devices, providing an increase in surface area, light absorption, and chemical stability.","Han, Hyun Soo;Park, Woosung;Sivanantham, Arumugam;Hwang, Sung Won;Surendran, Subramani;Sim, Uk;Cho, In Sun",2020-09-28,Ceramics International,"Photoelectrochemistry,Water oxidation,Solar water splitting,Heterostructure,TiO2,CdS",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.261,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.261
Sol–gel synthesis of Pd doped ZnO nanorods for room temperature hydrogen sensing applications,"A sol–gel spin coating technique was described for the synthesis of Pd doped ZnO nanorods for hydrogen sensing applications. The nanorods were hexagonal in shape, 50–100nm in diameter and uniform in distribution. They exhibited homogeneous surface morphology, c-axis orientation and excellent crystalline properties. The synthesized nanorods were used to sense and detect hydrogen in a homemade gas chamber. The fabricated sensor successfully detected as low as 40ppm hydrogen at room temperature with a very low level of power supply (16.16μA) under a mixed background. Dynamic and repeated responses were observed with a wide range of hydrogen concentrations (40–360ppm) at 200°C. The developed sensor was at least 25 fold more sensitive over the literature documented Pd doped ZnO nanorods in detecting hydrogen at ambient temperature. The simplicity, low-cost, high sensitivity and high stability of the sensor materials suggested that the synthesized Pd doped ZnO nanorods could be used in hydrogen and chemical sensing devices where Pd-mediated catalysis is involved.","Kashif, M.;Ali, M.E.;Ali, Syed M.

Tribological behavior of graphene reinforced chemically bonded ceramic coatings,"To investigate tribological behavior of graphene reinforced chemically bonded ceramic coatings at different temperatures, tribological tests at room temperature, 200 °C and 500 °C were carried out. Results show that the fracture toughness and the hardness of the coating are improved with the introduction of graphene. Besides, the friction coefficient of the coating decreases with the addition of graphene at the room temperature and 200 °C. The coating without graphene achieves the similar friction coefficient at all temperatures. However, the coating with graphene achieves the lowest friction coefficient at 200 °C, and achieves the highest at 500 °C. In addition, the wear rate of the coating decreases with the increase of graphene. Besides, the wear rate at 200 °C is almost similar with that at room temperature. In contrast, the wear rate at 500 °C is much larger than those at room temperature and 200 °C. The mechanisms for graphene to decrease the friction coefficient and improve the wear resistance of chemically bonded ceramic coatings at evaluated temperatures are clarified.","Da, Bian;Rongli, Xu;Yongxin, Guo;Yaxuan, Liu;Aradhyula, Thirumala Vasu;Yongwu, Zhao;Yongguang, Wang",2020-03-31,Ceramics International,"Graphene,Coating,High temperature,Friction coefficient,Wear",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.180,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.180
‎Deposition of Ni-tungsten carbide nanocomposite coating by TIG ‎welding: Characterization and control of microstructure and wear/corrosion responses‎,"In this study, the effect of the amount of tungsten carbide nanoparticles on the wear and corrosion properties of Ni-tungsten carbide nanocomposite coating which is deposited on steel St37 by Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welding was evaluated. For this purpose, surface alloying was firstly conducted on St37 steel by using TIG process with a current of 150 Amps using pure nickel powder and tungsten carbide reinforcement nanoparticles (in 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt%). Then, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), optical microscope, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), microhardness test by Vickers method, abrasion test by sweep method, and electrochemical tests (potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) were used in order to characterize the microstructure and tribological properties of the deposited layers. Microstructural observations showed that the deposited Ni-tungsten carbide nanocomposite coating have a dendritic microstructure with a uniform distribution of tungsten carbide nanoparticles, which reduced the dendritic size by increasing the amount of tungsten carbide nanoparticles. The results of this study showed that by increasing the amount of tungsten carbide nanoparticles in the Ni- tungsten carbide nanocomposite coating, the hardness (from the coating surface to the interface of coating/substrate) and wear resistance increased sharply, but the corrosion resistance decreased. Also, the evaluation of the wear mechanism showed that by increasing the amount of tungsten carbide nanoparticles in Ni-tungsten carbide nanocomposite coatings, the wear mechanism in this coating changed from complex abrasive-sheet like to complex adhesive-oxidation.","Sabzi, Masoud;Dezfuli, Saeid Mersagh;Far, Sadegh Moeini",2018-12-15,Ceramics International,"Tungsten carbide nanoparticles,Ni-tungsten carbide nanocomposite coating,Tribological properties,Surface alloying,Microstructural characterization",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.073,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.073
Characterization of carbon-bonded alumina filters with active or reactive coatings in a steel casting simulator,"Carbon-bonded alumina filter materials—with and without coatings of carbon-bonded MgO and carbon-free Al2O3—were tested in a steel casting simulator in contact with steel melts containing defined endogenous alumina inclusions. For the evaluation of the filtration efficiency of the different filter surfaces, prismatic samples were immersed in the steel melt under an argon atmosphere at 1650°C. The carbon-bonded alumina filter material reacted in situ in the steel melt, forming gaseous alumina sub-oxides. These sub-oxides reacted with the dissolved oxygen of the steel and formed a thin crystalline α-alumina layer on the area in contact with the steel. The secondary alumina layer was formed on the carbon-bonded alumina surface as well as on the alumina-coated carbon-bonded alumina substrate. The newly formed layer reflected the roughness of the substrate, influencing the wettability and, therefore, the deposition behavior of the inclusions on the filter material surfaces tested. Sintered fine endogenous inclusions were identified in various shapes on this thin layer. In the case of carbon-bonded magnesia on a carbon-bonded alumina substrate, carbothermal reduction of the magnesia and subsequent reoxidation to secondary magnesia in the form of a thin layer on the contact area with the steel was observed. Based on the carbothermal reduction of alumina and magnesia, MgAl2O4 spinel whiskers were formed in situ in the hollow filter struts.","Dudczig, S.;Aneziris, C.G.;Emmel, M.;Schmidt, G.;Hubalkova, J.;Berek, H.",2014-12-31,Ceramics International,"C.

"Synthesis, characterization and evaluation of titanium carbonitride surface layers with varying concentrations of carbon and nitrogen",Titanium carbonitride (TiCN) surface layers were grown by direct exposure of Ti to a gas mixture of ammonia and methane at 1050°C. TiC x N1−x coatings with varying C/N ratio were synthesized by appropriately changing the content of methane and ammonia in the reactive gas mixture. The resultant layers were subjected to various characterization and evaluation techniques to study the variation of properties with respect to change in C/N ratio. A systematic change in lattice parameter and microstructure was observed as a function of the composition of active gas mixture. Friction coefficient of TiC was found to be extremely low (0.078). Reaction mechanisms for the growth of TiN and TiC were found to be entirely different. The effect of composition of the gas mixture on growth kinetics of TiCN is elucidated.,"Ajikumar, P.K.;Kamruddin, M.;Kalavathi, S.;Balamurugan, A.K.;Kataria, S.;Shankar, P.;Tyagi, A.K.",2012-04-30,Ceramics International,"Titanium carbonitride,Microhardness,Friction coefficient,XRD,SEM",10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.10.075,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.10.075
Synthesis of high rate performance LiFe1−xMnxPO4/C composites for lithium-ion batteries,"A series of LiFe1−xMnxPO4/C composites (x=0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1) are synthesized via an ion exchange method, utilizing LiOH·H2O, FeSO4·7H2O, MnSO4·H2O, Na3PO4·12H2O, and H3PO4 as the raw materials, citric acid as the carbon source, and reductant, and H2O as the solvent. The composites containing Mn have larger lattice parameters compared to pure LiFeMnPO4/C, due to the larger ionic size of Mn2+ compared to Fe2+. The composites also consist of spherical nanoparticles with a thicker carbon coating. LiFe0.9Mn0.1PO4/C exhibited the best electrochemical properties as the cathode in lithium-ion batteries, with a discharge capacity close to the theoretical value of LiFePO4, better capacity retention rate (98.5% vs. 94.5%) and excellent cycle stability. The improvements were attributed to the Mn-complex. Electrochemical impedance spectra demonstrate that the Mn-composites can improve electronic and ionic conductivity, indicating that introduction of Mn is a viable way to improve the conductivity in olivine-like LiFePO4 cathode materials, and enhance the battery performance.","Ding, Juan;Su, Zhi;Tian, Hualing",2016-08-01,Ceramics International,"Lithium-ion batteries,LiFe1−xMnxPO4/C,Cathode materials,Electrochemical performance,Ion exchange technology",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.184,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.184
The optical waveguide characteristics of highly orientated sol–gel derived polycrystalline ferroelectric PZT thin films,PZT ferroelectric thin films were deposited on various substrates by the sol–gel method. The close relationship between structure and refractive indexes was studied. The optical propagation losses of thin films were measured using the prism-waveguide coupling technique. The optical propagation loss of the films derived on SiO2/Si (111) substrates is increased by increasing the heat treatment temperature. The optical propagation loss is not significantly increased at increased coating thickness. Epitaxial PZT thin films on SrTiO3(l00) single crystal substrate had a single (001) orientation and showed optical propagation loss as small as 14.2 dB/cm at 632 nm.,"Jiwei, Zhai;Xi, Yao;Liangying, Zhang",2001-12-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Characterization and property of bifunctional Zn-incorporated TiO2 micro-arc oxidation coatings: The influence of different Zn sources,"In the present work, Zn-incorporated TiO2 coatings are prepared through a one-step micro-arc oxidation (MAO) method on a grade 4 pure titanium with the addition of either Na2Zn-EDTA solution or ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) as Zn sources. The microstructural features of both Zn-incorporated TiO2 coatings were systematically examined. It is revealed that different Zn sources result in significant difference of phase component, chemical state, composition and morphology between the resultant Zn-incorporated MAO coatings. Zn species could be present as ZnO and Zn(OH)2 in the coating when Na2Zn-EDTA was used as Zn source whereas the presence of ZnO nano-clusters is obvious on the coating surface with ZnO NPs as Zn source. The addition of ZnO NPs during the MAO process also leads to a lower Zn content of the resultant coating, which is more defective with increased thickness in comparison to that of Na2Zn-EDTA. Further, antibacterial property and osteogenic activity of both Zn-incorporated coatings were examined. Both Zn-incorporated coatings exhibit favourable bacterial inhibition ability and bone formability, suggesting the successful synthesis of bifunctional coatings through the facile one-step micro-arc oxidation method.","Zhang, Xinxin;Li, Chenjing;Yu, Yang;Lu, Xueqin;Lv, You;Jiang, Dan;Peng, Zhuo;Zhou, Jin;Zhang, Xiong;Sun, Siqin;Dong, Zehua",2019-11-30,Ceramics International,"Micro-arc oxidation,Titanium,Zn source,Bifunctional coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.228,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.228
Oxidation behavior of magnetron sputtered Mo2N/AlN multilayer coatings during heat treatment,"The Mo2N/AlN multilayer coatings with AlN layer thickness in the range of 0.5nm to 3.7nm were deposited by dc magnetron sputtering. The Mo2N/AlN multilayer coatings exhibited columnar growth structure. As the AlN layers’ thickness exceeds 1.2nm, AlN layers changed from fcc structure to amorphous structure, which breaks off the crystallization integrity of multilayer coatings. The coatings oxidized at 400°C, 550°C, 700°C in air for 1h were investigated by X-ray diffractions (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was found that with the increase of AlN layer thickness, the oxidation resistance of Mo2N/AlN multilayer coatings was improved by reducing the density of columnar grain boundaries and forming dense Al2O3 oxide layer on the surface. The addition of AlN to Mo2N coatings also leads to the lower coefficient of friction (0.36–0.42) of Mo2N/AlN multilayer coatings than that (0.62) of Mo2N coatings.","Wang, Tao;Zhang, Guojun;Liu, Zhuanning;Jiang, Bailing",2015-06-30,Ceramics International,"Mo2N/AlN coatings,Magnetron sputtering,Oxidation behavior,Magnéli phase",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.156,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.156
Cu-doped TiO2 nanoparticles/graphene composites for efficient visible-light photocatalysis,"Cu-doped TiO2/graphene (Cu–TiO2/GR) composites were successfully synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method. The coating of anatase TiO2 nanoparticles on the whole graphene was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) showed that the resulting Cu–TiO2/GR composites exhibited extended light absorption in visible-light region compared with pure TiO2. Photoluminescence emission spectra of Cu–TiO2/GR composites showed better charge separation capability as compared to Cu/TiO2 and pure TiO2. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by degradation of methyl orange (MO) dye under visible-light irradiation. The results demonstrate that Cu–TiO2/GR composite can effectively photodegrade MO, and show an excellent photocatalytic enhancement over pure TiO2. It was concluded that the synergistic effects of the great adsorptivity of dyes, extended light absorption range and efficient charge separation played a significant role for the enhancement of photoactivity of Cu–TiO2/GR composite catalyst.","Khalid, N.R.;Ahmed, E.;Hong, Zhanglian;Ahmad, M.;Zhang, Yuewei;Khalid, Sadia",2013-08-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Synthesis and characterization of LaPO4-coated α-Al2O3 powders,"LaPO4-coated α-Al2O3 powders were successfully synthesized through the heterogeneous precipitation method. The coated powders were characterized by XRD, TEM, EDS, and zeta-potential measurements. According to the XRD results, the coated powders consisted of only α-Al2O3 and monoclinic LaPO4. The TEM examinations and EDS analysis showed that under alkaline condition a homogeneous coating with thickness of ∼10nm was obtained on the α-Al2O3 powder surface. The zeta-potential measurements showed the coated powders to have a pH value of 7.85 at isoelectric point, similar to that of LaPO4 (pH value of 8.21).

A facile in situ surface-coating passivation strategy for improving the moisture resistance of Mn4+-activated fluoride red phosphor,"Mn4+-activated fluorides have become a research hotspot in the community of inorganic red phosphors owing to their fascinating luminescent properties. However, the poor water resistance of these materials severely hinders their application in the fields of wide color gamut (CG) backlight display and warm white solid-state lighting. Herein, we propose a green, facile method, i.e., treatment with oxalic acid (H2C2O4) solution, for constructing a homogeneous Mn4+-rare surface shell layer to improve the water-resistant property of K2GeF6:Mn4+ (KGF) red phosphor. The moisture-resistant property of the treated KGF (T-KGF) phosphor was significantly enhanced; however, no significant change was observed in its luminescent properties. Furthermore, the reasons for the excellent water resistance of T-KGF were investigated in detail, and the formation mechanism of Mn4+-rare surface shell layer was proposed simultaneously. Results indicated that the Mn4+-rare surface shell layer was in situ deposited on the T-KGF core during the solid-liquid equilibrium process. Upon employing the as-treated T-KGF red phosphor, high-performance white light-emitting diode (WLED) with R a of 86.3, correlated color temperature (CCT) of 3824 K, high luminous efficiency (LE) of 152.37 lm/W for WLED2 and an ultrahigh CG (120.1% NTSC standard and 89.7% Rec. 2020 standard) and high LE of 103.12 lm/W for WLED3 were achieved. These results demonstrate that the proposed facile strategy may open a new opportunity to promote the commercialization of Mn4+-activated fluoride phosphors.","Yu, Haojun;Wang, Baochen;Bu, Xiaoya;Liu, Yan-gai;Chen, Jian;Huang, Zhaohui;Fang, Minghao",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"Oxalic acid,Surface-coating passivation,Moisture resistance,Phosphors",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.044,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.044
"Wetting of plasma-sprayed coatings of SrAl2Si2O8 (SrASi), BaAl2Si2O8 (BASi) and Sr4Al6O12SO4 (SAlSr) by Al-12Si alloy","The wettability of SrAl2Si2O8 (SrASi), BaAl2Si2O8 (BASi) and Sr4Al6O12SO4 (SAlSr) plasma-sprayed coatings on mullite substrates by an Al-12Si alloy at 1000°C was studied using the sessile drop technique. All the coatings showed high adherence to the substrate. The SrASi and BASi coatings were mainly amorphous with some monoclinic crystallites of SrAl2Si2O8 and BaAl2Si2O8, respectively. The SAlSr coating was amorphous and contained Sr, Al and O, indicating a decomposition during the coating process. The average contact angles for BASi, SrASi and SAlSr coatings were 121, 122 and 124°, respectively, showing a non-wetting behavior. Coatings of BASi and SAlSr after the wetting experiments presented no reaction with aluminum, while the SrASi coating showed the formation of an alumina layer as a reaction product, indicating a slight reduction of the Sr-celsian by aluminum. In general, these coatings are suitable to enhance the corrosion resistance of aluminosilicate ceramics in contact with Al alloys.","Gamón, E.;Almanza, J.M.;Cortés H, D.A.;Escobedo B, J.C.",2017-04-01,Ceramics International,"Celsians,Strontium sulfoaluminate,Wetting,Plasma-sprayed",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.052,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.052
Methodology for the fabrication of next generation titanium carbide coated C/C composite bipolar plate,"This communication reports the feasibility of the fabrication of next generation ultra light weight (density<0.4g/cm3) and highly conductive bipolar plate using innovative combination of carbon/carbon composite (C/C composite) and conductive ceramic coating. Low density randomly oriented C/C composite was fabricated and the surface of C/C was hermitized and strengthened using a ceramic coating. The titanium carbide (TiC) coating was formed by reaction bonding on the surface of C/C substrate. The conversion of titanium (Ti) element into TiC on the surface of C/C substrate and quality of TiC coating thus formed were investigated through x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), electron dispersive spectroscope (EDS) and argon permeability testing. The result showed that the Ti was completely converted into TiC on the surface of C/C substrate. Further results showed that the coating was very uniform and almost crack free. The coating was found excellent in sealing the porous substrate to a very low permeability.","Raunija, Thakur Sudesh Kumar",2015-06-30,Ceramics International,"Next generation bipolar plate,Low density C/C composite,TiC coating,Hermitization,Permeability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.067,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.067
Improved adhesion and cutting performance of AlTiSiN coatings by tuning substrate bias voltage combined with Ar ion cleaning pre-treatment,"High-energy Ar+ cleaning pre-treatment was used to enhance the adhesion strength of AlTiSiN composite coatings to a cemented carbide substrate. Then, AlTiSiN composite coatings with various substrate bias voltages were deposited. Adhesion, friction, wear and milling performance against DC53 die steel of the AlTiSiN coatings were investigated. Microstructure results showed that AlTiSiN composite coatings were comprised of the columnar AlTiN transition layer and top Nano crystalline AlTiSiN working coating. Surface roughness, friction coefficients and the wear rate of the AlTiSiN coatings decreased with increasing substrate bias voltages. The AlTiSiN coatings deposited at − 80 V showed higher cutting lengths of 27 m, which was ascribed to their high bond strength. These results showed that excellent adhesion strength and cutting performance of coating coated tools could be achieved by tuning the substrate bias voltage combined with high-energy Ar ion cleaning pre-treatment of the substrate.","Cai, Fei;Gao, Ying;Fang, Wei;Mao, Taojie;Zhang, Shihong;Wang, Qimin",2018-10-15,Ceramics International,"AlTiSiN coating,Cutting performance,Wear,Adhesion strength",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.125,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.125
Nacre-like Co–Cr–Mo/Ti2O3 coating on the Co–Cr–Mo substrate prepared using spark plasma sintering,"Despite the common use of Co–Cr–Mo based prostheses in orthopedics, wider medical applications of such implants are often limited by their inherent bioinertness and inadequate adhesion to bone. A bioactive ceramic coating can improve their bonding to bone. In this study, a nacre-like Co–Cr–Mo/Ti2O3 coating on the Co–Cr–Mo substrate was prepared in one single step using spark plasma sintering (SPS). The microstructure, mechanical properties, and biocompatibility of the pellet were extensively studied. The lamellar Co–Cr–Mo and Ti2O3 layers with a thickness of several microns were alternated, resembling the “bricks‐and‐mortar” microstructure of nacre. Co–Cr–Mo consisted of γ phase, ε phase and carbide. The interfacial bonding between Co–Cr–Mo and Ti2O3 was strong, which is essential to achieving high ductility. The incorporation of Ti2O3 to form a composite coating led to improved biocompatibility, with MG63 human osteosarcoma cells cultured on the surface exhibiting faster proliferation and higher viability.","Li, R.T.;Li, Z.;Hu, H.L.;Liu, Z.Q.;Wang, Y.;Khor, K.A.",2020-06-01,Ceramics International,"Composite coating,Sintering,Nacre-like structure,TiO2,Biomedical applications",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.054,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.054
Investigation of phase separation of nano-crystalline anatase from TiO2SiO2 thin film,"In this work, a set of SiO2–TiO2 mixed oxides was prepared by the polymeric sol–gel route and deposited on glass substrate through the dip coating technique. Then, the effect of different important preparation parameters (sol–gel stabilizers, Ti content, and heat treatment) on the phase separation was investigated. The developed films were heat treated at 500°C and characterized using TGA/DTA, FTIR, XRD, SEM, and AFM. The results showed that TiO2 segregation can be controlled by selecting an appropriate composition of diethanolamine (DEA) and methyl methacrylate (MMA) for preparation of polymeric silica–titania sol.

A high oxidation resistance Ti2AlC coating on Zirlo substrates for loss-of-coolant accident conditions,"After Fukushima nuclear accident, the concept of ATFs cladding coating was proposed in order to provide more rescue time under accident conditions. In this work, we fabricated the dense Ti2AlC MAX phase coatings on Zirlo substrate using a hybrid arc/magnetron sputtering technique followed by an annealing treatment. Mechanical properties of the Ti2AlC coating was evaluated, and its oxidation resistance in pure steam conditions was particularly investigated at 1000 °C, 1100 °C and 1200 °C under different oxidation times. The results showed that Ti2AlC coating presents the higher hardness and elastic modulus than substrate, which can effectively improve the mechanical properties of bare Zirlo substrates. The high-temperature oxidation resistance of the Zirlo substrate in pure steam was significantly improved by the coatings with a compact structure and the formed triple scale oxide scale (α-Al2O3+RTiO2/α-Al2O3/TiO2) during oxidation process.

Effect of B4C addition on the oxidation behavior of borosilicate glass repairing coating for C/C brake materials,"The thermal properties of the borosilicate glass repair coating with B4C as a ceramic additive were analyzed, and the changes of thermal expansion, density, and porosity of the glass materials were investigated to characterize the physical characteristics of the repair coating. The results showed that this repair coating displayed variable oxidation resistance and self-healing property at temperatures from 700 to 900 °C, depending on the B4C content. The B2O3 generated from B4C can be dissolved into the borosilicate glass, which could significantly change the coefficient of thermal expansion and the softening temperature of the glass. When B4C content was 25 wt%, the coating with the lowest porosity and oxygen permeability was formed. A model of structure transition of the oxidation-resistant mechanism of the B4C added borosilicate glass coating was discussed.","Deng, Juanli;Hu, Kaiyue;Lu, Baofu;Ma, Xu;Li, Hao;Wang, Jiahao;Fan, Shangwu;Zhang, Litong;Cheng, Laifei",2020-07-31,Ceramics International,"Glass coating,B4C,Oxidation,Self-healing,Repairing coating,Borosilicate glass",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.248,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.248
Distribution of relaxation time in solution-processed polycrystalline CZTS thin films: Study of impedance spectroscopy,"Here we report the complex impedance spectroscopic analysis of polycrystalline CZTS thin films synthesized by sol-gel spin coating technique without any post deposition sulphurization. The films are characterized by microstructural, compositional, optical and electrical studies to confirm the formation of kesterite phase of CZTS comprises of well distributed compact grains with the optical band gap 1.44 eV. Room temperature electrical characterizations of the CZTS thin films by four-probe and Hall effect technique revealed the p-type conductivity of the films with resistivity ~ 1.45 × 10 −2 Ω cm, mobility ~ 3.7 × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 and carrier concentration ~ 1.82 × 1017 cm−3.

"Chemical stability, antibacterial and osteogenic activities study of strontium-silver co-substituted fluorohydroxyapatite nanopillars: A potential multifunctional biological coating","The hydroxyapatite (HA) coating doped with multiple ions has attracted much attention due to its potential to impart various functions (antibacterial and osteogenic activity, etc.) to plastic surgery and dental implants. In this work, novel nano fluorohydroxyapatite (FHA) coatings substituted simultaneously with Sr2+ and Ag+ (SrAgFHA) were designed and successfully synthesized by one-step electrodeposition. Ag was used to impart antibacterial ability to SrAgFHA, and Sr can balance the potential cytotoxicity of Ag, thereby improving the cell compatibility of the composite coating. The SrAgFHA coating was consisted of closely aggregated/fused hexagonal columnar nanorods of ~100–150 nm. The nano-coating has higher corrosion resistance than FHA coating and uncoated Ti. Due to the doping of F, SrAgFHA nanorods have a complete single crystal structure and exhibit low degradability, which can ensure the long-term and slow release of Sr2+ and Ag+ ions. This nanorod coating with a low roughness and zeta potential was superhydrophobic and displayed good in vitro bioactivities, such as excellent apatite forming ability, which proves the osteoconductive nature. The results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy confirmed that by electrodepositing the SrAgFHA coating on the Ti surface, the corrosion resistance was significantly improved. SrAgFHA coating has the best antibacterial effect and osteogenesis ability, for example, the broad-spectrum antibacterial effect on E. coli and S. aureus is 96.5 and 96.8%, respectively, and it can induce osteoblast adhesion, proliferation and differentiation. The rabbit bone defect experiment showed that a large amount of new bone was formed around the SrAgFHA coated implant, and its early bone integration ability was the strongest. In summary, SrAgFHA strikes a balance between superior corrosion resistance, cytocompatibility and excellent antibacterial properties. The multi-element co-doped HA coating has huge clinical application potential in anti-infective repair.","zhang, Xuejiao;Wang, Bingbing;Ma, Lifei;Xie, Lei;Yang, Hao;Li, Yichao;Wang, Saisai;Qiao, Haixia;Lin, He;Lan, Jingpin;Huang, Yong",2020-12-01,Ceramics International,"Fluorhydroxyapatite,Multi-ion doped,Electrochemical,Osteoinductivity,Antibacterial properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.275,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.275

Simultaneous improvements in flexural strength and ductility of carbon nanotube-doped carbon/carbon composites by depositing a pyrocarbon layer on carbon fibers,"Introducing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on carbon fibers (CFs) can significantly improve the matrix-dominated mechanical strength of carbon/carbon composites (C/Cs). As for the CF-dominated mechanical properties such as flexural property, however, the direct introduction of CNTs on CFs always leads to a humble improvement of flexural strength and a brittle fracture mode of the composites. To overcome this limitation, in this work, a thin medium-textured pyrocarbon (PyC) coating, as an interphase layer, was deposited on CFs by isothermal chemical vapor infiltration (ICVI) and its effects on flexural property of CNT-doped C/Cs (CNT-C/Cs) were investigated. Results show that CNT-C/Cs with ICVI PyC layer (PCCT) have a 1100% improvement in flexural ductility and a 44.3% improvement in flexural strength, compared with CNT-C/Cs without ICVI PyC layer (CCT), which are attributed to the toughening role of CFs through their pullouts and the strengthening role of CNTs on the composites. This work could pave a meaningful way for the development of CNT-C/Cs with high mechanical strength and good toughness.","Li, Yun-yu;Guo, Ling-jun;Song, Qiang;Li, Lei;Lu, Jin-hua;Li, Ke-zhi;Zhang, Shou-yang;Li, He-jun",2015-03-31,Ceramics International,"Carbon nanotubes,Carbon–carbon composites,C.

"Effect of doping (Mg,Mn,Zn) on the microstructure and mechanical properties of spark plasma sintered hydroxyapatites synthesized by mechanical alloying","Although hydroxyapatite based bioceramics exhibit excellent bioactivity, their poor mechanical properties limit their applications to primarily as non-load bearing components and surface coating. The current investigation is aimed to mitigate this problem. In the present study, nanocrystalline undoped and 5mol% Mn, Mg and Zn-doped HAp powders are synthesized by mechanical alloying at room temperature. All as-milled samples are subsequently sintered at 950°C using spark plasma sintering (SPS) process to retain the nanocrystalline grains during sintering. Microstructural characterization in terms of lattice imperfections and relative phase abundances in both as-milled and sintered samples are done by analyzing respective XRD patterns employing Rietveld's structure and microstructure refinement method. For all HAp compounds, ~97% of theoretical density has been achieved after powder compaction into pellets by SPS without significant grain growth. Mechanical properties such as, hardness, elastic modulus, fracture toughness and brittleness index of the sintered and polished pellets are measured using Vickers microhardness tester with varying load up to 1kg. Significant improvements in the mechanical properties of doped HAp pellets are noticed with 220% increase in fracture toughness for Mn doped sample.

Densification behavior and ablation property of C/C-ZrC composites prepared by chemical liquid vapor deposition process at temperatures from 800 to 1100 °C,"Chemical liquid vapor deposition (CLVD) process has got much attention because of its high efficiency and flexibility, but almost no reports are available in the fields of C/C-UHTCs preparation and the study of process parameters. In this work, CLVD-processed C/C-ZrC composites were fabricated at temperatures from 800 to 1100 °C, and the effects of temperature on the densification behavior and ablation property were discussed. Results displayed the mass gain, the deposition rate and the density uniformity were enhanced when the temperature increased from 800 to 900 °C, and thereafter they were reduced with the further arising temperature. Meanwhile, there were two different deposition modes due to the various temperatures. When the temperature was 900 °C, the sample possessed a good densification behavior, leading to a high density, great content of ZrC and homogenous distribution. These advantages promote a complete and dense ZrO2 coating on the sample surface during ablation, which plays as an obstacle for oxidizing species diffusion and heat transfer. Thus, the specimen prepared at 900 °C exhibited an outstanding anti-ablation property. However, the densification behavior was deteriorated with the further increasing temperature. Especially, when the temperature increased to 1100 °C, the composites had a poor density, low content of ZrC and bad dispersion of ceramics. As a result, a loose and discontinuous oxide coating was formed on the ablation surface, and the oxidation and mechanical corrosion were severe, suggesting a poor ablation resistance.","He, Qinchuan;Li, Hejun;Wang, Changcong;Chen, Songwei;Lu, Jinhua",2018-05-31,Ceramics International,"C/C-ZrC composites,CLVD process,Densification behavior,Ablation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.239,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.239
Determination of thin film hardness for a film/substrate system,"A simple model for determining the film hardness for the composite hardness of a film/substrate system is developed. On the basis of volume law and current models, the model can be used without requiring any additional material property for amorphous, multicomponent and multiphase coatings. As the cause of indentation size effect (ISE) is taken into account, the ISE of the film is neglected at a high depth/thickness ratio and the introduction of Meyer's equation is avoided. The hardness values of TiC/a-C:H in situ composite films by PECVD are assessed with the model by controlling the film thickness and indenting under fixed loads, the results obtained for the films coated on Si(100) and Corning 7059 are 1479 and 1681 kg/mm2 respectively.","Wang, H.L.;Chiang, M.J.;Hon, M.H.",2001-12-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Influence of powder states on the composition and phase stability of LZ/YSZ composite thermal barrier coatings,"In this study, two kinds of La2Zr2O7/YSZ (LZ/YSZ) composite powders, i.e., composite powders (P1) and mechanically mixed powders (P2), were used to fabricate composite thermal barrier coating samples through supersonic air plasma sprayed technology. The microstructure and composition of as-prepared coatings were closely related to the distribution of LZ and YSZ in the powders. In the coatings fabricated with P1, the majority of LZ were consumed and a new metastable phase (cubic LaYSZ) formed due to the reaction between the molten LZ and YSZ particles during the thermal spraying process. Meanwhile, only a small amount of LZ particles was reserved in the unmelted regions of the coatings. In the coating fabricated with P2, LZ/YSZ composite coatings with random distribution of LZ-splats were successfully achieved and the formation of LaYSZ was suppressed. Because LaYSZ would easily decompose into LZ and YSZ accompanied by a large volume change after annealing at high temperatures, which would lead to the formation of monoclinic phase, the formation of LaYSZ originated from the reaction between the molten LZ and YSZ should be eliminated. In addition, the phenomena of “spot-spallation” could be observed in S1 in the first thermal cycling; whereas, S2 remained intact after 10 thermal cycling tests. These results further verified a better thermal cycling performance of the coating samples prepared by P2. Therefore, the mechanical mixed LZ/YSZ powders were more suitable for preparing LZ/YSZ composite coatings.","Liu, X.Y.;Che, J.W.;Yi, H.;Liang, G.Y.",2018-11-30,Ceramics International,"LZ/YSZ,Composite coatings,SAPS,Metastable phase,Reaction,Phase stability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.015
Oxidation suppression characteristics of the YSZ coating on Mg2Si thermoelectric legs,"Oxide-based coating layers were investigated to suppress the oxidation of an intermediate temperature thermoelectric module that operates in a temperature range of 300–700°C. Four different oxides [alumina (Al2O3), yttria (Y2O3), 8mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia ((Y2O3)0.08(ZrO2)0.92, YSZ), and 20mol% samaria-doped ceria (Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9, SDC)] were coated onto Mg2Si thermoelectric leg surfaces and their anti-oxidation characteristics were compared. While Al2O3, Y2O3, and SDC layers failed to prevent the progression of oxidation of the thermoelectric Mg2Si surface at 700°C, YSZ showed potential as an anti-oxidation coating layer for intermediate temperature thermoelectric modules. The apparent oxidation suppression characteristics of the YSZ layer on the Mg2Si thermoelectric material were studied by a microstructural investigation of the interface between the coated layer and the thermoelectric material. The reliability of the YSZ coating structure was investigated via thermal cycling tests from room temperature to 600°C. The practical adaptability of the YSZ anti-oxidation coating in terms of use for thermoelectric power-generation modules is discussed in detail with the results of variation in contact resistance.","Park, Sang Hyun;Kim, Yeongseon;Yoo, Chung-Yul",2016-06-30,Ceramics International,"Thermoelectric material,Anti-oxidation,Plasma spray,Mg2Si",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.03.161,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.03.161
Optimizing inkjet printing process to fabricate thick ceramic coatings,"This article describes the use of Taguchi optimization and ANOVA techniques on inkjet printing process to determine optimal parameters for fabrication of thick ceramic coatings over glass substrates. Stable nanoparticle suspensions are synthesized through high energy milling of precursor powders with adequate quantities of binder and suspending solvent. Most often, inkjet printing process is being used for developing fine and thin layers (<10µm). However, an attempt is made to fabricate thick ceramic films by varying only IJP process parameters and without multiple layer deposition, thereby reducing efforts in ink synthesis and processing time of coated substrates. Three parameters of IJP were varied for developing a model that was used for precisely predicting the printed layer thickness under varying process parameters. ANOVA technique showed that open time interval in combination with nano particle concentration in the ink could potentially lead to thick coatings. The higher volume % of solvent in the diluted suspension ink under the influence of substrate heating contributed significantly to coffee stain effect with irregular surface coatings. However, increasing the concentration of nanoparticles in the diluted ink resulted in substantial improvement in thickness of the layer with simultaneous control of coating defects.","Rahul, S.H.;Balasubramanian, K.;Venkatesh, Sriram",2017-04-01,Ceramics International,"ZrO2(D),Suspensions (A),Optical Microscopy (B),Surfaces (B),Films (A),Taguchi method",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.103,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.103
Splat formation and microstructure of solution precursor thermal sprayed Nb-doped titanium oxide coatings,"Solution precursor thermal spray can become a breakthrough technology for the deposition of coatings with novel chemistries; however, the understanding of the process that the feedstock material undergoes is still lacking when compared to more traditional presentations (i.e. powder and suspension). In this paper, niobium-doped TiO2 coatings were deposited by solution precursor high velocity oxy-fuel thermal spraying, studying its microstructure and phase. It was reported that a lower flame temperature produced a highly porous coating, while the porosity was reduced at higher flame temperature. Investigation of the phase content showed that, contrary to our current understanding, a higher flame power implied an increase of the anatase phase content for solution precursor spray. Three methods were used: Rietveld refinement, peak height and peak area of the x-ray diffraction patterns. Additionally, single splats were analysed, showing that as the precursor travels through the flame, pyrolysis and sintering takes place to form the solid material. These results were used to derive a model of the physico-chemical transformation of the solution precursor. This work proves that solution precursor thermal spray is a promising technique for the deposition of doped ceramic coatings, being the microstructure and phase content controllable through the spraying parameters.","Tejero-Martin, Daniel;Pala, Zdenek;Rushworth, Simon;Hussain, Tanvir",2020-03-31,Ceramics International,"Solution precursor,HVOF,Niobium,Titanium oxide,Anatase,Single splat",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.253,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.253
Double layer bioglass-silica coatings on 316L stainless steel by sol–gel method,"The application of bioglass coatings on metallic implants provides link between bone and materials and prevents corrosion of metallic implants in body fluid. Therefore, in this research, 45S5 bioglass-silica coatings on 316L stainless steel were prepared by the sol–gel method and were characterized by different techniques. According to X-ray diffraction (XRD) results, by sintering 45S5 bioglass at 600°C for 5h, coatings containing both amorphous phase and Na2Ca2Si3O9 crystalline phase were obtained. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results showed that coatings prepared via appropriate sol aging and substrate preparations are crack-free. Potentiodynamic polarization tests in simulated body fluid (SBF) showed that coatings improve corrosion resistance of substrates, significantly. Further, bioactivity was considered during 30 days of immersion in SBF at 37°C by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), XRD, SEM and potentiodynamic polarization tests that demonstrated the growth of amorphous apatite, hydroxyapatite (HA) and CaSiO3 film on coatings.","Pourhashem, S.;Afshar, A.",2014-01-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Facilely Electrophoretic Derived Aluminum/Zinc (II) Oxide Nanocomposite with superhydrophobicity and thermostability,"Developed energetic composites (e.g. aluminum/zinc (II) oxide) with superhydrophobicity and outstanding thermostability destine to be an attractive new generation of energy materials with wide applications. In this work, the superhydrophobic aluminum/zinc (II) oxide coatings (SAZECs) have been designed by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of components co-scattered in optimal stable suspension of isopropyl alcohol, acetylacetone, and polyethyleneimine as the effect additive, followed by surface energy reducing treatment. Combining energy dispersive X-ray, field emission scanning electron microcopy and X-ray diffraction, we characterized target coatings with relative even distribution and high purity. Wettability analysis results indicated that the SAZECs possessed both high water contact angle (CA) of ~168° and severe exothermic property with heat-release up to 1.88 × 103 J/g. Moreover, product showed excellent water-proof stability and thermostability after twelve months exposure experiments. This work demonstrates fundamental insights for the superhydrophobic energetic materials enabled by rationally designing electrophoretic co-assembly of charged particles, thus possessing universal significance in improving MICs life time while offering a facile reference to design other self-protected MICs for real industrial application.","Guo, Xiaogang;Liang, Taotao;Wang, Jing;Li, Xueming",2020-01-31,Ceramics International,"EPD,Superhydrophobicity,Surface modification,Aluminum/zinc (II) oxide,Thermostability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.071,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.071
Application of zirconia surface coating to improve fracture resistance and stress distribution of zirconia ceramic restorations,"Zirconia ceramic restoration (ZCR) has a higher fracture incidence rate than metal ceramic restoration. Different surface treatments were used to improve fracture performance of ZCR such as grit blasting (GB) by aluminium oxide powder. This type of surface treatment generate residual stresses on veneering ceramic causing crack initiation and ending with a fracture. In order to overcome the stress generated by GB, zirconia surface coating is used as a surface treatment to improve fracture resistance and to accommodate stresses along the ZCR layers. Fifty zirconia ceramic crowns were fabricated and divided according to the type of surface treatment into three groups; the first group is (ZG), involving 20 cores were coated with a mixture of partially-sintered zirconia powder (PZP) and glaze ceramic powder; the second group is (ZL), including of 20 cores were coated with PZP and liner ceramic paste. The third group is grit blasting (GB), preparing of 10 fully sintered cores at 1350 °C which then abraded by 50 µm aluminium oxide powder. The groups ZG and ZL were further subdivided into ZG26, ZG47, ZL26 and ZL47 based on two PZP sizes (47 and 26 µm). Each treated core was veneered with the veneering ceramic layer. Fracture resistance (FR) was measured by the universal testing machine. Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to simulate the stress distributions on the coated and non-coated zirconia crown models. The ZG47 group had higher FR (647.92 ± 97.33 N) and a significant difference (P < 0.00) compared to GB and other coated groups. The FEA exhibited lower and evenly distributed stresses of the zirconia glaze model than the zirconia liner and the non-coated models. The ZG47 coating considered as an alternative method to GB treatment which increases the FR which significantly improved the clinical performance of the ZCR.","Farhan, Firas Abdulameer;Sulaiman, Eshamsul;Kutty, Muralithran G.",2018-12-01,Ceramics International,"Zirconia surface coating,Zirconia ceramic restoration,Fracture resistance,Fractographic analysis, Finite element analysis",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.246,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.246
Appropriate thickness of pyrolytic carbon coating on SiC fiber reinforcement to secure reasonable quasi-ductility on NITE SiC/SiC composites,"Pyrolytic carbon (PyC) coating of silicon carbide (SiC) fibers is an important technology that creates quasi-ductility to SiC/SiC composites. Nano-infiltration and transient eutectic-phase (NITE) process is appealing for the fabrication of SiC/SiC composites for use in high temperature system structures. However, the appropriate conditions for the PyC coating of the composites have not been sufficiently tested. In this research, SiC fibers, with several thick PyC coatings prepared using a chemical vapor infiltration continuous furnace, were used in the fabrication of NITE SiC/SiC composites. Three point bending tests of the composites revealed that the thickness of the PyC coating affected the quasi-ductility of the composites. The composites reinforced by 300 nm thick coated SiC fibers showed a brittle fracture behavior; the composites reinforced 500 and 1200 nm thick PyC coated SiC fibers exhibited a better quasi-ductility. Transmission electron microscope research revealed that the surface of the as-coated PyC coating on a SiC fiber was almost smooth, but the interface between the PyC coating and SiC matrix in a NITE SiC/SiC composite was very rough. The thickness of the PyC coating was considered to be reduced maximum 400 nm during the composite fabrication procedure. The interface was possibly damaged during the composite fabrication procedure, and therefore, the thickness of the PyC coating on the SiC fibers should be thicker than 500 nm to ensure quasi-ductility of the NITE SiC/SiC composites.","Nakazato, Naofumi;Kishimoto, Hirotatsu;Park, Joon-Soo",2018-11-30,Ceramics International,"B.

Microwave-hydrothermal method post-treatment of sprayed Ca-P coating,"Supersonic atmospheric plasma sprayed (SAPS) calcium phosphate (Ca-P) coating is post-processed by microwave-hydrothermal (MH) method for the reduction of the surface defects in our previous work. During the MH process, ethylenediaminetetraacetic disodium salt (Na2EDTA) as complexing agent is added during the MH reaction, while controlling the pH values, to achieve the purpose of grain refinement and decrease the surface defects, and enhance the corrosion resistance of the sprayed Ca-P coating. Afterward, surface morphologies, element and phase composition of the coating, chemical groups, surface roughness, porosity, bioactivity and corrosion resistance are all studied. The results show that the addition of Na2EDTA and the adjustment of pH value during MH treatment do have a positive effect on grain refinement, and improvement the bioactivity and corrosion resistance of the sprayed Ca-P coating. Expressly, their corresponding corrosion potential are − 0.1105 ± 0.0025, − 0.1072 ± 0.0012 and − 0.3021 ± 0.0021 V according to the corrosion current density 2.19 × 10−6, 1.89 × 10−5and 1.71 × 10−5 A/cm2, respectively.","Su, Yangyang;Li, Kezhi;Zhu, Xiaofei;Wang, Changcong;Zhang, Yunpeng",2019-01-31,Ceramics International,"Supersonic atmospheric plasma spray,Calcium phosphate coating,Microwave-hydrothermal,Ethylenediaminetetraacetic disodium salt,Grain refinement",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.258,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.258
Three-dimensional (3D) LiMn0.8Fe0.2PO4 nanoflowers assembled from interconnected nanoflakes as cathode materials for lithium ion batteries,"Three-dimensional (3D) olivine LiMn0.8Fe0.2PO4 nanoflowers constructed by two-dimensional (2D) nanoflakes have been successfully synthesized through an easy liquid phase method.

Interface modification of carbon fibers with TiC/Ti2AlC coating and its effect on the tensile strength,"A uniform TiC/Ti2AlC gradient coating was obtained on carbon fibers via an in-situ reaction in molten salts. The results indicated that in-situ growth of TiC/Ti2AlC coating caused strong interfacial bonding and surface defects. In this case, evident stress concentration was induced and cracks penetrated the fiber easily during tensile loading. Thus the tensile strength of carbon fibers was dramatically decreased to 78 ± 13 MPa. In order to improve the performance of the as-prepared TiC/Ti2AlC-coated carbon fibers, a pyrolytic carbon layer was pre-fabricated on carbon fibers. By introducing pyrolytic carbon layer, the interfacial bonding strength and surface defects were reduced accordingly. These improvements lead to a decrease of stress concentration and cracks propagation, and facilitate the interfacial debonding during tensile loading. As a result, the tensile strength of the fiber was significantly increased to 550 ± 72 MPa. This fact indicates that pre-fabricating a pyrolytic carbon layer on carbon fibers is an effective method to improve the reliability of the TiC/Ti2AlC-coated carbon fibers. The present work also provides a feasible way to fabricate TiC/Ti2AlC interphase for high-performance Cf/SiC composites.","Wang, Kai;Li, Mian;Liang, Yanqin;Wang, Jie;He, Liu;Du, Shiyu;Huang, Zhengren;Huang, Qing",2019-03-31,Ceramics International,"Carbon fibers,Interface,Tensile strength,Pyrolytic carbon,MAX phases",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.156,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.156
Wear performance of SiC/G coating at elevated temperatures,"To improve the wear performance of SiC materials, a SiC/graphite (SiC/G) coating was prepared by CVD. Wear tests were conducted at elevated temperatures, and related microstructure and mechanical characteristics were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and micro-hardness tester. The results show that the SiC/G coating has excellent anti-wear performance with low friction coefficient at RT owing to the lubrication of graphite. Moreover, the friction coefficient of the SiC/G coating is lower than that of the uncoated SiC samples at all tested temperatures. As the temperature rose to 250°C, the wear mechanism of SiC/G coating was shifted to severe adhesive wear, which resulted in an increase in friction coefficient. However, fracture and oxidation dominated the friction process of SiC/G at 500°C, which caused an increase in wear volume. In addition, the formation of silica debris was conductive to the decrease of friction coefficient.","Zhang, Jumei;Wang, Zhihu;Niu, Libin;Sun, Wanchang",2014-01-31,Ceramics International,"D.

Fabrication and characterization of porous biphasic β-tricalcium phosphate/carbonate apatite alginate coated scaffolds,"In this research, biphasic β-tricalcium phosphate/carbonate apatite (β-TCP/CO3Ap) scaffolds incorporated with alginate were fabricated. Sodium alginate was extracted from local brown seaweed, Sargassum polycystum via calcium alginate process. Biphasic β-TCP/CO3Ap scaffolds were fabricated by polymer reticulate method. β-TCP slurry was infiltrated into the polyurethane foam (PU) foam, then sintered up to 1300 °C, soaked for 4 h and immediately quenched in still air to form biphasic β-TCP/α-TCP scaffold. Biphasic β-TCP/α-TCP scaffold was then transformed to biphasic β-TCP/CO3Ap scaffold by dissolution-precipitation reaction with 1 M of NaHCO3 at 170 °C for 1, 3 and 5 days. Biphasic β-TCP/CO3Ap scaffold from 5 days dissolution-precipitation reaction was chosen to incorporate with 1%, 3% and 5% of sodium alginate, respectively, as it has the highest composition of CO3Ap phase. FTIR and FESEM analysis confirmed the presence of characteristic functional groups of sodium alginate. Mechanical strength of biphasic β-TCP/CO3Ap scaffold improved by increasing the concentration of sodium alginate. The highest mechanical strength achieved was 26.38 kPa for biphasic β-TCP/CO3Ap scaffold with 5% sodium alginate coating and it was chosen to further study with the addition of 1%, 3% and 5% microspheres.

Characterization and ablation resistance of ZrB2-xSiC gradient coatings deposited with HPPS,"To improve the oxidation protection of carbon fiber-reinforced carbon (C/C) composites, a four-layer ZrB2-xSiC gradient coating was designed and deposited on a C/C substrate by high-power plasma spraying (HPPS). The phases and microstructures of the spray powders and gradient coating were characterized. The results showed that as the SiC content increased, the molar ratio of ZrB2 to SiC approached the eutectic point gradually, more eutectic structures can be produced in the spray powders; thus, the porosity of the gradient coating decrease accordingly from the outer to the inner layer. The anti-ablation property of the ZrB2-xSiC gradient coating and ZrB2-50 vol% SiC (Z5S5) and ZrB2-20 vol% SiC (Z8S2) single-component coatings were investigated by the oxyacetylene flame (OAF) test. The mass ablation rate of the ZrB2-xSiC gradient coating surged from 1.63 × 10-4 to 2.46 × 10-3 g/s because the evaporation speed of the ablative product (SiO2) increased rapidly as the ablation temperature increased from 1900 °C to 2200 °C, respectively. Compared with those of the Z5S5 and Z8S2 coatings, the gradient coating had a better ablation resistance owing to the formation of a dense ZrO2 top-layer structure and decreased thermal stresses.","Bai, Yixin;Wang, Quansheng;Ma, Zhuang;Liu, Yanbo;Chen, Haikun;Ma, Kangzhi;Sun, Shijie",2020-07-31,Ceramics International,"ZrB2-SiC,Gradient coating,High-power plasma spraying,Oxyacetylene flame test,Anti-ablation property",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.280,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.280
Pelletisation by tumbling as an alternative method of agglomerating nanometric particles for use as feedstock in bi-modal structured flame-sprayed ceramic coatings,"This paper is focused on the physical evaluation of ceramic granules of Al2O3, Al2O3-13 wt% TiO2 (AT-13) and TiO2 obtained from alumina and titania nanoparticles by pelletisation in a rotating drum. The results were compared with those of both sintered and non-sintered granules of similar chemical compositions and particle size distributions which were spray dried, as well as with those of TiO2 pelletised granules blended with atomised alumina particles. The results obtained indicated that the physical characteristics of the pelletised granules conferred them a free-flowing behavior which was similar to that of the spray-dried granules. However, the TiO2 pelletised granules blended with harder atomised alumina particles disintegrated and, therefore, exhibited a poor flowability. Additionally, it was evident that the ceramic coatings fabricated from pelletised granules displayed a structure which was as or more compact than those of the granules obtained from agglomerated powders by spray drying with or without sintering, apart from being more compact than that of the coatings deposited from TiO2 pelletised granules blended with atomised alumina particles. The above findings indicate that the alternative pelletising method is potentially useful for the use of agglomerated nanoparticles as feedstock in the fabrication of bi-modal structured flame-sprayed ceramic coatings.","Árias, Jhoman Alberto;Hurtado, Francy Milena;Vargas, Freddy;Estrada, Geraldine;Cadavid, Edwin;Rincón Ortiz, Mauricio;Palacio, Claudia Constanza;Vargas, Fabio",2019-11-30,Ceramics International,"Pelletisation,Nanoparticles,Thermally sprayed coatings,Bi-modal structure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.083,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.083
Hydrothermally grown uniform TiO2 coatings on ZrO2 fibers and their infrared reflective and thermal conductive properties,"Improving the infrared reflectivity of ZrO2 polycrystalline fibers is of great benefit to its thermal applications. In the present research, we cast a highly uniform TiO2 coating with a thickness ranging from dozens to hundreds of nanometers on ZrO2 fibers by utilizing hydrothermal growth. The coating bonds tightly to the ZrO2 fibers via Zr–O–Ti chemical linkages, and the thickness of the coating can be tailored by varying the hydrothermal growth time. The TiO2 coating, acting as a sheath towards electromagnetic radiation, not only reflected light with wavelengths ranging from the visible region to the infrared region and up to 8 μm but also shielded the Raman signals of the ZrO2 fibers. The present research provides an efficient way to cast controllable and uniform coatings on flexible fiber materials. The obtained ZrO2 fibers coated with TiO2 may have applications such as reinforcement for bulk ceramics, thermal barrier coatings, aerogels, etc., thus performing the dual functions of mechanical strengthening and thermal insulation.","Ma, Dehua;Zhu, Luyi;Liu, Benxue",2020-02-15,Ceramics International,"Infrared reflection,Thermal properties,TiO2,ZrO2 fibers,Hydrothermal growth",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.050,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.050
"Structure, mechanical properties and thermal stability of Ti1-xSixN coatings","Ti1-xSixN coating is a promising candidate for wear resistant applications due to their super-hardness and high thermal stability. Here, we explored the structure, mechanical properties and thermal stability of Ti1-xSixN (x = 0, 0.13, 0.17 and 0.22) coatings deposited by cathodic arc evaporation. Monolithically grown Si-containing Ti1-xSixN coatings, which are Si-solution in TiN for x = 0.13 and 0.17, reveal a high hardness of 39.4 ± 0.67 and 40.6 ± 0.72 GPa, respectively. Then Ti1-xSixN transforms into a nanocomposite structure consisting of cubic Ti(Si)N nanocrystallite enveloped by the amorphous SiNx tissue phase for x = 0.22, which exhibits a high hardness of 40.0 ± 0.6 GPa. However, increasing of Si content leads to a significant increase in compressive stress from −0.63 GPa for x = 0 to −3.78 GPa for x = 0.13 to −4.54 GPa for x = 0.17 to −5.51 GPa for x = 0.22. The hardness of Ti1-xSixN coatings can be maintained up to ~ 1000 °C due to the suppressed grain growth, and then decreases for further elevated annealing temperature, whereas the TiN coating exhibits a continuous drop in hardness towards its intrinsic value of ~ 21.3 GPa.","Pei, Fei;Xu, Yu X.;Chen, Li;Du, Yong;Zou, Hou K.",2018-09-30,Ceramics International,"Ti1-xSixN coatings,Nanocomposite structure,Hardness,Thermal stability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.210,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.210
Cracking induced tribological behavior changes for the HVOF WC-12Co cermet coatings,"HVOF sprayed WC based cermet coatings have been widely used in industries as barriers against wear and hydrodynamic cavitation due to their high hardness and relatively high toughness. However, cracking of the coatings can occur during coating production or in service, which can reduce operational performances. It can be difficult to assess the performance impact due to cracks within the coating and as to whether the cracked coatings should be resprayed or removed from service. In this work, artificial cracks of different widths were introduced to liquid fuel HVOF sprayed WC-12Co coating through uniaxial tension of the coated steel substrate to assess the implications of such cracking. Tribological performances of the cracked coatings were examined using rubber wheel dry abrasion, ‘ball on disc’ sliding wear, and ultrasonic cavitation erosion. The results show that the crack deteriorates the abrasive wear resistance of the coating at the initial stage due to preferable mass loss at the cracks. However, after 30 min of abrasion, all the cracked coatings showed the same wear rate as compared to the non-cracked coating, with the abrasive wear resistance acting independent to the crack characteristics. Because the cracks could store wear debris and thus minimize the debris induced abrasion to the coating surface during sliding wear test, both improvement in wear resistance and reduction in coefficient of friction (COF) were detected in the cracked coatings. During the cavitation test, it was found that the mass loss of the specimen increased significantly (up to 75%)with crack width and density suggesting that the crack presence greatly deteriorated the cavitation resistance of the cermet coatings.","Luo, Xiao-Tao;Smith, Gregory M.;Wang, Yan;Gildersleeve, Edward;Sampath, Sanjay;Li, Chang-Jiu",2019-03-31,Ceramics International,"WC-Co cermet,Cracked coating,Abrasion wear,Sliding wear,Ultrasonic cavitation erosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.164,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.164
A novel thermal barrier coating for high-temperature applications,"A new thermal barrier coating system based on La1.7Dy0.3Zr2O7 (LDZ), which had a lower thermal conductivity for applications above 1773K, was prepared by the air plasma spraying (APS). The phase composition, thermal expansion coefficient, thermal conductivity, the actual heat insulation and antioxidant ablation of the as-sprayed coatings were investigated. XRD results reveal that single pyrochlore phase LDZ coating is prepared and no new phase appears after ablation at 1573K and 1773K. Compared to 8wt% yttria partially stabilized zirconia (YSZ) coatings, LDZ has better phase stability, lower thermal conductivity, better actual heat insulation, antioxidant ablation and heat resistance performance. These results imply that the LDZ ceramics can be explored as candidate material for the ceramic layer in TBC system.","Wang, Xueying;Guo, Shengnan;Zhao, Lili;Zhu, Yongping;Ai, Li",2016-02-01,Ceramics International,"C.

Microstructure and piezoelectric properties of thermal sprayed Bi0.5(Na0.70K0.20Li0.10)0.5TiO3 ceramic coatings,"The microstructure of Bi0.5(Na0.70K0.20Li0.10)0.5TiO3 (BNKLT) coatings fabricated by thermal spray method was closely examined by TEM, revealing the coexistence of rhombohedral and tetragonal perovskite main phases, and very minor secondary phases, while all amorphous phase was crystallized after heat treatment. Obtaining coexisting rhombohedral and tetragonal perovskite phases after the thermal spray process involving the melting-recrystallization and heat treatment process resulted in piezoelectric ceramic coating with excellent electrical and electromechanical properties.

Electrophoretic deposition of chitosan/Bioglass® and chitosan/Bioglass®/TiO2 composite coatings for bioimplants,"Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method has been developed for the fabrication of chitosan/Bioglass® and chitosan/Bioglass®/TiO2 composite coatings on stainless steel substrates for biomedical applications. Microstructure, thickness, and mechanical properties, such as Vickers microhardness, compressive strength, and elastic modulus were determined. The use of chitosan enabled the co-EPD of Bioglass® and TiO2 particles and offered the advantage of room temperature processing typical of EPD. The coating composition was varied by the combination of Bioglass® and TiO2 concentrations in the chitosan solutions used for EPD. The cathodic deposition yield was studied at constant voltage for various deposition times. The coatings were microstructurally characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy(EDS). Homogeneous chitosan/Bioglass® coatings on stainless steel substrates were obtained at constant voltage condition using aqueous suspensions based on 0.016wt% chitosan and 2wt% Bioglass®. The addition of TiO2 nanopowder to the composite coating was confirmed to improve the hardness, Young's modulus and compressive strength of the base chitosan/Bioglass® coating.","Clavijo, Silvia;Membrives, Francisco;Quiroga, Gisela;Boccaccini, Aldo R.;Santillán, María J.",2016-09-30,Ceramics International,"Chitosan,Bioglass®,Composite coatings,Electrophoretic deposition,Titania,Mechanical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.178,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.178
Preparation and characterization of SrLi2Ti6O14@C/Ag as lithium storage anode material for rechargeable batteries,"In this work, silver and carbon co-coated SrLi2Ti6O14 is synthesized by using a solid-state assisted solution method, with glucose as carbon source and silver nitrate as Ag source. The structural and morphological properties of as-prepared samples are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which confirm that C/Ag composite layer is uniformly coated on the surface of SrLi2Ti6O14. Electrochemical measurements like galvanostatic charge/discharge tests, rate performance, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis are also undertaken to evaluate and compare the lithium storage capability of SrLi2Ti6O14 before and after coating. According to the results, SrLi2Ti6O14@C/Ag presents enhanced electrochemical capability compared with bare material. It can be found that bare SrLi2Ti6O14 only delivers the reversible capacity of 140.32mAhg−1 with capacity retention of 90.7% at 100mAg−1 after 200 cycles. In contrast, SrLi2Ti6O14@C/Ag presents the reversible capacity of 151.20mAhg−1 with only 6.7% capacity loss after 200 cycles. The improvement is owing to the increase of electronic conductivity and the decrease in the redox polarization after coating. In order to further investigate the structural stability of SrLi2Ti6O14@C/Ag, in-situ XRD was performed as well. All the results prove that the C/Ag co-coating has positive effect on the electrochemical performance of SrLi2Ti6O14.","Wu, Yaoyao;Qian, Shangshu;Lan, Hua;Yan, Lei;Yu, Haoxiang;Cheng, Xing;Ran, Fanmin;Shui, Miao;Shu, Jie",2017-06-15,Ceramics International,"SrLi2Ti6O14,C/Ag coating,Anode material,Lithium rechargeable batteries",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.013
Characterization of a duplex precursor-derived and pyrocarbon coating for needled carbon fiber felts,"A polycarbosilane (PCS) blended with tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) in xylene solvent was used as a precursor for developing anti-oxidation coatings on a needle-punched carbon fiber felt with pyrolytic carbon deposition. Elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TG) were employed to characterize curing products of the precursor. The converted ceramic products of the precursor under Ar flow and in vacuum to a maximum temperature of 1000°C and 1200°C, respectively, were investigated by FT-IR, X-ray diffraction (XRD), TG and transmission electron microscope (TEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). All pyrolysis products were found to contain β-SiC and amorphous SiO2 with more acute β-SiC XRD peaks obtained for the higher pyrolysis temperature. Two representative TEM regions were shown to have different empirical chemical compositions. Needled carbon fiber felts with a pyrolytic carbon inner deposition layer impregnated in the precursors were cured in air and then pyrolyzed at high temperatures to form duplex SiC-based outer coating layers. Comparative study of a series of processing conditions through scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation indicated that, carbon fiber preforms, which were coated by using the 10% PCS and 5wt% TEOS precursor in xylene and repeating the impregnation–pyrolysis cycle twice, witnessed relatively complete coverage of the coating in the thickness range of 35–120nm with a small amount of pyrolysis product lumping.","Zhang, Haiyan;Wang, Shuangshuang;Liu, Yufu",2014-05-31,Ceramics International,"Carbon fiber,Coating,Ceramic precursor,Pyrolysis,Characterization",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.11.087,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.11.087
Inverse precipitation synthesis of ZrO2 nanopowder and in-situ coating on MWCNTs,"ZrO2-multiwall carbon nanotubes composite was successfully prepared by simple inverse precipitation method. The effects of initial ZrOCl2·H2O concentration (0.5 and 1 g) and stirring speeds (400, 800 and 1200 rpm) on the phase formation, texture, surface characterization and microstructural evolutions were studied. Results from XRD showed that almost all of the synthesis ZrO2 exists in tetragonal phase; however, depending on ZrOCl2·8H2O concentration and stirring speed, some peaks of monoclinic phase existed in the composites. Texture studies illustrated the (111) plane preferred growth for tetragonal phases. The FTIR results confirmed the formation of different oxide groups in the surface of the CNTs. In addition, formation of the tetragonal ZrO2 on the surface of CNTs was proved by Raman spectroscopic analyses. The results from microscopic images showed that the size of the ZrO2 nanoparticles significantly decreased (30 nm) with an increase in the initial ZrOCl2·8H2O concentration to 1 g.","Ghahfarokhi, Shadab Sarmast;Mamoory, Rasoul Sarraf;Kalashami, Ali Ghatei",2018-08-15,Ceramics International,"CNTs/ZrO2,Nanocomposite,Precipitation,Raman,Inverse,Texture",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.188,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.188
The corrosion and bioactivity behavior of SiC doped hydroxyapatite for dental applications,"Hydroxyapatite (HAP) coatings are commonly used to improve the bioactivity of Ti alloy used for orthopedic or dental implants. Recently, in order to decrease the dissolution rate and to improve the mechanical and anticorrosive properties, as well as the osseointegration of the HAP coated titanium alloy, the addition of different elements (Si or Ti) into HAP films was proposed. The goal of this work was to enhance the bioactivity and corrosion resistance of HAP films by SiC addition. The coatings were deposited on Ti6Al4V alloy substrates by co-sputtering of HAP and SiC targets in a magnetron sputtering system. The films were characterized in terms of elemental composition, morphology and corrosion resistance in artificial saliva by EDS, SEM, and electrochemical techniques, respectively. The coatings were proposed to be used in dental applications. For this reason, in vitro bioactivity was investigated after 24h immersion in artificial saliva. The improvement of the bioactivity and corrosion behavior was demonstrated for HAP coatings enriched with SiC.","Azem, Funda Ak;Kiss, Adrian;Birlik, Isil;Braic, Viorel;Luculescu, Catalin;Vladescu, Alina",2014-12-31,Ceramics International,"B.

Effect of Y2O3 on the oxidation properties of ZrSi2/SiC coating prepared by SAPS on the carbon-carbon composites,"In order to improve the oxidation resistance of carbon-carbon (C/C) composites at high temperature, different content of Y2O3 modified ZrSi2/SiC coating for C/C composites were prepared by pack cementation and supersonic atmosphere plasma spraying (SAPS). Microstructure observation and phase identification of the coatings were analyzed by SEM, XRD, DSC/TG and EDS. Experimental results shown that the coating with 10 wt% Y2O3 effectively protected C/C composites from oxidation at 1500 °C in air for 301 h with a mass loss of 0.13% and experienced 18 thermal shock times from room temperature (RT) to 1500 °C. First, Y2O3 could restrain the phase transition of ZrO2 to reduce the formation of thermal stresses of the coating; second, the random distribution of ZrO2 ceramic particles and the formation of ZrSiO4 enhanced the stability of the SiO2; third, the formation of Y2Si2O7 and Y2SiO5 could relieve the thermal mismatch between ZrSi2-Y2O3 outer layer and the inner layer.","Liu, Fei;Li, Hejun;Gu, Shengyue;Yao, Xiyuan;Fu, Qiangang",2018-09-30,Ceramics International,"Oxidation resistance,C/C composites,Y2O3,ZrSi2/SiC coating,SAPS",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.138,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.138
Structure and tribocorrosion properties of duplex treatment coatings of TiSiCN/nitride on Ti6Al4V alloy,"To meet the performance requirements in harsh marine service environment, developing coatings with excellent trbibocorrosion performance is necessary. Herein, TiSiCN/nitride duplex treatment coatings are prepared by gas nitriding and multi-arc ion plating in turn in this work. The hardness and density are enhanced by nitriding treatment. Duplex treatment coatings exhibit more excellent mechanical properties possessing the maximum hardness values (33 GPa) and exceptional load bearing capacity (88 N) compared to TiSiCN coating. Meanwhile, the effect of wear on corrosion is significant and the action of corrosion determines the total degree of synergy in tribocorrosion system. Furthermore, the friction coefficient is greatly reduced through duplex treatment coatings during tribocorrosion test due to the good resistance to the seawater and the graphitization effect produced by TiSiCN layer.","Dong, Minpeng;Zhu, Yebiao;Wang, Chunting;Shan, Lei;Li, Jinlong",2019-06-15,Ceramics International,"Gas nitriding,Duplex treatment,Tribocorrosion,Graphitization",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.180,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.180
Boehmite coating on θ-Al2O3 particles via a sol–gel route,"θ-Al2O3 powders in slurry form were coated by boehmite nanoparticles prepared from alumina sol that consists of aluminum tri-sec-butoxide (Al(OC4H9)3) as a precursor. The θ-Al2O3 powders presented an iso-electrical point (IEP) at pH∼9.2, and formed stable suspensions without notable gravity settling at acidic conditions (pH 3–4). Boehmite nanoparticles with a mean particle size ca. 68nm were derived from the hydrolysis of Al(OC4H9)3 sol. Well-dispersed boehmite/θ-Al2O3 aqueous mixtures consisting of 3 and 9wt.% of boehmite were then prepared by addition of θ-Al2O3 powder into the Al(OC4H9)3 sol followed then by vigorous agitation at 90°C and in a pH range 3–4. IR and particle-size measurement both revealed possible coating of boehmite on the θ-Al2O3 particles. From TEM observation, “thickness” of the boehmite layer did not vary much with the boehmite concentration. Agglomeration of the particles became nonetheless apparent as the boehmite concentration was increased. The boehmite coating on θ-Al2O3 surface inhibited grain growth during the θ- to α-phase transformation upon heating. Mean grain size of the boehmite-coated alumina was substantially smaller than that of the un-coated one.","Cheng, Lung-Teng;Tsai, Mong-Yen;Tseng, Wenjea J.;Hsiang, Hsing-I.;Yen, Fu-Su",2008-03-31,Ceramics International,"Boehmite,Alumina,Coating,Zeta potential",10.1016/j.ceramint.2006.10.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2006.10.005
Two-step modification process to improve mechanical properties and bioactivity of hydroxyfluorapatite scaffolds,"Porous ceramic scaffolds are synthetic implants, which support cell migration and establish sufficient extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell-cell interactions to heal bone defects. Hydroxyapatite (HA) scaffolds is one of the most suitable synthetic scaffolds for hard tissue replacement due to their bioactivity, biocompatibility and biomimetic features. However, the major disadvantages of HA is poor mechanical properties as well as low degradability rate and apatite formation ability. In this study, we developed a new method to improve the bioactivity, biodegradability and mechanical properties of natural hydroxyfluorapatite (HFA) by applying two-step coating process including ceramic and polymer coats. The structure, morphology and bioactivity potential of the modified and unmodified nanocomposite scaffolds were evaluated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The scaffold with optimized mechanical properties was HFA-30 wt%HT (HT stands for hardystonite) with a total porosity and pore size of 89 ± 1 and 900–1000 µm, respectively. The compressive modulus and strength of HFA (porosity ~ 93 ± 1) were improved from 108.81 ± 11.12–251.45 ± 12.2 MPa and 0.46 ± 0.1–1.7 ± 0.3 MPa in HFA-30 wt%HT sample, respectively. After applying poly(ε-caprolactone fumarate) (PCLF) polymer coating, the compressive strength and modules increased to 2.8 ± 0.15 and 426.1 ± 15.14 MPa, respectively. The apatite formation ability of scaffolds was investigated using simulated body fluid (SBF). The results showed that applying the hardystonite coating improve the apatite formation ability; however, the release of ions increased the pH. Whereas, modified scaffolds with PCLF could control the release of ions and improve the apatite formation ability as well.","Sadeghzade, Sorour;Emadi, Rahmatollah;Soleimani, Batol;Tavangarian, Fariborz",2018-11-30,Ceramics International,"A.

Inorganic ceramic fiber separator for electrochemical and safety performance improvement of lithium-ion batteries,"A separator based on ceramic fibers with excellent properties, utilized for powerful laminated lithium ion batteries, was prepared by low-cost production process. Physical and chemical characteristics of the separator and the electrochemical as well as the safety performance of lithium ion batteries were extensively investigated, and compared to commercialized polyethylene (PE) and ceramic-coating PE (C-PE) separators. The results demonstrated that inorganic ceramic fiber (CF) membrane exhibited higher porosity (85%), higher electrolyte uptake (381%) and higher ionic conductivity (1.48mS/cm). Moreover, CF separator did not display thermal shrinkage at 160°C for 1h, manifesting that the separator possession of high thermal stability. The lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2/ graphite battery employing the CF membrane displayed superior rate capability, which delivered the discharge capacities of 13.206Ah (0.2C), 12.729Ah (0.5C), and 12.074Ah (1C), respectively. In addition, this battery improved cycle stability, with the capacity retention of 101.4% following 100 cycles at 1C rate. Results of safety tests presented that batteries with CF separator passed both nail penetration and extrusion tests, implying that the safety performance was remarkably improved. Additionally, CF membrane had only 20 cents in cost for 1 Ah cells, which was ten times lower than commercial PE and C-PE separators. The perfect combination of good properties and low cost made it possible for the CF separator to be a promising separator for laminated lithium-ion batteries, which are especially used in electric vehicles.","Zhao, Xinxin;Zhang, Zonglin;Yang, Sisi;Liang, Guangchuan",2017-12-01,Ceramics International,"Lithium-ion battery,Inorganic ceramic fiber,Separator,Safety performance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.219,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.219
Solid-state synthesis of mullite from spent catalysts for manufacturing refractory brick coatings,"This paper shows the results of the solid-state synthesis of mullite from spent catalysts discarded from fluid catalytic cracking (FCC); the catalysts are mainly composed of silica and alumina but are polluted with SOX, forming a non-crystalline network. The synthesized mullite was used as a feedstock to thermally spray a coating onto a silica-alumina refractory brick, and its chemical resistance at high temperature was subsequently evaluated by contact with K2CO3 at 950°C. Initially, the spent catalyst was thermally treated for 2h at 600, 900, and 1200°C to eliminate the SOX pollutant. The heat treatment at 1200°C completely removed the SOX in the sample. Additionally, four thermal processes were performed by heating the spent FCC catalyst in an electrical furnace to 1500 and 1600°C and by using an oxyacetylene flame to synthesize mullite. Thermal treatments at 1500°C were performed with and without alumina added to the spent FCC catalyst, whereas those conducted at 1600°C and using a flame were performed using only added alumina. In the powders thermally treated at 1500°C, silica-rich mullite (3Al2O3.2SiO2) accompanied by an excess of alumina or silica was obtained with or without alumina added, respectively. In contrast, the materials treated at 1600°C formed alumina-rich mullite (2Al2O3.SiO2), which was accompanied by an excess of alumina. Mullite was not synthesized in the flame-heated powder. The silica-rich mullite accompanied by an excess of alumina was used as feedstock powder to modify the surface of a refractory brick, improving its resistance to chemical attack by K2CO3 at high temperature.","Vargas, Fabio;Restrepo, Edward;Rodríguez, Jhon E.;Vargas, Freddy;Arbeláez, Lizeth;Caballero, Pablo;Arias, Jhoman;López, Esperanza;Latorre, Guillermo;Duarte, Gloria",2018-03-31,Ceramics International,"Mullite synthesis,Waste catalyst,Ceramic coating,High-temperature chemical resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.044,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.044
Uniform coating of TiO2 nanoparticles using biotemplates for photocatalytic wastewater treatment,"Immobilization of TiO2 particles over substrates like glass can facilitate the separation after photocatalytic runs. Photocatalytic activity of TiO2 coatings is related to its morphology, crystallography, optical properties and adherence of the coating. Biotemplates, including animal-based and herbal-based templates are inexpensive, biocompatible and abundant and can control the quality of TiO2 coating. In this study the effects of biotemplates such as agar, gelatin, and starch on the physiochemical properties of TiO2 coatings were investigated. Synthesized coatings were characterized by XRD, BET, FESEM, TEM, FTIR, EDX, and UV-Vis DRS analyses. The results showed that using biotemplates reduces the TiO2 crystallite size. Template-free TiO2 had 30 nm crystallite size, but using templates like agar decreased the size to 18 nm. Moreover, the addition of biotemplates decreased the thickness of TiO2 coatings compared to template free coating. And the use of biotemplates also limits the pore size distribution and increases BET surface area. According to EDX, TiO2 coating with agar indicated a uniform Ti distribution and crack-free homogenous morphology. TEM analysis of agar-templated TiO2 film showed a uniform morphology of TiO2 particles with average particle size of 20 nm. The UV-Vis DRS also confirmed a reduction in the band gap of TiO2 after the introduction of biotemplates. The study of the photocatalytic performance of samples showed that agar-templated TiO2 coating was able to remove 62.4% of methylene blue, while the coatings synthesized with gelatin and starch were just able to remove 42.77% and 35%, respectively. The TiO2 coating with agar was studied at different pH values and different initial methylene blue concentrations as well. The stability test of agar-templated TiO2 coating after four runs indicated just 5% of activity lost.","Najafidoust, Ahmad;Allahyari, Somaiyeh;Rahemi, Nader;Tasbihi, Minoo",2020-03-31,Ceramics International,"TiO2,Coating,Sol-gel dip-coating,Biotemplate,Photocatalyst",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.202,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.202
A MoSi2-SiOC-Si3N4/SiC anti-oxidation coating for C/C composites prepared at relatively low temperature,"In this study, SiC coating for C/C composites was prepared by pack cementation method at 1773K, and MoSi2-SiOC-Si3N4 as an outer coating was successfully fabricated on the SiC coated samples by slurry method at 1273K. The microstructure and phase composition of the coatings were analyzed. Results showed that a porous β-SiC inner coating and a crack-free MoSi2-SiOC-Si3N4 coating are formed. Effect of Si3N4 content on the oxidation resistance of the coated C/C composites at 1773K in air was also investigated. The weight loss curves revealed that introducing the appropriate proportion of Si3N4 could improve the oxidation resistance of coating. The MoSi2-SiOC/SiC coated C/C sample had an accelerated weight loss after oxidation in air for 20h. However, the coating containing 45% Si3N4 could protect C/C composition from oxidation for 100h with a minute weight loss of 0.63%.","Niu, Fang-xu;Wang, Yan-xiang;Abbas, Imran;Fu, Shan-long;Wang, Cheng-guo",2017-02-15,Ceramics International,"Carbon/carbon composite,Oxidation,Coating,Polymer-derived ceramic",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.11.151,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.11.151
Preparation of a CeO2-nanoparticle thermal radiation shield coating on ZrO2 fibers via a hydrothermal method,"For the first time, a uniform CeO2-nanoparticle coating was deposited onto the surface of submicron ZrO2 fibers via a hydrothermal method to reflect and scatter radiation in the infrared region to reduce the heat transfer. The crystal phase, microstructure and optical properties of the obtained heterostructure were examined using XRD, SEM, TEM, EDS and FT-IR techniques. The results show that the CeO2 coating consists of nanoparticles with a grain size of 18nm and that the coating thickness can be controlled through adjusting the hydrothermal temperature and time. The CeO2 coating uniformly deposited on the surface of the ZrO2 fibers with good thermal stability can be used as a radiative reflective coating. The effective specific extinction (e*) was enhanced due to the high reflectivity and high scattering of the CeO2 particles. A thicker coating resulted in a stronger infrared extinction capability in the sample. Moreover, the coated fibers have higher e* values than the uncoated fibers at high temperatures. When the fibers were coated with a thickness of 155nm, the average value of e* at 1200°C was improved by approximately 2 times compared with that of the uncoated fibers in the wavelength range of 2.5–10µm.","Gan, Xinzhu;Yu, Zhichao;Yuan, Kangkang;Xu, Chonghe;Wang, Xinqiang;Zhu, Luyi;Zhang, Guanghui;Xu, Dong",2017-11-30,Ceramics International,"ZrO2 fibers,Hydrothermal method,Radiation,CeO2 coating,Effective specific extinction",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.161,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.161
Effect of layer thickness on thermal shock behavior in double-layer micro- and nano-structured ceramic top coat APS TBCs,"The performance of thermal barrier coatings with the double-layer top coat in thermal shock condition has been investigated. Used powders to produce coatings are as follows: Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ, Y), Ceria-Yttria Stabilized Zirconium Oxide (CSZ, C) and nano-structured YSZ (YSZ-N, YN). The samples were classified into four double-layer families, including Y-C, YN-C, Y-YN and YN-Y. At the end of each cycle, samples were photographed, and the surface and edge damage were determined. Furthermore, scanning electron microscope (SEM) Images and energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) analysis of sample's cross-section were taken before and after the test. After collecting experiment's data, the effects of various factors on the outputs were checked. The results showed that Y-YN, YN-Y and YN-C families, have the best performance, respectively. Moreover, it was found that using YSZ-N as the top layer, reduces the thickness of TGO, and it has a great effect on performance and the amount of damage.","Ashofteh, A.;Mashhadi, M.

Synthesis of chemically bonded phosphate ceramic coatings with tailored curing behaviour and enhanced oxidation resistance,"The objective of this study was to develop chemically bonded phosphate ceramic (CBPC) coatings with relatively low curing temperature, properly prolonged curing time, and enhanced oxidation resistance. The coating was synthesised using aluminium phosphate as binder, surface modified MgOw/MgO as curing agent, and spherical microscaled Al particle as filler. The MgOw/MgO curing agent was surface coated by an Al2O3 layer via sol-gel routes. The Al2O3-coated MgOw/MgO agent facilitated a controllable curing process owing to the sustained-release effect of the surrounding microstructure. The weight loss profiles of all CBPCs with a surface modified curing agent exhibited a quasi-parabolic trend. The curing time decreased with the addition of the curing agent, and the Al2O3-coated MgOw curing agent was more effective owing to the good dispersion and larger particle number/volume percentage. The thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry curves proved that the Al element exhibited similar effect as Mg2+, which could also enhance the curing process via substitution reaction between the basic metal ions with hydrogen in phosphate. Therefore, the addition of Al filler resulted in further curing and densification, exhibiting a decrease in the curing time (30–50 min) and increase in the weight loss (~40%). Proper binder-to-curing agent-to-filler mass (B:C:F) ratio was very important, and the CBPCs with improved surface roughness, hardness, and free of cracks were synthesised at a B:C:F ratio of 10:1:0.05. During oxidation at 800 °C, the Al filler in the CBPCs transformed into a continuous Al2O3 layer, which protected the Ti6Al4V alloy from further oxidation.","Yang, Mei;Liu, Fujiao;Guo, Zhixing;Han, Bing;Luo, Xia",2020-08-15,Ceramics International,"Aluminium phosphate,CBPC,MgOw,Curing,Oxidation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.143,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.143
Spherical indentations on hafnium carbide- and silicon-carbide-coated carbon–carbon composites after thermal shock test in air,"In this study, high-temperature oxidations and indentations on silicon carbide (SiC)- and hafnium carbide (HfC)-coated carbon–carbon (C/C) composites were investigated to prevent the oxidation of C/C composites in air. The SiC and HfC layers were coated to protect the composite from oxidizing in air at a high temperature. High-temperature oxidation tests were performed at 500 °C, 1,000 °C, 1,350 °C, and 1,500 °C for 1 h in air and then cooled to room temperature by thermal shock. This cycle was repeated until the coating layer was damaged. As a result of measuring the weight change according to the thermal cycle and observing the fiber damage in the C/C composites, the oxidation resistance of HfC was evaluated to be superior to that of SiC. The change of the mechanical behavior was investigated using an indentation test with a tungsten carbide ball with a radius of either 3.18 or 7.93 mm before and after the high-temperature oxidation test by thermal shock. The relative elastic modulus was predicted based on the slope of the indentation load–displacement curve during loading or that of the curve during unloading. The relative hardness was also analyzed based on residual displacement after indentation. The hardness and elastic modulus of the HfC and SiC coating were higher than those of C/C composites and the mechanical properties of the HfC-coated C/C composite were relatively good compared with those of the SiC-coated composites prior to the thermal shock test. In particular, in this study, it was found that the mechanical behaviors of HfC-coated C/C composites exposed to temperatures >1,000 °C in air were transferred from elastic to quasi-plastic. The quasi-plasticity of the HfC coating layer was evaluated to be excellent regarding its resistance to mechanical damage as the coating layer was not easily delaminated or damaged even by oxidation.","Lee, Kee Sung;Meng, Zicheng;Sihn, Ihn-Cheol;Choi, Kyoon;Lee, Ji Eun;Bae, Soobin;Lee, Hyung-Ik",2020-09-30,Ceramics International,"Carbon-carbon composites,Coating,Hafnium carbide,Indentation,Mechanical behavior",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.211,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.211
Reaction synthesis of spark plasma sintered MoSi2-B4C coatings for oxidation protection of Nb alloy,"MoSi2-B4C coatings with different B4C contents were prepared on Nb alloy by spark plasma sintering (SPS) process. Powder mixtures of Mo, Si and B4C were used as the coating starting materials. Besides MoSi2 and B4C phases, small amounts of SiC and MoB are also found in the coatings because of the reactions of Mo, Si and B4C powders during sintering. Compared with single MoSi2 coating, the MoSi2-B4C coatings show better oxidation resistance at 1450 ℃, and dense B2O3-SiO2 oxide scales form after 100 h oxidation. The B4C or MoB in the MoSi2-B4C coatings can serve as the B donor for the formation of B2O3. A slight degradation in the microstructure of the MoSi2-B4C coatings after oxidation is observed, which can be attributed to the presence of an NbB layer in the inter-diffusion zone of the coatings that retards the inward diffusion of Si from the coating into the substrate alloy. The microstructure development and oxidation behavior of the MoSi2-B4C coatings have been discussed.","Zhang, Ping;Chen, Chenglong;Chen, Zheng;Ren, Xuanru;Shen, Chengjin;Feng, Peizhong",2019-03-31,Ceramics International,"MoSi2-B4C coating,Spark plasma sintering,Nb alloy,Oxidation resistance,Diffusion behavior",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.103,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.103
Crystallization of hydroxyapatite during hydrothermal treatment on amorphous calcium phosphate layer coated by PEO technique,"Surface modification of titanium implants is recently considered by several researchers. In this study, PEO was performed over commercially Ti-6Al-4V alloy pellets in an aqueous electrolyte containing calcium acetate (C.A.) and calcium glycerphosphate (Ca–GP) with a Ca/P molar ratio of 6.8, and applying current density of 0.212A/cm2, frequency of 100Hz and duty ratio of 60% for 4min. In the next step, hydrothermal treatments were carried out for various durations and at different temperatures inside an autoclave chamber containing a NaOH solution with pH of 11.5. XRD and SEM results confirmed formation of needle-shaped HAp after all hydrothermal conditions. Maximum intensity of HAp peaks was observed for the hydrothermally treated sample at 190°C for 15h. Moreover, crystallinity degree of HAp was increased by increasing hydrothermal duration and temperature. According to the SEM line scan analysis of cross section of the PEO coated sample after hydrothermal treatment at 190°C for 15h, it seems that Ca+2 and [PO4]−3 ions from internal layer of amorphous coating diffuse to the coating surface and dissolve into the solution during hydrothermal treatment, and finally precipitate on the outer layer of coating as needle-shaped HAp.","Faghihi-Sani, Mohammad-Ali;Arbabi, Ali;Mehdinezhad-Roshan, Aida",2013-03-31,Ceramics International,"D: Hydroxyapatite,Coating,Hydrothermal,PEO",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.08.026,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.08.026
Modeling of the temperature field in a porous thermal barrier coating,"Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are advanced materials systems with low thermal conductivity. One of the reasons for the low thermal conductivity in TBCs is that they contain porous structures created by a network of micro-voids. In the present investigation, experimental and analytical studies of heat transfer in TBCs having different levels of porosity were performed. The ceramic coatings were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy to calculate the level of porosity and micro-pore size distribution. A two-dimensional FE model was then developed, where a stochastic method was used to define randomly distributed porous structures equivalent to porosities of 1%, 3%, and 5%. The results showed that the heat flux and temperature gradient were affected by the interactions between neighboring micro-pores and micro-pores/ceramic coatings, and that the effect of the micro-pores was limited to a small area (2–2.5 times the micro-pore radius). Based on the obtained results, a set of effective thermal conductivity equations are proposed which more clearly describe the heat transfer process in a porous TBC structure. Two different equivalent thermal resistance models were used to study the heat transfer process under low porosity (<3%) and high porosity (>3%) conditions.","Cui, Shiyu;Miao, Qiang;Domblesky, Joseph P.;Liang, Wenping;Song, Youpeng",2019-07-31,Ceramics International,"Porosity,Effective thermal conductivity,Equivalent thermal resistance models,And thermal barrier",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.166,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.166
Hydroxyapatite-doped poly(lactic acid) porous film coating for enhanced bioactivity and corrosion behavior of AZ31 Mg alloy for orthopedic applications,"The corrosion behavior of magnesium and its alloys in the electrolytic physiological environment is extremely poor; this imposes a limitation for their use in orthopedic applications. In the present study, the effect of spray coating AZ31 magnesium alloy with membrane films of pristine and hydroxyapatite-doped poly(lactic acid) on corrosion behavior and bioactivity is investigated. Polymer concentration was found to have a strong impact on the pore size of the coating layer. However, addition of HAp NPs distinctly stimulated the precipitation of an apatite-like compound upon soaking the samples in a simulated body fluid (SBF). Magnesium coated samples revealed three orders of magnitude less corrosion compared to the naked samples, which indicates a stable electrochemical corrosion resistance. During a 15 days in-vitro test, pH variation, weight loss, and bending strength were lower for the coated samples (with average values of 8.5%, 7.2% and 10%, respectively) than the control sample (10.5%, 15.5%, and 25%, respectively). Moreover, the coated samples showed good bending strength characteristics. Cytocompatibility studies on MC3T3 cells revealed a continuous increase in cell growth with the coated samples. Overall, the suggested strategy might open a new avenue to widen utilization of Mg alloys as implant materials for orthopedic applications.","Abdal-hay, Abdalla;Barakat, Nasser A.M.;Lim, Jae Kyoo",2013-01-31,Ceramics International,"Mg alloys,Poly (lactic acid),Orthopedic applications,Biodegradable implants",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.06.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.06.008
Effect of substrate type on nanostructured titania sol–gel coatings for sensors applications,"Titania coatings were obtained by the sol–gel method, starting from stable and transparent titania sol. Thin titania coatings were deposited onto different substrates: quartz glass, single crystal quartz (101), single crystal Si(100) and alumina. Effect of substrate type and heat treatment conditions on important characteristics determining the sensing properties were studied. Nanostructured titania coatings with grain size up to 50nm and thickness less than 1μm were obtained on all substrates, but their phase composition depends on substrate type. The slightly orientation of titania coatings as well as the interactions between titania coating and alumina and silicon single crystal were observed.","Nikolić, Ljubica M.;Radonjić, Ljijana;Srdić, Vladimir V.",2005-12-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Fabrication of corrosion resistant hydrophobic ceramic nanocomposite coatings on PEO treated AA7075,"Ceramic composite coatings were fabricated on AA7075 by plasma electrolytic oxidation method in silicate + KOH electrolyte with α-Al2O3 or m-ZrO2 nanoparticles. The significant differences between α-Al2O3 and m-ZrO2 nanoparticles incorporation on PEO coating morphology, composition and thickness were analysed using X-ray diffractometer, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Corrosion behaviour of the coatings was evaluated by potentiodynamic polarisation (PDP) and salt spray test. The results showed that the hard α-Al2O3 incorporated coating showed better corrosion resistance than m-ZrO2 incorporated coating. The presence of hard α-Al2O3 in the coating structure and higher thickness has played a key role in improving the corrosion resistance of the α-Al2O3 particles incorporated coating. To further enhance the corrosion resistance, hydrophobic surfaces were fabricated on α-Al2O3 incorporated PEO treated AA7075 and m-ZrO2 incorporated PEO treated AA7075 by stearic acid treatment and myristic acid treatment. The coatings morphology and wettability were assessed using SEM and contact angle goniometer. The corrosion behaviour of the hydrophobically modified PEO treated samples was studied through PDP test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) method in 3.5wt% NaCl solution. The results indicated that the corrosion resistance of the nanoparticle incorporated PEO coatings significantly improved by the hydrophobic treatments. Among the modified coatings, the stearic acid modified α-Al2O3 incorporated PEO treated sample exhibited highest Ecorr and lowest icorr values. The sealed pore morphology has a significant role in enhancing the corrosion resistance of the stearic acid modified α-Al2O3 incorporated PEO sample.","T., Arunnellaiappan;S., Arun;S., Hariprasad;S., Gowtham;B., Ravisankar;L., Rama Krishna;N., Rameshbabu",2018-01-31,Ceramics International,"AA7075,Al2O3-ZrO2 coating,Plasma electrolytic oxidation,Hydrophobic modification,Corrosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.014
Effect of silica coating on the structural and luminescent properties of Sm3+/Yb3+ or Tm3+/Yb3+ co-doped TiO2 nanoparticles,"The luminescent characteristics of spherical titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles (NP's) doped with Sm3+/Yb3+ and Tm3+/Yb3+ with and without a silica coating were analyzed. These nanoparticles were synthesized using the spray pyrolysis technique and coated with silica through a wet chemical process. The Sm3+/Tm3+ and Yb3+ doping induces a triphasic poly-crystalline structure of rutile and anatase TiO2 and a Sm2Ti2O7/Tm2Ti2O7 cubic phase. A Williamson-Hall analysis was used to monitor the tensions of the NP's crystallites at the various doping concentrations and with addition of the silica shell. The luminescent spectra presented the characteristic emission peaks for the electronic energy levels transitions of the Sm3+/Tm3+ and Yb3+ ions. The Sm3+/Yb3+ co-doped NP's showed a maximum emission peak in the visible region at 612 nm, associated with 4G5/2 → 6H7/2 transitions of the Sm3+ ions. The IR emission peak at 973 nm (2F5/2 → 2F7/2) pertaining to Yb3+. For the combination of Tm3+/Yb3+, two emissions associated with Tm3+ ions were observed at 440 nm (1D2 → 3F4) and 806 nm (3H4 → 3H6). The emission at 973 nm (2F5/2 → 2F7/2) is correlated to the Yb3+ ions. Silica coating of the NP's resulted in luminescence emission intensity increase of about 4 times.","Vargas, Vicente;Sedova, Anastasiya;Moscardini, Susane;Rocha, Lucas;Falcony, Ciro",2020-02-15,Ceramics International,"Spray pyrolysis,Nanocomposites B.,Optical properties C.,TiO2 D",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.044,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.044
Yttrium silicate oxidation protective coating for SiC coated carbon/carbon composites,"Four kinds of yttrium silicate oxidation protective coatings SiO2·Y2O3, 1.5SiO2·Y2O3, 1.5SiO2·Y2O3/SiO2·Y2O3 and 2SiO2·Y2O3/1.5SiO2·Y2O3/SiO2·Y2O3 were prepared by plasma spray on the surface of SiC pre-coated carbon/carbon composites. The structures of the coatings were characterized by XRD, SEM and EDS analyses. It was shown that the gradied 2SiO2·Y2O3/1.5SiO2·Y2O3/SiO2·Y2O3 multi-layer coating had better high-temperature oxidation resistance. It could protect carbon/carbon composites from oxidation at 1773K in air for 73h with a weight loss of less than 2%. The oxidation activation energy of the coated carbon/carbon composites is 87.3kJ/mol, and the oxidation process in C/C substrates with a multi-layer coating was controlled by the rate of oxygen diffusion through the holes in the coating.","Huang, Jian-Feng;Li, He-Jun;Zeng, Xie-Rong;Li, Ke-Zhi",2006-12-31,Ceramics International,"B.

Influence of interface morphology of transition layer on the residual stresses of plasma sprayed ZrC-based coatings examined by finite element simulations,"The influence of the interface morphology of the SiC transition layer, including the shape, roughness and curvature, on the residual stresses of plasma sprayed ZrC-based coatings was simulated and analyzed in the current work. The results indicated that when the valleys and peaks of the interface were removed from the sine wave interface of the transition layer, the maximum values of radial compressive stress and axial tensile stress in the coating have transferred from the peak to the flat valley zone. An abrupt shear stress was found at the peaks and valleys, and a stress gradient was observed at the interface, making it easy to induce cracks perpendicular to the interface. Tensile stress concentration was located at the edge of the coating sample, where a large stress gradient was generated, resulting in easy cracking at the edge of the coating. The transition layer interface of the sine wave with valley-only morphology reduced the residual stress and improved the bonding strength of the interface, which was considered to be the optimal interface. The radial compressive stress and axial tensile stress in the coating increased with increasing interfacial curvature, with more significant changes observed for the axial tensile stress. This will lead to easy cracking and spalling of the coating, which was confirmed by experimental results. When the curvature of the interface is in the range of [0.2,0.3], the coating and substrate have good interface bonding strength.","Xie, Ling-ling;Wang, Liang;Niu, Ya-ran;Liu, Tao;Chen, Wen-liang;Zheng, Xue-bin;Huang, Zhen-yi",2019-07-31,Ceramics International,"Plasma spraying,Transition layer,Morphology,Residual stresses,Finite element simulation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.235,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.235
Improving hardness and toughness of plasma sprayed Ti–Si–C nano-composite coatings by post Ar-annealing,"Ti–Si–C (TSC) composite coatings were fabricated by plasma spraying using Ti/Si/graphite agglomerates as feedstock. Ar-annealing was carried out to reduce the intrinsic defects and increase the performance of the as-sprayed TSC coating. The effects of the annealing temperature (500–900 °C) on the microstructures and mechanical performances of the TSC coatings were investigated. All TSC coatings consisted of TiC, Ti5Si3 and MAX phase Ti3SiC2. With the increase in temperature (>700 °C), TiC became predominant, while the Ti3SiC2 phase content increased, which was accompanied by a decrease in Ti5Si3 content. The high -temperature annealing (>700 °C) led to a homogenous microstructure with a relatively low porosity and increased number of micro-cracks. Notably, the hardness and fracture toughness of the TSC coating were simultaneously increased after the annealing, from 1164 HV to 1.96 MPa m1/2 to 1560 HV and 3.45 MPa m1/2, respectively. The formation of nanoscale TiC and Ti5Si3 with a network distribution, uniform and dense microstructure, and toughening effects of Ti3SiC2 and micro-cracks provided the high mechanical performances of the TSC composite coatings.","Zhang, Fanyong;Li, Chao;Yan, Shu;He, Jining;Yin, Fuxing",2020-09-18,Ceramics International,"Plasma spraying,Ti3SiC2,Nano-composite coating,Microstructure,Fracture toughness",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.154,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.154
Electrophoretic deposition of biomimetic zinc substituted hydroxyapatite coatings with chitosan and carbon nanotubes on titanium,"In this study, a biomimetic method was used to prepare hydroxyapatite (HAP) and zinc substituted HAP (ZnHAP) nanoparticles, in which silk fibroin was used as template. The morphology of HAP is rod-like, while ZnHAP changes to wrinkled sheets. HAP and ZnHAP nanoparticles were used to coat titanium by EPD with additional chitosan and multiwalled carbon nanotubes. Phase composition, morphology and structure were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy. The results showed that the composite coatings containing HAP and ZnHAP had homogeneous morphology and good apatite formation ability. The ZnHAP composite coating possessed class 5B adhesive strength using tape test. Furthermore, the ZnHAP composite coating had better corrosion resistance compared to the HAP composite coatings.","Zhong, Zhenyu;Qin, Jinli;Ma, Jun",2015-08-31,Ceramics International,"Bioactive coatings,Carbon nanotube,Hydroxyapatite,Chitosan,Electrophoretic",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.03.145,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.03.145
Effect of processing parameters on the microstructure and properties of WC–10Co–4Cr coatings formed by a new multi-chamber gas-dynamic accelerator,"Due to its superior sliding, erosive and abrasive wear properties WC–Co–Cr coatings are used in the coating industry. A series of WC–10Co–4Cr coatings (80–375μm thick) have been prepared on a corrosion-resistant steel substrate with a new multi-chamber gas-dynamic accelerator (MCDS) with different powder feed rates (1200, 1500 and 2000, all in g/h). The influence of the powder feed rate on structural characteristics, hardness and wear resistance of the coatings was characterized. The microstructures and properties of the WC–10Co–4Cr coatings were examined with the use of optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray phase analysis, and a Vicker׳s hardness tester at a test load of 300g. The wear behavior was carried out by the ball-on-disk tests. From the results, it was observed that the powder feed rate has influence on coating porosity, hardness and wear resistance. Porosity and wear resistance decreased with decreasing powder feed rate. It was found that a powder feed rate of 1200g/h yielded minimum porosity of less than 0.2% and minimum specific wear rate of 1.234∙10–6 mm3(mN)−1. With an increase in the powder feed rate the hardness of the coatings increases. It was found that the coatings obtained at powder feed rate of 2000g/h showed high hardness 967±230HV0.3.","Kovaleva, M.;Tyurin, Yu;Vasilik, N.;Kolisnichenko, O.;Prozorova, M.;Arseenko, M.;Yapryntsev, M.;Sirota, V.;Pavlenko, I.",2015-12-31,Ceramics International,"D.

"Evaluation of the phase stability, and mechanical and thermal properties of Ba(Sr1/3Ta2/3)O3 as a potential ceramic material for thermal barrier coatings","Ba(Sr1/3Ta2/3)O3 (BST) ceramic was synthesized by a solid-state reaction method. The phase stability, microstructural evolution, and mechanical and thermal properties of the BST ceramic were investigated and characterized to evaluate the potential application of BST as a top coating material for thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). The results show that BST can maintain a stable hexagonal perovskite structure up to 1600 °C. Anisotropic growth of the grains above 1400 °C was observed. Its low elastic modulus and high fracture toughness suggest a high damage tolerance for the BST ceramic. In addition, the moderate coefficient of thermal expansion and superior heat insulation capability of the BST ceramic provide this ceramic the potential to serve as a top coating material of TBCs at higher temperature.","Cao, Yupeng;Wang, Quansheng;Ning, Xianjin;Liu, Yanbo",2019-07-31,Ceramics International,"Perovskite,Thermal barrier coatings,Phase stability,Thermal properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.227,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.227
A new one-dimensional photonic crystal combination of TiO2/CuO for structural color applications,"Owing to their unique optical properties, an interest in 1-D multilayer photonic crystals has been recently extremely on increase. By creating multilayer coatings, structural colors can be obtained without any required pigment. In this study, stacked layers of TiO2 and CuO photonic crystal coatings were produced by using the sol-gel method for up to seven layers from alternatively anatase and tenorite phases. The combination of the TiO2 layer with the CuO layer has been studied for the production of photonic crystal coatings that can lead to many applications such as structural color, optical sensor, and optic filters. It was proved that structural colors such as violet, green, blue and indigo could be successfully obtained from three and five layered photonic crystal coatings.

Rapid microwave-assisted synthesis of gold loaded hydroxyapatite collagen nano-bio materials for drug delivery and tissue engineering application,"A rapid microwave assisted facile synthetic technique was adopted to load gold nanoparticles (Au) on hydroxyapatite (HAp) surface. HAp nanoparticles were primarily synthesized by wet precipitation technique and further used for gold loading and successive collagen coating for biomedical applications. The microwave-assisted controlled synthesis technique with three heating cycles allows the very fast growing of Au seeds over HAp facets. Different sophisticated analytical techniques and spectroscopic characterization were employed to confirm the structural, chemical, and morphological features. The synthesized different concentration “Au” loaded hetero nanostructures coated with collagen (Au–HAp–Col) optimized for drug (Doxorubicin: DOX) loading and releasing purposes for biomedical applications. The maximum drug-loading efficiency of ~58.22% and a pH responsive releasing of ~53% (at pH 4.5) was obtained for 0.1 wt% Au–HAp–Col nanoparticles. To study the cytotoxic effects from the hetero nanostructures, MG-63 osteoblast-like cells were exposed to different concentration ranges on Au–HAp, Au–HAp–Col, and DOX loaded Au–HAp–Col nanoparticles. The non-toxic and bioactive properties of the synthesized nanoparticle-fabricated scaffold promotes cellular attachment, growth, and proliferation.

Photocatalytic activity of thin TiO2 films deposited using sol–gel and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition methods,"Thin titanium dioxide films, deposited using RF PECVD and sol–gel techniques, were studied comparatively with respect to their bactericidal as well as self-cleaning properties. The effect of the deposition process on film morphology, chemical and crystalline structure, bactericidal activity and hydrophilic properties was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), surface profilometry, optical microscopy and contact angle measurements. It was found that the bactericidal activity of amorphous TiO2 films, produced using the RF PECVD method, as either comparable to or better than those of crystalline (anatase) films deposited by means of the sol–gel technique. One reason for such advantageous behavior of plasma deposited materials is thought to be their substantially higher surface roughness, as revealed by AFM measurements. The hydrophilic effect, induced with UV irradiation, was strongest in the case of sol–gel films, but the RF PECVD synthesized coatings were found to be only slightly less hydrophilic. The conclusion follows that both sol–gel and RF PECVD techniques are equally capable of producing titanium dioxide films of high photocatalytic quality.","Sobczyk-Guzenda, Anna;Pietrzyk, Bożena;Szymanowski, Hieronim;Gazicki-Lipman, Maciej;Jakubowski, Witold",2013-04-30,Ceramics International,"D.

Mechanical properties of warm sprayed HATi bio-ceramic composite coatings,"To explore a new approach for fabricating the load bearing implants with the combination of bioactivity, biocompatibility, and mechanical properties, mechanically mixed hydroxyapatite (HA) and titanium (Ti) powders containing 30, 50, and 70 wt% Ti were sprayed onto a 316L stainless steel substrate using a warm spray (WS) process. The microstructures, phase compositions, chemical structures, and mechanical properties of WS HATi composite coatings were comprehensively investigated and compared to those of WS HA coating. Experimental results indicate that the cross-sectional microstructures of WS HATi composite coatings present typical lamellar structures composed of curved stripes formed by well-deformed and oxidized Ti splats and limited deformed HA splats, and are significantly influenced by the Ti content in the original powders.

Chemical structures of HA in the composite coatings deposited using powders with Ti content less than 30% are similar to the structures in the original powder.

Measurement of temperature-dependent thermal conductivity for PVD Ti0.55Al0.45N ceramic coating by time domain thermo-reflectance method,"Accurate measuring temperature-dependent thermal conductivities of (Ti,Al)N ceramic coating is important to quantitatively analyze the thermal effects of (Ti,Al)N ceramic coating on the heat generation and heat transfer during cutting process by PVD (Ti,Al)N coated cemented tools. In this paper, the temperature-dependent thermal conductivities of PVD Ti0.55Al0.45N ceramic coating with coating thickness of 2 µm in the temperature ranges of 25–500 °C are measured by time domain thermo-reflectance method. Firstly, the detailed deposition process and microstructure characterization of PVD Ti0.55Al0.45N ceramic coating are presented. Secondly, the measuring principle and measuring procedure of PVD ceramic coating thermal conductivity with the time domain thermo-reflectance are proposed. Then, the measured thermal properties of substrate are used in the calculation algorithm to obtain the thermal conductivity of Ti0.55Al0.45N ceramic coating at the specific temperature, which can eliminate the variation influences of substrate thermal properties with temperature. Lastly, the obtained thermal conductivities of PVD Ti0.55Al0.45N ceramic coating are verified to be increased with the increase of temperature in the temperature ranges of 25–500 °C. The relationship between the thermal conductivity of PVD Ti0.55Al0.45N coating and temperature can be represented by quadratic polynominal equation.

Influence of different coating structures on the oxidation resistance of MoSi2 coatings,"Two different structures of MoSi2 coatings were prepared on Niobium based alloys by using a two step process. The as-deposited type(a) MoSi2 coating structure consists of a MoSi2 layer on the surface and a NbSi2 layer underneath, while the type(b) MoSi2 coating consists of an outer MoSi2 layer and an inner unsiliconized Mo layer. The oxidation behaviors of the two different types MoSi2 coatings were examined at 1200 °C for 100 h in air, and the mass gains of type(a) and type(b) MoSi2 coated specimens were 0.64 mg/cm2 and 0.59 mg/cm2 respectively. The excellent oxidation resistance of both type(a) and type(b) MoSi2 coated samples at 1200 °C was due to the formation of a dense and continuous SiO2 scale during oxidation. As the CTE mismatch between the outer MoSi2 coating and the inner layer, cracks distributed within both type(a) and type(b) MoSi2 coating structures.","Liu, L.;Zhang, H.Q.;Lei, H.;Li, H.Q.;Gong, J.;Sun, C.",2020-04-01,Ceramics International,"Niobium-based alloy,Intermetallics,Pack cementation,Coating,Oxidation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.055,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.055
A comparative study of microstructural and tribological properties of N-DLC/DLC double layer and single layer coatings deposited by DC-pulsed PACVD process,"Diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings have been attractive for their unique properties such as high wear resistance, high hardness, chemical inertness, and biocompatibility. The double layer N-DLC/DLC coating was deposited by the D.C. Pulsed Plasma Assisted Chemical Vapour Deposition (PACVD) technique on the H13 Tool Steel. The structural, mechanical, and tribological properties of the double layer coating were compared with the single layer DLC and N-DLC coatings. The tribological behavior of the coatings was evaluated by the rotational ball-on-disk tribometer and the contact profilometer. The structural changes in the coatings were investigated by Attenuated-Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) Spectroscopy, Visible Raman Spectroscopy, and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The N-DLC/DLC coating showed excellent wear properties compared to single layer coatings. High stability and low friction coefficient are the most important characteristics of the double layer coating. It was found that the gradient properties in the mechanical and chemical composition of the N-DLC/DLC coating improve tribological properties and adhesion to the substrate compared to single layer.","Sharifahmadian, Omid;Mahboubi, Farzad",2019-04-15,Ceramics International,"Double layer,Nitrogen,Wear properties,DLC,Plasma",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.076,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.076

In addition, we determined under what conditions such an alumina coating over a diatomite–kaolin composite support layer could be prepared with minimum micro-crack generation during heat-treatment.

It was found that with the APS method, the indentation load–depth curve gave the indentation depth and the residual depth smaller than and the yield stress greater than those with the HPPS. On the basis of fracture morphology in the cross-section, it has been conjectured that the APS coating has greater elastic modulus than the HPPS coating, and exhibits high strength exceeding debonding force between bond coat and top coat.","Akimune, Yoshio;Matsuo, Kazuo;Sodeoka, Satoshi;Sugiyama, Tatsuo;Shimizu, Satoshi",2004-12-31,Ceramics International,"Indentation,Plasma spray coating,Hertz cone crack,Elastic–plastic response debonding",10.1016/j.ceramint.2003.12.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2003.12.008
Fabrication of nanoporous sodium niobate coating on 316L SS for orthopaedics,"Niobium oxide is known for its biocompatibility; however it lacks on bioactivity. Sodium is one of the essential elements required for the formation and maintenance of bone. In this present study, we focus on improving the bioactivity of niobium oxide by incorporating sodium ions and obtaining nanoporous morphology by adding polyethylene glycol. Sodium niobate was prepared using sol-gel method and dip coated on 316L SS. The coated sample was sintered at the optimised heating rate of 0.5°Cmin−1. The surface morphology, chemical composition, phase composition and porosity were analysed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and porosimetry. The BET analysis and AFM studies showed that the coating exhibited pores with the average diameter of 97 and 101nm. The Vicker's microhardness test showed that sodium niobate coating exhibits three fold higher microhardness compared to 316L SS. In vitro studies show that the coating exhibited good bioactivity. Electrochemical studies confirmed that the coating offers better corrosion resistance to the substrate at pH 5.2 and pH 7.4. The hemolysis percentage of the coating was found to be 1.54% and anticoagulation studies showed that coagulation time of sodium niobate coating was similar to that of the plasma. Better adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of MG-63 cells with significant cell spreading were observed in the coating.","Saranya, K.;Thirupathi Kumara Raja, S.;Subhasree, R.S.;Gnanamani, A.;Das, Sujoy K.;Rajendran, N.",2017-10-15,Ceramics International,"Sodium niobate,316L SS,Corrosion resistance,Hemocompatibility,Cell culture",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.104,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.104
Antibacterial efficiency of alkali-free bio-glasses incorporating ZnO and/or SrO as therapeutic agents,"A series of seven alkali-free silica-based bioactive glasses (SBG) with ZnO and/or SrO additives (in concentrations of 0–12 mol%) were synthesized by melt-quenching, aiming to delineate a candidate formulation possessing (i) a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) similar to the one of titanium (Ti) and its medical grade super-alloys (crucial for the future development of mechanically adherent implant-type SBG coatings) and (ii) antibacterial efficiency, while (iii) conserving a good cytocompatibility. The SBGs powders were multi-parametrically evaluated by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared and micro-Raman spectroscopy, dilatometry, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, antibacterial (against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli strains) suspension inhibition and agar diffusion tests, and human mesenchymal stem cells cytocompatibility assays. The results showed that the coupled incorporation of zinc and strontium ions into the parent glass composition has a combinatorial and additive benefit. In particular, the “Z6S4” formulation (mol%: SiO2—38.49, CaO—32.07, P2O5—5.61, MgO—13.24, CaF2—0.59, ZnO—6.0, SrO—4.0) conferred strong antimicrobial activity against both types of strains, minimal cytotoxicity combined with good stem cells viability and proliferation, and a CTE (~ 8.7 × 10−6 × °C−1) matching well those of the Ti-based implant materials.","Popa, A.C.;Fernandes, H.R.;Necsulescu, M.;Luculescu, C.;Cioangher, M.;Dumitru, V.;Stuart, B.W.;Grant, D.M.;Ferreira, J.M.F.;Stan, G.E.",2019-03-31,Ceramics International,"Bioactive glass,Doping,CTE,Antibacterial activity,Cytocompatibility",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.112,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.112

Tailoring interfacial interaction through glass fusion in glass/zinc-hydroxyapatite composite coatings on glass-infiltrated zirconia,"In the current study, the biocompatibility and mechanical characteristics of glass-infiltrated zirconia were improved via a simple composite coating made of Zn-doped hydroxyapatite (ZnHA) ceramic and a silicate-based glass. During thermal treatment, significant reaction and crystallisation occurred and some of the ZnHA was transformed into β-tricalcium phosphate, calcium oxide phosphate, and calcium zirconium oxide. Moreover, the glass crystallised into a sodium calcium aluminium silicate phase. The mechanical properties were investigated and the results indicated that the amount of glass in the composite and in the glass-infiltrated zirconia layer strongly affected the flexural strength and adhesion of the coating layer. The composite coatings on the glass-infiltrated zirconia displayed better mechanical properties than the pure ZnHA coating due to the newly formed crystalline phases. Murine pre-osteoblastic (MC3T3-E1) cells adhered to and spread well on the composite coating surfaces. The cell viability results revealed that the glass/ZnHA composites demonstrated a superior bioactivity of osteoblast cells compared to uncoated zirconia. These results show that the glass/ZnHA composites on the glass-infiltrated zirconia structure are suitable for use as hard tissue implant coatings due to their morphological and mechanical stability and enhanced bioactivity to pre-osteoblastic cells.","Sakthiabirami, Kumaresan;Vu, Van Thi;Kim, Ji Won;Kang, Jin Ho;Jang, Kyoung Jun;Oh, Gye Jeong;Fisher, John G.;Yun, Kwi Dug;Lim, Hyun Pil;Park, Sang Won",2018-10-01,Ceramics International,"Glass,Composites,Mechanical properties,ZrO2",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.161,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.161
Binder-free 3D porous Fe3O4–Fe2P–Fe@C films as high-performance anode materials for lithium-ion batteries,"Slow lithium storage reaction kinetics and huge volume changes are the main limiting factors for the large-scale application of transition metal oxide anode materials for lithium ion batteries. Developing multi-structure and carbon coating films is a promising solution. Herein, a facile strategy for synthesizing novel binder-free 3D porous Fe3O4–Fe2P–Fe@C films is proposed based on the electrodeposition of self-supporting porous FeOOH–FeP–Fe films, glucose coating to form FeOOH–FeP–Fe@Glucose films, and oxygen-free annealing treatment for the decomposition of FeOOH into Fe3O4, phase separation of FeP into Fe2P–Fe3P and pyrolysis of glucose into C. The binder-free Fe3O4–Fe2P–Fe@C film anode exhibits high reversible capacity (914 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.1 A g−1), superior rate capability (518 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1), and stable long cycling performance (723 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 2 A g−1). The excellent lithium storage performance of the Fe3O4–Fe2P–Fe@C anode is attributed to the synergistic effects of the self-supporting 3D porous film structure, multi-phase structure, and carbon coating, which not only enhances the Li+ and electron transport to accelerate the reaction kinetics, but also buffers the volume changes to improve the structure stability during reversible charge-discharge process.","Yu, Xiangtao;Yang, Jun;Yuan, Zhangfu;Guo, Lingbo;Sui, Zhuyin;Wang, Mingyong",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"Co-electrodeposition,Self-supporting porous films,Carbon coating,Multi-phase Fe3O4–Fe2P–Fe,Lithium ion batteries",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.041,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.041
Electrophoretic deposition of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles in different alcohols: Effect of Tris (tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane) as a dispersant,"The suspensions of HA nanoparticles (20g/L) in different alcohols (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and butanol) were prepared and Tris (tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane) was used as a dispersant to enhance their colloidal stability. It was found that H+Tris ions generated through the Tris protonation in the alcoholic suspensions are chemically adsorbed on the HA nanoparticles via hydrogen bonding with their surface P–OH groups increasing their zeta potential and so their colloidal stability. It was found that the higher the molecular weight of alcohol the lower the concentration of generated H+Tris ions in them; so the higher concentration of Tris should be added into them to saturate the surface of HA nanoparticles with H+Tris ions leading to the higher amounts for optimum concentration of Tris in them. Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) was performed at 60V for different times. EPD kinetics was the fastest from the suspensions with optimum concentration of Tris due to the highest zeta potential and so the highest mobility of particles in them. The coatings deposited from the suspensions with optimum concentration of Tris had the uniform, fine and agglomerate-free microstructure; so these coatings can act as the effective barrier against the corrosive fluid to reach the substrate surface leading to the higher reduction in corrosion rate of substrate.","Farrokhi-Rad, Morteza",2016-02-01,Ceramics International,"Electrophoretic deposition (EPD),Hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles,Tris (tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane),Alcohol,Coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.10.130,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.10.130
Improved resistance of lanthanum zirconate coatings to calcium-magnesium-alumina-silicate corrosion through composition tailoring,"Calcium–magnesium–alumina–silicate (CMAS) corrosion resistance is an important issue on the design of next-generation thermal battier coatings. As one of the promising thermal battier coatings, the lanthanum zirconate coating has attracted continuous attention. In this work, three lanthanum zirconate coatings with different La/Zr composition, i.e., La1.8Zr2.2O7.1, La2Zr2O7, and La2.5Zr1.5O6.75, are fabricated by laser-enhanced chemical vapour deposition, and their resistance to CMAS corrosion at 1250 °C is investigated. Among them, La2.5Zr1.5O6.75 shows the best CMAS corrosion resistance because increased La content is beneficial to the formation of a dense and continuous apatite Ca2La8(SiO4)6O2 layer, which effectively slows down the subsequent molten CMAS penetration. This study clarifies the significant role of rare earth on CMAS corrosion resistance and is expected to guide the future design of rare-earth-based thermal battier coatings through composition tailoring.","Zhu, Changhua;Liu, Yuchen;Wang, Duojin;Zhou, Yanchun;Yang, Guang;Chen, Hongfei;Gao, Yanfeng;Liu, Bin",2018-08-15,Ceramics International,"Lanthanum zirconate,Thermal barrier coating,Laser-enhanced chemical vapour deposition,Calcium–magnesium–alumina–silicate corrosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.239,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.239
Influence of feedstocks on processes and microstructure of flame-sprayed SOFC anode,"This study aims to fabricate a porous anode coating for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) by the flame spraying. Flame spraying is an easy low-temperature process and offers the advantage of a reduced thermal stress. Due to the low-temperature, the initial selection of the feedstock will affect the deposition of the coating. In this study, two kinds of feedstocks were used. One was the commonly used NiO/8YSZ for anode fabrication. The second was the Ni metal with 8YSZ design for the low temperature flame spray. The special nickel-coated graphite (NiGr) was employed as the pore former. The results show that NiO/8YSZ forms a uniform and flat coating with small-sized pores. The Ni/8YSZ powder forms a rough coating containing large-scale pores. The addition of NiGr into the composite powder increases the porosity and permeability of the anode after graphite burn out and hydrogen reduction. In summary, the use of a Ni/8YSZ/NiGr feedstock yields higher porosity (35–40%), gas permeability (1.37 Darcy), bonding strength (45.6 ± 3.18MPa) and better anode conductivity.","Yang, Yung-Chin;Zhang, Jin;Lin, Kui-Yi;Sun, Pei-Kai;Tseng, Han-Cheng",2017-08-31,Ceramics International,"B: porosity,C: Electrical conductivity,E: Fuel cells,Solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.283,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.283
Ablation behavior and thermal protection performance of TaSi2 coating for SiC coated carbon/carbon composites,"For extending application of TaSi2 in complex coating system, the ablation behavior and thermal protection performance of TaSi2 coating is studied to evaluate its potential applications for anti-ablation protection of C/C composites. TaSi2 coating is prepared by supersonic atmospheric plasma spraying (SAPS) on the surface of SiC coated carbon/carbon (C/C) composites. Phase variation and microstructure are characterized by XRD and SEM, respectively.

The linear and mass ablation rates are 0.9 µm s−1 and − 0.4 mg s−1 after ablation for 80 s, respectively Results show that the prepared coating possesses optimal ablation performance under the heat flux of 2.4 MW/m2. Moreover, the TaSi2 coating and SiC inner coating have good chemical and physical compatibility during the ablation process.

"Improved structural, mechanical, corrosion and tribocorrosion properties of Ti45Nb alloys by TiN, TiAlN monolayers, and TiAlN/TiN multilayer ceramic films","In this study, TiN, TiAlN monolayers, and TiAlN/TiN multilayer ceramic films on the surface of Ti45Nb substrates were formed via the cathodic arc physical vapour deposition process. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy, nano-indentation testing and surface tension testing. The corrosion performance of the samples was evaluated via potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements and their tribocorrosion behaviour was evaluated by a ball on flat reciprocating tribotester in which the tribological contact was immersed in the electrolyte. The obtained structural and mechanical results indicated that multilayer films have finer grain sizes, and more stable and harder film structures compared with the monolayer coatings. Moreover, the surfaces of the samples exhibited different wetting characteristics. While uncoated and single layer (TiN, TiAlN) coatings showed hydrophilic behaviour, the multilayer coating exhibited hydrophobic behaviour. During the corrosion and tribocorrosion tests, all of the coatings showed a protective feature due to the ceramic structure of the coatings against corrosion and tribocorrosion. Among all of the ceramic coatings, the best results were obtained for the multilayer film.","Çomaklı, Onur",2020-10-01,Ceramics International,"TiNb45,CAPVD,TiAlN/TiN multilayer Film,Corrosion,Tribocorrosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.292,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.292

Electron beam assisted physical vapor deposition of very hard TiCN coating with nanoscale characters,"The work concerns electron beam assisted physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD) of titanium carbo-nitride (TiCN) on D2 tool steel. First, D2 steel substrate was heat treated to support and improve the load bearing capacity of the coating. To reduce the intrinsic gap between D2 substrate and TiCN coating and to improve the adhesive strength of the coating, a thin bond coat of Ti was EB-PV deposited on D2 steel prior to TiCN coating. The deposited coating was characterized in depth using XRD, SEM, AFM, profilometry and nanoindentation; its performance was assessed by the wear tests. The results demonstrated that EB-PVD process is successful in uniform deposition of nanograined (5.7 nm) TiCN coating; this character of the coating enhances its mechanical responses and cohesive strength. AFM topographic characterization confirms nanoscale smoothness of the TiCN coating which is a key factor in upgrading the wear resistance and tribological behavior of the coating. Nanoindentation results showed that the deposited coating is very hard; it is also tough enough. The hardness of the TiCN in this work is too much higher than those reported in the literature by similar works. AFM and nanoindentation results showed that a TiCN coating with thickness of 1.6 μm and roughness of 22 nm exhibits a hardness of 3552 HV which is much higher than those hardnesses reported in previous works. The wear tests showed that the deposited TiCN coating has a higher wear resistance than the D2 steel as well as TiN coating; this better performance is attributed to the modifications made in the coating process and its nanoscale characters.","Shafyei, Hossein;Ashiri, Rouholah",2019-08-15,Ceramics International,"TiCN coating,EB-PVD,D2 tool steel,Topography,Roughness,Nanoindentation,Wear resistance,Nanograined structure,Nanoscale smoothness",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.213,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.213

Characterization of the coatings was performed by gravimetry, scanning electron microscopy, electron probe microanalysis, glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermodynamic simulations using the CALPHAD method, Rockwell C indentation and nanoindentation. The layered arrangement improves the oxidation resistance of TiN under the working conditions of steam power plants, as well as the mechanical properties of CrN. The produced architectures performance under the described working conditions boosts the understanding of the processes taking place at high temperature, making possible the design of optimal coatings combining the best behavior of both nitrides for each specific application, reaching a corrosion protection at high temperature in water vapor comparable to that of CrN and a hardness and Young's modulus as high as those of TiN.","Mato, S.;Sánchez-López, J.C.;Barriga, J.;Pérez, F.J.;Alcalá, G.",2020-10-09,Ceramics International,"Coatings' design,Steam oxidation,Diffusion kinetics,Thermal analysis,X-ray diffraction,Nanoindentation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.003

For this purpose, both copper and aluminum nitrates (Cu (NO3)2·3H2O and Al (NO3)3·9H2O) are used as oxidizers. Also, urea and graphite are respectively used as fuel to synthesize the Cu-Al2O3 nanocomposite and as inhibitor to prevent the oxidation of the synthesized copper. The microstructure and morphology of the nanocomposite coating, which includes 25wt% alumina as the reinforcing phase, was studied using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy at different fuel/oxidizer ratios ranging from 0.9 to 2. The temperature variation during the process was measured as a function of time using a precise thermocouple. Finally, micro-hardness and wear tests were conducted on the nanocomposite coating. The results verified the formation of Cu-Al2O3 nanocomposite coating. Time-temperature curve illustrated that the highest temperature was achieved at the fuel/oxidizer ratio of 1.25. The results of the microhardness and wear resistance test showed that these properties depend heavily on the fuel/oxidizer ratio, with the best condition attained at the ratio of 1.25.","Mohammadi, E.;Nasiri, H.;Khaki, J.

Lightweight design of bauxite-SiC composite refractories as the lining of rotary cement kiln using alternative fuels,"To meet the demand of energy-saving and adapt to the change from coal to the alternative fuel in the rotary cement kiln, bauxite-SiC refractories were fabricated by the incorporation of silica sol coated lightweight mullite aggregates in order to achieve low thermal conductivity and superior alkali vapor attack resistance simultaneously. Furthermore, the mechanism of resistance to alkali vapor attach was investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results showed that the thermal conductivity of bauxite-SiC specimens decreased gradually with increasing amounts of silica sol coated lightweight mullite aggregates while changes in the alkali vapor attach were not detectable. The shell-covered structure with a silica sol coating on the surface of lightweight aggregates hindered alkali vapor diffusion into the aggregates at high temperature. Bauxite-SiC refractories possessed lower thermal conductivity, superior alkali attack resistance and higher mechanical properties compared with the specimens which contained pristine lightweight aggregates.","Ren, Bo;Li, Yawei;Sang, Shaobai;Jin, Shengli",2017-10-01,Ceramics International,"Bauxite-SiC composite refractories,Silica sol coating,Lightweight mullite aggregate,Thermal conductivity,Alkali vapor attack resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.148,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.148
The effect of sintering temperature on the microstructure and phase transformation in tetragonal YSZ and LZ/YSZ composites,"In this paper, the effect of sintering temperature on the microstructure and phase transformation in lanthanum zirconate/yttria stabilized zirconia (LZ/YSZ) composites was studied. The phase stability of tetragonal YSZ was found to be decreased with the increase in sintering temperature along with the increase in volume fraction of LZ in LZ/YSZ composites. The addition of LZ in YSZ resulted in the phase transformation from tetragonal YSZ to monoclinic YSZ at high temperatures. Minor fraction of monoclinic phase was found in YSZ matrix of 30LZ and 50LZ composites after sintering at 1473K for 200h. The fraction of cubic phase was also found to increase with the increase in sintering time and temperature. However, no correlation of cubic phase was found to exist with the addition of LZ content. Coherent growth between LZ/YSZ interface was observed using transmission electron microscopy. Due to different expansion coefficients of LZ and YSZ, the largest thermal stress appeared (during cooling process) across the LZ/YSZ interface. Thermal stress promoted the phase transformation (tetragonal to monoclinic) in YSZ and distorted the grains. In LZ/YSZ composites, the average tensile stress increased with the increase in LZ content and temperature. At all sintering temperatures, the YSZ exhibited tensile stress while a compressive stress exited in LZ matrix. In all three (30LZ, 50LZ and 70LZ) composites, the maximum average stress was present in the LZ/YSZ matrix at sintering temperature of 1675K.","Liu, X.Y.;Wang, X.Z.;Javed, A.;Zhu, C.;Liang, G.Y.",2016-02-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Sintering temperature,Microstructure,Phase stability,LZ/YSZ composites",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.10.046,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.10.046
Structure and thermal conductivity of yttria-stabilized hafnia ceramic coatings grown on nickel-based alloy,"Yttria-stabilized hafnia (YSH) coatings were produced by sputter-deposition onto nickel (Ni) based super alloy substrates. The deposition was made by varying the growth temperature from room-temperature (RT) to 500°C. The microstructure and thermal properties of the YSH coatings were evaluated employing grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) and phot-acoustic measurements. GIXRD studies indicate that the coatings grown at RT are amorphous while those grown at 300°C and higher are crystalline. The crystalline YSH coatings crystallize in cubic hafnia phase and exhibit slightly enhanced lattice parameter compared to pure hafnia. The average grain size increases with increasing growth temperature. Thermal measurements indicate an effective reduction in thermal conductivity of YSH coatings compared to pure hafnia.","Noor-A-Alam, M.;Ramana, C.V.",2012-05-31,Ceramics International,"C.

"Characteristics of TiAlCN ceramic coatings prepared via pulsed-DC PACVD, part I: Influence of precursors’ ratio","In this study, titanium aluminium carbonitride (TiAlCN) ceramic coatings with different precursors' ratio of AlCl3/TiCl4 were deposited on H13 hot work tool steel substrates, using pulsed-DC plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition method. The coatings showed a nanocomposite microstructure consisted of fcc-TiAlN and hcp-AlN nanocrystalline grains and an amorphous carbon phase. Increasing the precursors' ratio from 0.5 to 3 led to an increase in Al content from ∼10 to ∼42 at.%. Moreover, with increasing the precursors' ratio, the surface roughness of the coating reduced initially from 21.39 to 14.44 nm, due to the creation of more nuclei of AlN and then it rose up to 18.26 nm. Coating with the precursors' ratio of 0.5 presented the highest microhardness of 3840 HV0.01,due to the less amount of chloride impurity and hcp-AlN phase. The precursors’ ratio of 0.5 resulted in the highest wear resistance and lowest coefficient of friction of around 0.17.","Rashidi, Mahshid;Tamizifar, Morteza;Ali Boutorabi, Seyyed Mohammad",2020-02-01,Ceramics International,"PACVD,TiAlCN coatings,Nanocomposites,Tribological properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.303,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.303
High stability of silica-wrapped CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots for light emitting application,"Encapsulating quantum dots (QDs) into other medium has been considered as an efficacious method to avoid the fluorescence degradation of QDs. Here, we proposed a facile method to embed CsPbBr3 perovskite QDs in silica matrix derived from (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) at room temperature in open air. The QDs/SiO2 composite was extracted from the sol-gel solution by using a precipitation-encapsulation method assisted with APTES. As-prepared composite powder possess a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 68% and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of ~23 nm. The QDs/SiO2 compounds show excellent stability after the five heating cycles (105 °C) and a continuous xenon irradiation (500 W, 70 °C). Besides, the products remain 94.3% and 98.6% photoluminescence (PL) intensity after 30 days of storage (25 °C) and 96 h of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation (λ = 365 nm) respectively. The white light-emitting diode (LED) was fabricated by coating green-emitting CsPbBr3@SiO2 composite powder and commercial red phosphors on blue chip. The fabricated white LED performed excellent light characteristics with a luminous efficacy (ηL) of 58.9 lmW-1 and a correlated color temperature (CCT, Tc) of 5829 K (current = 20 mA), it also display a wide color gamut with 126.8% of National Television System Committee (NTSC) color triangle area.","Cao, Peiyuan;Yang, Bobo;Zheng, Fei;Wang, Li;Zou, Jun",2020-02-15,Ceramics International,"Perovskite QDs,CsPbBr3,SiO2,Stability,White LED",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.114,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.114
The kinetics and mechanism of combusted Zr–B–Si mixtures and the structural features of ceramics based on zirconium boride and silicide,"The study focuses on investigation of the combustion kinetics and mechanisms, as well as the phase- and structure formation processes, during elemental synthesis of ceramics based on zirconium diboride and silicide doped with aluminum. The effect of the degree of dilution with an inert component and initial temperature T0 on the combustion kinetics of the Zr–Si–Al–B mixture is studied. An increase in T0 in the range of 298–700K causes a directly proportional rise in the combustion temperature Tc and rate Uc, which demonstrates that staging of the reactions of formation of zirconium boride and silicide remains invariant. The effective activation energy Eeff of the combustion process is 225kJ/mol, suggesting that the liquid-phase processes have a decisive effect on the reaction kinetics. The interaction of zirconium with boron and silicon runs through the Zr–Si–Al–B melt that is formed in the combustion zone. Staging of chemical transformations during phase and structure formation of SHS products is studied. The primary ZrB2 grains crystallize from the melt in the combustion zone; the ZrSi silicide phase is formed with a delay of no longer than 0.5s. Compact ceramics with composition ZrB2–ZrSi–ZrSi2–ZrSiAl2 synthesized by forced SHS- pressing showing a great potential for high-temperature applications both as a construction material and as a precursor for ion-plasma deposition of coatings.","Pogozhev, Yu.S.;Iatsyuk, I.V.;Potanin, A.Yu.;Levashov, E.A.;Novikov, A.V.;Kochetov, N.A.;Kovalev, D.Yu.",2016-11-15,Ceramics International,"Combustion,Kinetics,Mechanism,Structure formation,Zirconium diboride,Zirconium silicide",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.157,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.157
A novel combination of precursor pyrolysis assisted sintering and rapid sintering for construction of multi-composition coatings to improve ablation resistance of SiOC ceramic modified carbon fiber needled felt preform composites,"A double-layer coating composed of MoSi2–SiO2–SiC/ZrB2–MoSi2–SiC was designed and successfully constructed by a novel combination of precursor pyrolysis assisted sintering and rapid sintering to improve the ablation resistance of SiOC ceramic modified carbon fiber needled felt preform composites (CSs). The ZrB2–MoSi2–SiC inner layer coating was in relatively uniform distribution in the zone of 0–3 mm from the surface of CSs through the slurry/precursor infiltration in vacuum and SiOC precursor pyrolysis assisted sintering, which played a predominant role in improving oxidation and ablation resistance and maintaining the morphology of CSs. The MoSi2–SiO2–SiC outer layer coating was prepared by the spray and rapid sintering to further protect CSs from high-temperature oxidation. The ablation resistance of CSs coated with double-layer coating was evaluated by an oxygen-acetylene ablation test under the temperature of 1600–1800 °C with different ablation time of 1000 and 1500 s. The results revealed that the mass recession rates increased with the rise of ablation temperature and extension of ablation time, ranging from 0.47 g/(m2·s) to 0.98 g/(m2·s) at 1600–1800 °C for 1000 s and from 0.72 g/(m2·s) to 0.86 g/(m2·s) for 1000–1500 s at 1700 °C, while the linear recession rates showed negative values at 1700 °C due to the formation of oxides, such as SiO2 and ZrO2. The ablation mechanism of the double-layer coating was analyzed and found that a SiO2–ZrO2–Mo4.8Si3C0.6 oxidation protection barrier would be formed during the ablation process to prevent the oxygen diffusion into the interior CSs, and this study provided a novel and effective way to fabricate high-temperature oxidation protective and ablation resistant coating.","Sun, Yueqi;Dong, Shun;Hong, Changqing;Zhang, Xinghong;Han, Jiecai;Qu, Qiang",2020-08-15,Ceramics International,"Carbon fiber,Precursor pyrolysis assisted sintering,Rapid sintering,SiOC,Ablation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.094,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.094
Structural and electrical properties of the sol-gel derived multiferroic BiFeO3 monolayer and NiTiO3-BiFeO3 bilayer thin films,"In this paper, the multiferroic BeFiO3 monolayer and NiTiO3–BiFeO3 bilayer thin films were fabricated by spin-coating method on the SrRuO3/n+-Si substrate. The structural and ferroelectric properties of multiferroic BeFiO3 monolayer and NiTiO3–BiFeO3 bilayer thin films were investigated. Both multiferroic films showed the typical XRD patterns of the perovskite structure without presence of the second phase. The electrical properties, such as leakage current and remnant polarization, of the NiTiO3–BiFeO3 bilayer film were superior to those of BeFiO3 monolayer film, which those values were 1.94 × 10−4 A/cm2 at electric field of 0.75 MV/cm and 14.05 μC/cm2, respectively. This outcome is due to the NiTiO3–BiFeO3 bilayer film with a high Schottky barrier height as well as a top NiTiO3 layer on the BiFeO3 film inducing the strain-induced polarization rotation and forming the strong domain-wall pinning.","Chen, Ching-Hung;Her, Jim-Long;Pan, Tung-Ming",2020-06-15,Ceramics International,"Multiferroic,BiFeO3,NiTiO3–BiFeO3,Monolayer,Bilayer,Sol-gel method",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.097,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.097
Processing of alumina-coated tetragonal zirconia materials and their response to sliding wear,"Alumina-coated tetragonal zirconia stabilised with 3mol% of Y2O3 (YTZP) specimens (30mm×30mm×6mm) have been obtained by dipping of pre-sintered YTZP compacts in alumina suspensions and subsequent sintering. The coated specimens present hardness values and a wear resistance similar to those of reference dense alumina specimens and significantly higher than those of the YTZP substrates. The optimisation of the processing parameters is described. First, YTZP compacts with different open porosity levels were fabricated by colloidal filtration and subsequent thermal treatment at temperatures ranging from 1100 to 1400°C. Coated compacts were obtained by dipping the porous ones in alumina suspensions prepared in ethanol with two different solid loadings: 3 and 10vol.%, during immersion times up to 40min. Sintering (1500°C–2h) of the coated compacts was performed and microstructural analysis allowed the selection of the optimum porosity levels for the YTZP substrates and dipping conditions. For the optimised conditions, YTZP plates (30mm×30mm×6mm) were coated and the thermal treatment to reach densification of the substrate and the coating was optimised. Relatively thick coatings (≅200μm) were obtained. Hardness and wear resistance were evaluated for sintered monolithic and coated YTZP compacts and an alumina reference material and the wear damage of the tested specimens was analysed.","Bueno, S.;Ferrari, B.;Melandri, C.;de Portu, G.;Baudín, C.",2010-07-31,Ceramics International,"A.

"Effects of prestrain applied to poly(ethylene terephthalate) substrate before coating of indium–tin–oxide film on film quality and optical, electrical, and mechanical properties","Four kinds of poly(ethylene terephalate) (PET)/indium–tin–oxide (ITO) specimen were prepared to examine the effect of prestrain applied to the PET substrate before the coating of ITO film on the mechanical, microstructure, optical, and electrical properties and morphology. The dependence and interaction among these properties/parameters are established and discussed. The mean slenderness ratio of the crystalline porosities in the ITO film decreased with increasing prestrain. The tilt angle of tubular porosities increased due to the increase in the particle size of ITO deposited on the PET substrate. A nonzero prestrain reduced both interplanar spacing (d-spacing) and the mean surface roughness of the ITO film. An increase in the substrate prestrain decreased the mean transmittance but increased the mean reflectance of the specimens. An increase in the ITO particle size lowered the optical band gap (Eg) and mean reflection and increased the mean transmittance. PET/ITO specimens with larger Eg values had higher carrier mobility (Mb). A nonzero prestrain leads to a smooth ITO film with low electrical resistance. Decreasing Young's modulus in combination with increasing specimen's hardness is helpful to the increase in the pop-in depth and the decrease in the pop-out depth in the nanoindentations. The electrical current–depth curve from nanoindentation tests and the stress–depth curve can be used to efficiently identify the depths of pop-in and pop-out. The PET/ITO specimen with 2% prestrain had the largest pop-in depth and the smallest pop-out depth.","Li, Tse-Chang;Chung, Chung-Jen;Han, Chang-Fu;Hsieh, Po-Tsung;Chen, Kuan-Jen;Lin, Jen-Fin",2014-01-31,Ceramics International,"Prestrain,Carrier mobility,Band gap,Pop-in depth",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.06.040,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.06.040
Synthesis and thermophysics properties of ferroelastic SmNb1-XTaXO4 ceramics,"Monoclinic phase SmNb1-XTaXO4 ceramics are synthesized via solid-state reaction. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectra are applied to characterize the crystal structure. The ferroelasticity of SmNb1-XTaXO4 ceramics is confirmed by the domain structure observed via scanning electron microscopy. The band gap of SmNb1-XTaXO4 ceramics ranges from 4.3 to 5.0 eV and they exhibit excellent absorption for UV light. Thermophysics properties including specific heat, thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity and thermal expansion coefficients of SmNb1-XTaXO4 ceramics are investigated systematically. The result shows that the thermal conductivity of SmNb1-XTaXO4 ceramics is as low as 1.33 W m−1 K−1 (900 °C) and the thermal expansion coefficients are as high as 11.7 × 10−6 K−1 (1200 °C).

Multiferroic behavior of heterostructures composed of lanthanum and bismuth ferrite,"Heterostructured thin films of lanthanum ferrite (LFO) and bismuth ferrite (BFO) with different thicknesses were successfully obtained by a soft chemical method. The films were deposited by spin-coating and annealed at 500°C for 2h. The XRD pattern confirmed the purity of the thin films, where no additional peaks associated with impurity phases were present. The morphology analysis showed spherical grains with a random size distribution. The grain sizes increased with the number of BFO layers. The average grain size varied from 43nm to 68nm. The best dielectric results were obtained for the film with 6 LFO sublayers and 4 BFO top layers, in which the dielectric constant showed low dispersion. Since the capacitance-voltage curve for the film 6-LFO/4-BFO is symmetrical around null voltage, it can be inferred that this heterostructure has few mobile ions and accumulated charges on the film-substrate interface. In this film, polarization remains almost constant during 1012 cycles before the onset of degradation, which shows the very high resistance of the films to fatigue. Magnetoelectric coefficient measurements of the films revealed the formation of hysteresis loops, and a maximum value of 12V/cmOe was obtained for the magnetoelectric coefficient in the longitudinal direction; this value is much higher than that previously reported for pure BFO thin films.","Ortega, P.P.;Rocha, L.S.R.;Silva, C.C.;Cilense, M.;Amoresi, R.A.C.;Longo, E.;Simões, A.Z.",2016-11-15,Ceramics International,"A.

Tribological behaviour of RF-magnetron sputter deposited hydroxyapatite coatings in physiological solution,"The aim of the paper is to explore the tribological performance of hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings deposited by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering on AZ31 magnesium alloy (96% Mg, 3% Al, 0.7% Zn, 0.3% Mn) for biomedical applications. In this study, the position of the samples on a substrate holder, relative to a target erosion zone was taken into consideration in order to elucidate its impact on the coating characteristics, such as composition, morphology, surface topography and tribology. Substrate rotation and arc-movement were foreseen in the experimental set-up to increase the uniformity of thin film properties. The deposited HA thin films were revealed to exhibit an increase of the Ca/P ratio from 1.83 to 1.97, a decrease of (002) texture and thickness, as the samples were shifted towards the target erosion zone. By coatings, the roughness of Mg alloy was decreased (Ra Mg alloy=31.3nm; Ra coating=29nm and 21nm). The coating placed in the centre of the substrate holder showed high hardness and Young's modulus (H =8.3±0.9GPa; E=89±10GPa) than the coating prepared under the target erosion zone (H =6.9±1.1GPa; E=75±6GPa). The coating deposited under target erosion zone exhibits superior friction behaviour in simulated body fluid environment, with the friction coefficient (μ) of 0.184, while the sample located in the centre of the substrate holder possesses the friction coefficient (0.306) comparable to the AZ31 substrate (0.307). The low wear rate was determined in the case of coating deposited under target erosion zone (4.83×10−5 mm3 N−1 m−1) than uncoated AZ31 substrate (0.00518mm3 N−1 m−1) or than coating placed in the centre of the substrate holder (0.00294mm3 N−1 m−1).","Dinu, Mihaela;Ivanova, Anna A.;Surmeneva, Maria A.;Braic, Mariana;Tyurin, Alexander I.;Braic, Viorel;Surmenev, Roman A.;Vladescu, Alina",2017-06-15,Ceramics International,"A: Films,C: Friction, Wear resistance,D: Apatite,E: Biomedical applications",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.02.106,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.02.106
Single step formation of indium and tin doped ZnO nanowires by thermal oxidation of indium–zinc and tin–zinc metal films: Growth and optical properties,"Single step transformation of indium–zinc and tin–zinc films into doped ZnO nanowires is demonstrated. In and Sn doped ZnO nanowires are formed by the annealing of In–Zn and Sn–Zn bilayer films to 500°C in air. The nanowires of 15–100nm diameter and lengths up to 2µm are formed by the self-catalysis mechanism. Thus, by a single step annealing process doped ZnO nanowires can be realized. Independent of processing conditions all the nanostructures are polycrystalline as evidenced from x-ray diffraction patterns. The optical transmission, reflectance and absorption, in the wavelength range between 200 and 2500nm, have been measured as a function of annealing temperature. It is shown that all the bilayers and the In and Sn doped nanowires can be used as solar absorber materials due to their high absorption, low transmittance and reflectance, in this region of the spectrum. In certain cases, the nanowires exhibit high transmittance and very low reflectance making them very attractive for use as anti-reflection coatings.","Shaik, Ummar Pasha;Krishna, M.

In vitro biocompatibility of a nanocrystalline β-Ta2O5 coating for orthopaedic implants,"To improve the durability and bioactivity of Ti–6Al–4V alloy used for medical implants, the β-Ta2O5 nano-crystalline coatings were introduced using double cathode glow discharge technique. The coating microstructure was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The coating exhibits an assembly of near-equiaxed grains, locally aligned normal to the coating surface. The β-Ta2O5 coating exhibits strong adhesion to substrate and a strong resistance to deformation and cracking under applied loads. Cells culture tests showed that the coating is more beneficial to the adhesion and proliferation of NIH-3T3 cells as compared to the uncoated alloy. In-vitro bioactivity was evaluated by immersion of the coating in simulated body fluids (SBF) for different periods up to 14 days at 37°C. The results indicated that bioactivity of Ti–6Al–4V was dramatically improved after the deposition of β-Ta2O5, since the coating has a higher apatite forming ability than the Ti–6Al–4V substrate. Finally, the electrochemical behavior of the β-Ta2O5 coating after soaking in SBF at 37°C for 0, 3, 7, and 14 days was studied through potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). EIS measurements also confirm that the presence of a hydroxyapatite layer on the coating becomes thicker and denser during soaking in SBF. Moreover, the coating exhibits better corrosion resistance than the bare alloy. Hence, the β-Ta2O5 coating is a promising candidate coating for protection of orthopedic implants with enhanced bioactivity and corrosion resistance.","Xu, Jiang;Bao, Xi ke;Fu, Tao;Lyu, Yinghai;Munroe, Paul;Xie, Zong-Han",2018-04-01,Ceramics International,"Tantalum oxides,Bioactivity,Cytocompatibility,Corrosion resistance,Mechanical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.040,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.040
Relationship between mechanical properties and microstructure of yttria stabilized zirconia ceramics densified by spark plasma sintering,"Porous ceramics are widely used for many applications such as filters, insulators, electrodes for SOFC, membranes or bone scaffolds, with porosity in the typically range of 20–50%vol. The functionality of those materials comes at the expense of the degradation of their mechanical properties which are highly impacted by the rate, distribution, shape and size of the porosity. Among them tetragonal stabilized zirconia (TSZ) is one of the most industrially used; it is sometime called: “the ceramic steel” since in its dense state it exhibits the highest toughness for ceramics. It is known that the porosity has a huge impact on the thermo-mechanical properties of refractory ceramics as Yittria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ). This study aims to capitalize the mechanical properties as a function of porosity to provide future applications and ensure the behavior in service of thermal barrier coating. In the present paper, the correlation between the microstructure and the mechanical properties such as Young modulus, hardness and strength of YSZ ceramics obtained by Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) was investigated. Two types of YSZ powder, a nanometric one from Tosoh and a micrometric one obtained by sol-gel route were studied to prepare homogeneous mesoporous or oriented macroporous microstructure by partial sintering. SPS parameters have been determined and optimized to manage the porosity rate. Furthermore, a bimodal microstructure can be obtained, by mixing both powders, allowing the formation of linking bridges between the microporous zone and the nanopowder during sintering. The macroporous ceramics have lower Young modulus, hardness and strength than mesoporous ones. These characteristics are discussed in the paper taking into account the differences between microstructure and contacts between particles with various form factors. Thus, it is clearly evidenced that the morphology of raw powders and the level of porosity are key parameters to optimize the mechanical properties of such porous material.","Fregeac, Arnaud;Ansart, Florence;Selezneff, Serge;Estournès, Claude",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"YSZ,Spark plasma sintering,Fracture surface,Mechanical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.090,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.090
Surface morphology and microstructure evolution of B4C ceramic hollow microspheres prepared by wet coating method on a pyrolysis substrate,"B4C hollow microspheres have been proposed as one of the promising ignition capsules for inertial confinement fusion (ICF). It is worth noting that the selection of easier-to-remove substrate materials is the key to obtaining B4C hollow microspheres. In this work, B4C core-shell microspheres with a uniform structure are prepared by the wet coating method on a PAMS substrate. After the calcination, the complete thermal decomposition of the PAMS substrate leads to a hollow structure B4C ceramic microsphere. The effects of solid content of coating slurry on the morphology and microstructure of the B4C core-shell microspheres were investigated in detail. The result shows that the spacing of the B4C particles in the slurry gradually decreases with increasing the solid content, resulting in an increase in the surface tension of the slurry and an improved stabilization, which helps to optimize the surface roughness and sphericity of the B4C microspheres.","Chen, Ruichong;Qi, Jianqi;Guo, Xiaofeng;Ye, Diyin;Wang, Xiuling;Shi, Qiwu;Wu, Di;Liao, Zhijun;Lu, Tiecheng",2019-04-15,Ceramics International,"B4C ceramic hollow microspheres,ICF capsule,Morphology,Microstructure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.103,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.103
Evolution of internal cracks and residual stress during deposition of TBC,"Thermal barrier coating (TBCs) are ceramic coatings that are deposited on metallic substrates to provide high thermal resistance. Residual stress is among the critical factors that affect the performance of TBCs. It evolves during the process of coating deposition and in-service loading. High residual stresses result in significant cracking and premature delamination of the TBC layer. In the present study, a hybrid computational approach is used to predict the evolution of internal cracks and residual stress in TBC. Smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is first used to model the deposition of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) layer that contains various interfaces and micropores on a steel substrate. Then, three-dimensional (3D) finite element analysis is utilized to predict the evolution of internal cracks and residual stress in the ceramic coating layer. It is found that multiple cracks emerge during the solidification of the coating layer due to the development of high tensile (quenching) stresses. The cracking density is higher at regions near the coating interface. It is also found that compressive (residual) stresses are developed when the deposited coating is cooled to room temperature. The residual stress state is equibiaxial and nonlinear across the thickness/width of the TBC layer. The residual stress profile predicted compares well with that of hole drilling experiments.","Abubakar, Abba A.;Arif, Abul Fazal M.;Akhtar, S.

In-situ investigation of martensitic transformation toughening with electron backscatter diffraction and nano-indentation,"Quantitative and direct evidence for tetragonal to monoclinic martensitic transformation toughening was revealed by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and in-situ nanoindentation, using plasma-sprayed 3 mol% Y2O3–ZrO2 coatings. On the basis of EBSD phase distribution, four zooms with different phase compositions and microstructure were selected. The tetragonal grains, which were surrounded by large pores, completely transformed into a monoclinic phase, but were then crushed when subjected to a loading of 10 mN. Moreover, the critical excitation stress σc for the martensitic transformation was estimated to be about 4.2 GPa. According to the displacement curves, the ratio of reduced modulus to hardness (E r /H), which directly indicates the toughness of a material, was quantitively calculated. This experimentally demonstrated that both the elastic and plastic deformation capacity of the partially transformed grain were significantly improved, compared with the untransformed tetragonal grains. These findings will provide a fundamental insight into martensitic transformation toughening.","Wang, Yongzhe;Kong, Mingguang;Khan, Matiullah;Jimei, Zhang;Zeng, Yi",2018-10-15,Ceramics International,"ZrO2 coating,Martensitic transformation,Electron backscatter diffraction,Nanoindentation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.043,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.043
Large scale ZnO nanorod-based UV sensor induced by optimal seed layer,"Due to various effective parameters involved in synthesis process, the fabrication of large-scale, uniform, and high performance nanostructure-based UV sensor has recently been a challenge for practical applications. Here, we solve the problem by employing central composite rotatable design (CCRD) to generate an experimental program to offer data for modelling the individual and interactive effects of different parameters on UV sensing properties. In this work, large-scale and highly uniform ZnO nanorods (NRs) were hydrothermally grown on the glass substrate. Applying CCRD methodology, the substrates were pre-coated with different seed layers by dip-coating technique. Using counter and surface plots and also AFM, FE-SEM, and XRD analysis, the role of seed layer on nucleation mechanism, morphological, structural and UV sensing of ZnO NRs are systematically discussed. In addition, it has been found that the seed layer prepared under precursor concentration of 0.45M, withdrawal speed of 3.5cmmin−1, dip-coating numbers of 3, and annealing temperature of 400°C provides the best conditions for growing UV-sensitive ZnO NRs with optimal seed layer. Moreover, calculating lack-of-fit, pure errors, and coefficient of determination shows that the model has appropriate goodness-of-fit and repeatability. Our study is expected to pave a way for the growth of large scale NR-based UV sensors with optimum sensitivity and responsivity.","Akhtarianfar, Seyed Farshad;Khayatian, Ali;Almasi-Kashi, Mohammad",2016-09-30,Ceramics International,"ZnO nanorod,Ultraviolet sensor,Seed layer,Experimental design,Dip-coating method,Hydrothermal growth",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.123,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.123
Cathodic plasma electrolytic deposition of ZrO2/YSZ doped Al2O3 ceramic coating on TiAl alloy,"ZrO2/yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) doping Al2O3 ceramic coating was fabricated via cathodic plasma electrolytic deposition (CPED) technique. The microstructures and the chemical and phase compositions of the doped coating were characterized, the mechanical properties and the high temperature oxidation resistance were evaluated, and the doping mechanism was also discussed in detail. The results showed that, doped Zr4+ and Y3+ ions could effectively reduce the working voltage during CPED process and increase the content of metastable γ-Al2O3 in the coating. Accordingly, the doped ZrO2/YSZ significantly refined the grain size of Al2O3, as well as remarkably improved the high temperature oxidation resistance, the micro-structural compactness and hardness of the Al2O3 CPED coating. This study displayed here constructed an efficiently method for the fabrication of multifunctional coating on the surface of TiAl alloy.","Wang, Shaoqing;Xie, Faqin;Wu, Xiangqing;Ma, Yong;Du, Haoxuan;Wu, Gang",2019-10-15,Ceramics International,"Doping,ZrO2/YSZ,Al2O3 coating,TiAl alloy,CPED",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.125,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.125
Evaluation of microstructure and electrochemical behavior of dual-layer NiCrAlY/mullite plasma sprayed coating on high silicon cast iron alloy,"Protective single-layer mullite and dual-layer NiCrAlY/mullite coatings were deposited on high silicon cast iron by plasma spraying process. The microstructure analysis showed that NiCrAlY layer with a thickness of 90±19µm as bond coat and the nano-structured mullite layer with a thickness of 163±23µm as a top coat formed homogeneously on the surface of high silicon cast iron. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicate amorphous phases as a result of rapid cooling of molten particles. The microhardness of mullite layer in dual-layer NiCrAlY/mullite coating was significantly higher than bond coat and substrate. In addition, the corrosion behavior of the samples was comparatively studied using electrochemical tests. Polarization and EIS results showed that the uncoated sample has not suitable corrosion resistance in 3.5% NaCl solution due to the formation of micro-galvanic cells between graphite flakes and metal. However, its corrosion resistance was improved by the surface modification process. In the case of the coated samples, the dual-layer NiCrAlY/mullite coated sample exhibited better corrosion resistance due to the existence of a dense corrosion resistance bond coat and stronger bonding strength. Finally, the corrosion mechanisms for the mullite single-layer, NiCrAlY/mullite dual-layer, and uncoated samples were proposed.","Jam, Alireza;Derakhshandeh, Seyed Mohammad Reza;Rajaei, Hosein;Pakseresht, Amir Hossein",2017-11-30,Ceramics International,"Mullite,Corrosion,Plasma spray,Surfaces,Impedance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.155,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.07.155
Synthesis and characterization of Cu-/In-co-doped ZnS x Se1-x with tunable band-gaps as high near-infrared reflective color pigments,"A series of Cu-/In-co-doped ZnS x Se1-x pigments with various colors were synthesized via co-precipitation reaction and subsequent calcination. The results show that the color of Cu-/In-co-doped ZnS x Se1-x pigments can be adjusted at different Cu- and In-doping concentrations due to the change of the tunable band-gaps range from 2.68 eV to 2.13 eV. The absorption edge of as-synthesized pigments continuously shifts to a longer wavelength (i.e., 472–615 nm) when Cu- and In-doping concentrations increase. The pigment with a yellow color exhibits the maximum near-infrared (NIR) solar reflectance (R * = 86.65%) in the wavelength range of 700–2500 nm. It is also indicated that the surface temperature on aluminum plates with a solar reflective coating colored by the as-synthesized pigments with yellow and red colors can be reduced by 4.2–7.9 ℃.","Zhang, Ti;Wang, Yanmin;Pan, Zhidong",2018-10-15,Ceramics International,"ZnS x Se1-x,Cu-/In-co-doped,Tunable band-gap,Near-infrared reflectance,Cool pigment",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.120,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.120
"Influences of deposition temperature, gas flow rate and ZrC content on the microstructure and anti-ablation performance of CVD-HfC-ZrC coating","To amend the oxidation and ablation resistance of C/C composites, HfC-ZrC biphase coating was synthesized by CVD. Influences of deposition temperature and CH4 flow rate on the deposition rate, phase constitution and microstructure of the HfC-ZrC coating were investigated. Ablation behavior and ablation mechanism of the HfC-ZrC coating with different ZrC contents were examined. With the deposition temperature rising, the deposition rate and grain size of the HfC-ZrC coating increased. High flow rate of CH4 was beneficial to improving the deposition rate and reducing the grain size of the HfC-ZrC coating. Moderate ZrC content in the HfC-ZrC coating was conducive to the process of solid solution sintering among HfO2 and ZrO2 grains, leading to generating a continuous and compact oxide layer. The coating with HfC/ZrC mole ratio of 1:1 exhibited superior anti-ablation performance, owing to its flat and compact structure and sufficient solid solution sintering among the oxide grains during ablation.","Ren, Jincui;Feng, Errong;Zhang, Yulei;Zhang, Jian;Ding, Donghai;Li, Lu",2020-08-20,Ceramics International,"C/C composite,Ceramic coating,Microstructure,Ablation performance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.163,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.163
Protective properties of SiO2 with SiO2 and Al2O3 nanoparticles sol-gel coatings deposited on FeCrAl alloys,"Five layer SiO2 coatings containing SiO2 or Al2O3 nanopowders were deposited on FeCrAl alloy support by sol-gel method. Studies of protective properties of the coatings were carried out during high temperature cyclic oxidation. Changes in surface topography, structure and chemical composition of the surface layer of FeCrAl alloy were investigated. It has been shown that the type of nanofillers present in the SiO2 coating (about 2.5 wt%) affects morphology of Al2O3 growing scale and determines the heat resistance of FeCrAl alloy. The lowest relative mass change (approx. 1.3%) after 10 oxidation cycles in air at 900 °C (one cycle = 12 h) was measured for the samples with coatings containing hydrophilic nanosilica (Aerosil 380) as filler. The protective efficiency of the coatings in the process of high-temperature oxidation is from 66% to 85%. The thickness of the formed scale and the value of the parabolic rate constant depend on the type of nanopowder in the coating.","Chęcmanowski, Jacek G.;Szczygieł, Irena;Mazur, Anna;Szczygieł, Bogdan",2019-02-01,Ceramics International,"Sol-gel process,Composites,Corrosion,SiO2-Al2O3,Thermal applications,Coatings",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.295,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.295
Ablative property of ZrCSiC multilayer coating for PIP-C/SiC composites under oxy-acetylene torch,"To improve ablation resistance of PIP-C/SiC composites, ZrCSiC multilayer coating was prepared on surface of PIP-C/SiC composites by chemical vapor deposition and slurry. The coating shows dense surface and outstanding anti-ablation ability. Compare with uncoated PIP-C/SiC, the linear and mass ablation rates of the coated PIP-C/SiC decrease by 59.5% and 50.3%, respectively, after ablation for 30s. Large amounts of heat can be taken away by the gas generated during ablation, which is also helpful for protection for the composites.","Yang, Xiang;Wei, Li;Song, Wang;Zhao-hui, Chen",2012-05-31,Ceramics International,"PIP-C/SiC composites,Coating,ZrC,Ablation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.11.063,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.11.063
Interphase effects on the bend strength and toughness of an oxide fibre/oxide matrix composite,"The effect of alumina–20 wt.% ZrO2 (PRD-166) fibre and SnO2 coating properties on the bending strength and toughness of alumina fibre/SnO2/glass matrix composites have been investigated. The mean strength of as-received alumina–20 wt.% ZrO2 fibres was 1380 MPa for a gage length of 17 mm and decreased with increase in heat treatment temperatures. It was also observed that as the SnO2 coating thickness increased, roughness of the coating increased and this decreased the strength of the fibres. This roughness effect had serious implications on the fracture characteristics of PRD-166/SnO2/glass and Saphikon/SnO2/glass matrix composites. PRD-166/SnO2/glass matrix composites exhibited non-planar failure with fiber bridging and fibre debonding as major toughening mechanisms. Saphikon/SnO2/glass matrix composites failed in a tough manner with extensive fibre pullout. The difference in the failure mode between PRD-166/SnO2/glass and Saphikon/SnO2/glass matrix composites was attributed to the clamping stress associated with fiber roughness at the PRD-166/SnO2 interface as compared to the smoother Saphikon/SnO2 interface.","Venkatesh, Ramanan",2002-12-31,Ceramics International,"Interface effects,Bend strength,Toughness,Oxide fibre composite",10.1016/S0272-8842(02)00011-1,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0272-8842(02)00011-1
"Composition, structure and mechanical properties of the titanium surface after induction heat treatment followed by modification with hydroxyapatite nanoparticles","Coatings of titania (TiO2) and ""titania–hydroxyapatite"" were prepared by oxidation of commercially pure titanium VT1-00 using induction heat treatment (IHT), followed by modification with colloidal hydroxyapatite (HAp) nanoparticles. The IHT treatment was performed at temperatures within 600–1200°C for 300s. According to the results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray fluorescent analysis (EDX), nanoindentation and in vitro testing, titania coatings of high morphological heterogeneity, and high mechanical properties and biocompatibility were formed on the titanium surface after IHT. The coatings were found to consist of nano- and submicron crystals of oval, needle-like, plate and prismatic shapes. A subsequent modification with HAp nanoparticles of the coated titanium substrate leads to accelerated formation of mechanically strong oxidebioceramic composite coatings. It was established that the porous oxide coatings modified with nanoparticles of HAp that were formed at temperatures from 800 to 1000°C and holding for at least 30s had a high biocompatibility.","Fomin, Aleksandr;Dorozhkin, Sergey;Fomina, Marina;Koshuro, Vladimir;Rodionov, Igor;Zakharevich, Andrey;Petrova, Natalia;Skaptsov, Aleksandr",2016-07-31,Ceramics International,"Titania,Hydroxyapatite,Coatings,Induction heat treatment",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.03.213,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.03.213
Application of artificial neural networks to predict sliding wear resistance of Ni–TiN nanocomposite coatings deposited by pulse electrodeposition,"Ni–TiN composite coatings were prepared on 45 steel substrates by pulse electrodeposition. The effect of plating parameters on the sliding wear resistance of the Ni–TiN nanocomposite coatings was investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The sliding wear resistance of the Ni–TiN coatings was modeled using artificial neural networks (ANNs). TiN grains in Ni–TiN coatings were large when the average current density was relatively low and the pulse interval was long. At a given wear distance, with increasing TiN concentration in the bath, the wear loss of the coating initially decreased and subsequently increased. The average crystallite sizes for Ni and TiN in Ni–TiN coating were approximately 58 and 39nm, respectively. The ANN model, which showed an error of approximately 4.2%, can effectively predict sliding wear resistance of Ni–TiN nanocomposite coatings.","Li, Xingyuan;Zhu, Yongyong;Xiao, Guorong",2014-09-30,Ceramics International,"Application,Artificial neural networks,Ni–TiN coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.04.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.04.005
Effect of preparation route on the properties of slip-casted Al2O3/YAG composites,"Alumina composites containing 5, 10 and 20vol.% YAG were produced by a slip-casting process. Two different routes for adding the YAG phase were chosen. Either by mixing of alumina with previously produced YAG powder or by coating of an adequate amount of yttria to form YAG precipitates during the calcining step. The mechanical properties of the sintered samples were measured and compared. Independent from the preparation route Al2O3/10vol.% YAG composites showed best mechanical properties. Significant differences in the densification behavior appeared between the two different manufacturing technologies. The presence of intermediately formed phases like YAM and YAP during the powder preparation step of coated composites is probably the reason why mixed composites showed higher mechanical properties than coated composites.","Sommer, F.;Kern, F.;El-Maghraby, H.F.;El-Ezz, M.

Wear-resistant Ti–Al–Ni–C–N coatings produced by magnetron sputtering of SHS-targets in the DC and HIPIMS modes,"The hard wear-resistant nanocomposite Ti–Al–Ni–C–N coatings were deposited by direct current magnetron sputtering (DCMS) and high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HIPIMS) in the Ar, Ar+15%N2, and Ar+25%N2 atmospheres. The structure of coatings was analyzed using the X-ray diffraction analysis, glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Mechanical and tribological properties were measured using the nanoindentation and scratch testing as well as by tribological testing using the “pin-on-disc” scheme. Electrochemical corrosion resistance and oxidation resistance of coatings were investigated.

Protection of CK45 carbon steel tillage tools using TiN coating deposited by an arc-PVD method,Titanium nitride (TiN) was coated on tillage sweep duck blades by using an arc-PVD method to increase their useful lifetime and to protect against wear. The XRD and EDX experiments indicated high-quality crystalline TiN layers. The wear resistance of the blades was examined on a loamy agricultural field. The surface roughness and wear behavior of the coated blades were also studied at different travelling distances. The draft force of both coated and uncoated blades was measured in a soil bin.

Template effect in TiN/AlN multilayered coatings from first principles,"Multilayered TiN/AlN coatings find many technological applications where superhardness is suspected to be affected by AlN structures and template effect. Here, we demonstrate, by first-principles calculations on alternative adsorptions of Al and N atoms on Ti- and N-terminated TiN surfaces, that the preferred stacking sequences (i.e., having the largest adsorption energy) transform from fcc- to hcp- mode in first a few AlN layers. Using several analytic methods, we identify that for the T-terminated surface, the third added N layer is critical to inducing the structural transition of AlN, weakening the interaction between the second added Al and first added N atoms. The findings provide insight to the complicated template effects in TiN/AlN multilayered coatings, which are practically relevant for further improving property of multilayered coatings at the atomic scale.","Yin, Deqiang;Peng, Xianghe;Qin, Yi;Wang, Zhongchang",2015-09-30,Ceramics International,"TiN/AlN multilayered coatings,Template effect,First-principles",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.04.104,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.04.104
Tribological behaviour of atmospheric plasma and high velocity oxy-fuel sprayed WC-Cr3C2-Ni coatings at elevated temperatures,"The thermally-sprayed coatings extensively used in high temperatures application such as aerospace, power generation equipment, hot section components in gas and steam turbines. Most of the thermally sprayed WC based coatings lost the functional ability after 500 °C. Consequently, the work focuses on the development of WC based coatings which could sustain with excellent functional ability even above 500 °C. The unidirectional dry sliding wear of WC-Cr3C2-Ni coatings deposited by atmospheric plasma spray (APS) and high-velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) techniques have been relatively investigated up to 800 °C using ball-on-disc high-temperature tribometer (ASTM G99). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analyser (EDX) and Raman spectroscopy analysed the worn-out surface morphology, oxide content and phase transition. The detailed wear mechanisms at 300 °C, 500 °C and 700 °C were studied. Interestingly, the specific wear rates of both the coatings were declined after 500 °C. The study of the relationship between wear and tribo-oxidation process suggested that HVOF coatings inhibit the wear above 500 °C, due to development of tribo-film and well retained WC phase on the surface even at high temperature. The lubricous oxides WO3, NiWO4 and CrWO4, attributed to form a tribo-oxide film which resulted into superior wear resistance up to 800 °C. Nevertheless, specific wear rates for both coatings are in a mild regime which recommended that WC-Cr3C2-Ni coatings could be more durable up to 800 °C in the oxygen-enriched environments.","Bhosale, Digvijay G.;Rathod, Walmik S.",2020-06-01,Ceramics International,"Wear resistance,Carbides,Thermal applications",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.288,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.288

Impact of ZrO2 alloying on thermo-mechanical properties of Gd3NbO7,"The ZrO2 alloying effect is widely used to optimize the thermo-mechanical properties of potential thermal barrier coatings. In this study, dense x mol% ZrO2-Gd3NbO7 with C2221 space group were manufactured via a solid-state reaction. The crystalline structure was determined through X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, when the surface morphology was observed by scanning electron microscopy. ZrO2-Gd3NbO7 had identical orthorhombic crystal structures, and there was no second phase. The crystalline structure of ZrO2-Gd3NbO7 shrunk with the increasing ZrO2 content as indicated by XRD and Raman results. The heat capacity and thermal diffusivity of ZrO2-Gd3NbO7 were 0.31–0.43 J g−1 K−1 (25–900 °C) and 0.25–0.70 mm2/s (25–900 °C), respectively. It was found that ZrO2-Gd3NbO7 had much lower thermal conductivity (1.21–1.82 W m−1 K−1, 25–900 °C) than YSZ (2.50–3.00 W m−1 K−1) and La2Zr2O7 (1.50–2.00 W m−1 K−1). The thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) were higher than 10.60 × 10−6 K−1 (1200 °C), which were better than that of YSZ (10.00 × 10−6 K−1) and La2Zr2O7 (9.00 × 10−6 K−1). The mechanical properties of Gd3NbO7 change little with the increasing ZrO2 content, Vickers hardness was about 10 GPa, and Young's modulus was about 190 GPa, which was lower than YSZ (240 GPa). Compared with previous work about alloying effects, much lower thermal conductivity was obtained. Due to the high melting point, high hardness, low Young's modulus, ultralow thermal conductivity and high TECs, it is believed that ZrO2-Gd3NbO7 is promising TBCs candidate.","Wang, YiTao;Chen, Lin;Feng, Jing",2020-04-01,Ceramics International,"TBCs,Ceramics,Rare earth niobates,Alloying effects,Thermal conductivity,Young's modulus",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.084,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.084
Crystal structure and near-infrared reflective properties of Fe3+ doped AlPO4 pigments,"Novel non-toxic orange yellow inorganic pigments Al1−xFexPO4(x=0.00, 0.03, 0.05, 0.08) with high near-infrared reflectance (NIR) have been synthesized by a coprecipitation method. The structures of samples were investigated by XRD and Raman spectroscopy, and the reflective properties were tested by UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer. Results demonstrated that with more Fe3+ added, the color of the powder samples changed from white to orange yellow and the near-infrared reflectance decreased from 98.03% to 72.56%, which is higher than the commercial orange yellow pigment (61.99%). The near-infrared reflectance of corresponding coatings decreased from 69.35% to 59.10%, which is higher than the commercial coating with the similar color (51.88%). From the XRD diffraction spectrogram, we can see the peaks did not change with more Fe3+ added. However, because of ionic radius of Fe3+(0.63Å) is a little larger than Al3+(0.53Å), the cell volume increases a little when more Fe3+ is added. Furthermore, from the Raman spectrogram, we can see that doping with Fe3+, there is a new Raman peak which is assigned to the asymmetric [FeO4] stretch. In addition, replacing Fe3+ for Al3+ in AlPO4 caused the band gap decreased from 5.98eV to 3.60eV, which can cause the absorption of more near-infrared radiation and that is the reason of the decrease of near-infrared reflectance.","Shi, Yong;Zhong, Mingfeng;Zhang, Zhijie;Wang, Da",2017-06-01,Ceramics International,"Coprecipitation process,Inorganic pigments,Near-infrared reflectance,Cool colorants",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.01.131,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.01.131
Influence of fiber coating thickness on microstructure and mechanical properties of carbon fiber-reinforced zirconium diboride based composites,"Unidirectional carbon fiber-reinforced zirconium diboride based composites were fabricated by hot pressing. The fiber–matrix interface was tailored by pre-coating the as-received carbon fibers with pyrolytic carbon (PyC) coatings of various thickness or silicon carbide (SiC) coating. The effects of the interfacial characteristics on mechanical properties and microstructure of the composites were studied. The results indicated that both the composites reinforced with as-received carbon fibers and SiC coated carbon fibers showed inferior flexural strength and fracture toughness. With optimized PyC coating thickness, the mechanical properties of the composites had been remarkably improved, i.e. a flexural strength of 309.6MPa was achieved when the thickness of PyC coating was 0.1μm, and a fracture toughness of 6.72MPam1/2 was obtained when the PyC coating was 0.7μm thick.","Xiao, Kesong;Guo, Quangui;Liu, Zhanjun;Zhao, Song;Zhao, Yun",2014-01-31,Ceramics International,"B.

Amorphous zones in flame sprayed alumina–titania–zirconia compounds,"The formation of amorphous phases in thermally sprayed coatings is a common phenomenon. This work examines the distribution of the amorphous content in flame sprayed Al2O3–TiO2–ZrO2-compounds. An amorphous percentage appears even in pure alumina and the percentage increases with increasing amount of TiO2- and ZrO2-addition. Amorphous sub-lamellae appear in all examined compositions. If a system with a miscibility gap in the liquid state, such as Al2O3–ZrO2, is applied, the formation of secondary amorphous regions is observed. The amorphous sub-lamellae or primary amorphous region is induced only by rapid cooling, the secondary amorphous regions are induced by rapid cooling plus a spinodal demixing effect.","Kratschmer, Tim;Aneziris, Christos G.",2011-01-31,Ceramics International,"Thermal spray,Amorphous,Alumina,Titania,Zirconia",10.1016/j.ceramint.2010.09.020,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2010.09.020
Deposition and oxidation behaviour of molybdenum disilicide coating on Nb based alloys substrate by combined AIP/HAPC processes,"A MoSi2 coating was prepared on Nb-10Hf-1Ti alloys by a two-step process. The first step was arc ion plating (AIP) of the Mo layer, and the second step was halide-activated pack cementation (HAPC) of Si. The coating is composed of an outer layer of MoSi2 and an inner bond layer. After oxidation testing at 1200 °C for 100 h in a static air atmosphere, the mass gain of the coated specimen was 0.64 mg/cm2. The good oxidation resistance of the MoSi2 coating is attributed to the protective SiO2 scale generated by the oxidation process.","Liu, L.;Lei, H.;Gong, J.;Sun, C.",2019-06-01,Ceramics International,"Metal coatings,Superalloys,Oxidation,Microstructure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.115,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.115

Effects on Cu concentration in the formation of CCTS phase were systematically investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. Moreover, CCTS films, processed with the optimized Cu concentration (∼8 mmol) and annealing temperature of 575 °C in Ar ambient, exhibit the film morphology with compact, dense, and large grains up to the size of 1.5 μm. The resistivity (ρCCTS) of CCTS films on SLG and SiO2 substrates were extracted as 7.15 ± 0.18 Ωcm and 7.8 ± 0.19 Ωcm, respectively, denoting that surface roughness and sodium diffusion might affect electrical conductivity of CCTS films. Furthermore, for the optimized CCTS films, noticeable relative photosensitivity (Sph) up to 20% was achieved under red LED illumination, highlighting that CCTS films could be promising for cost-effective thin film solar cells.","Krishnaiah, Mokurala;Mishra, Rajneesh Kumar;Seo, Seung Gi;Jin, Sung Hun;Park, Jong Tae",2019-06-15,Ceramics International,"Cu2CoSnS4,Dimethylformamide,Direct solution coating,Annealing temperature,Electrical properties,Photosensitivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.167,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.167
Nitrogen-doped carbon decorated NaTi2(PO4)3 composite as an anode for sodium-ion batteries with outstanding electrochemical performance,"Nitrogen-doped carbon decorated NaTi2(PO4)3 composite (denoted as NaTiP/N-C) has been synthesized via a facile approach and tested as an anode for energy storage. In this structure, the N-carbon layer can not only act as a conductive coating but also as a supporting material to inhibit the volume expansion of NaTiP particles during the cycling process. Due to these advantages, the NaTiP/N-C exhibits excellent electrochemical properties including high discharge capacity, good rate performance and cyclic property. It can deliver high discharge capacities of 105.1 and 94.7 mAh g−1 at 4 and 6 C, respectively.

Effect of Na2SiO3·5H2O concentration on microstructure and mechanical properties of plasma electrolytic oxide coatings on AZ31 Mg alloy produced by twin roll casting,"In this study, AZ31 Mg alloys produced by twin roll casting (TRC) were coated by plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) in solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH) and different concentration of sodium metasilicate pentahydrate (Na2SiO3·5H2O) electrolytes at 0.140A/cm2 current density for 60min. The phase structure, morphology, hardness, adhesion strength, surface roughness and wear resistance of the PEO coatings were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), micro-hardness tester, micro-scratch tester, profilometer and tribometer, respectively. The XRD results indicated that Forsterite (Mg2SiO4) and Periclase (MgO) phases were formed on the surface of the coated magnesium alloys. The surface of the coatings is very porous and rough due to the presence of micro-discharges through PEO process. It was seen that the wear rate, hardness and surface roughness of the coatings were increased when the concentration of Na2SiO3·5H2O electrolyte was increased.","Aktuğ, Salim Levent;Durdu, Salih;Kutbay, Işıl;Usta, Metin",2016-01-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Construction of Er-doped ZnO/SiO2 composites with enhanced antimicrobial properties and analysis of antibacterial mechanism,"Herein, silica carrier was used as underlying structure to prepare composite material loaded with rare earth element Er and Zn. Rare earth elements can improve antimicrobial effects of ZnO due to their specific electronic structure. Er–ZnO/SiO2 hybrid antibacterial material was prepared through sol-gel method and its structure and morphology were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller measurements. E. coli and S. aureus were selected as model bacteria to assess antibacterial activity of prepared hybrid material by plate coating method. Er–ZnO/SiO2 exhibited good antibacterial activity towards E. coli and S. aureus. Increase in Er3+ concentration from 0.12% to 1.10% led to increase in antibacterial performance followed by subsequent decrease. Improving effect of Er relied on the molar ratio of Er doped in ZnO/SiO2 hybrid material. The optimal sample was found to be 0.60%Er–ZnO/SiO2, with antibacterial rates of 93.71% and 70.46% against E. coli and S. aureus, respectively. Antibacterial mechanism was assessed by fluorescence detection of reactive oxygen species. In addition, flame atomic absorption spectrometry was used to measure the amount of released Zn2+. Results also showed that 0.60%Er–ZnO/SiO2 hybrid material generated more reactive oxygen species, released more Zn2+ ions, and had the largest surface area, which improved its antibacterial rate. Thus, Er enhanced antibacterial properties of ZnO/SiO2, providing these composite materials with great potential as antibacterial products.","Yang, Sue;Nie, Yanli;Zhang, Bin;Tang, Xiaoning;Mao, Huaming",2020-09-30,Ceramics International,"Er-doped ZnO/SiO2 composites,Antibacterial activity,Mechanical and structural behavior,Rare earth dopant",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.149,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.149
Mechanical properties and oxidation resistance of SiCf/CVI-SiC composites with PIP-SiC interphase,"SiC coatings were successfully synthesized on SiC fibers by precursor infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP) method using polycarbosilane (PCS) as precursor. The morphology of as-fabricated coatings was observed by SEM, and its structure was characterized by XRD and Raman spectrum. The SiC fiber reinforced chemical vapor infiltration SiC (SiCf/CVI-SiC) composites with PIP-SiC coatings as interphase were fabricated. And, the effects of PIP-SiC interphase on mechanical properties of composites were investigated. The experimental results point out that the coating is smooth and there is little bridging between fibers. The coating is amorphous with SiC and carbon micro crystals. The flexural strength of composites with and without PIP-SiC interphase is 220 and 100MPa, respectively. And the composites with PIP-SiC interphase obviously exhibit a toughened fracture behavior. The oxidation resistance of composites with PIP-SiC interphase is much better than that of composites with pyrolytic carbon (PyC) interphase.","Ding, Donghai;Zhou, Wancheng;Luo, Fa;Chen, Malin;Zhu, Dongmei",2012-07-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Oxidation and ablation protection of graphite materials by monolayer MoSi2–CrSi2–SiC–Si multiphase coating,"A monolayer MoSi2–CrSi2–SiC–Si multiphase coating was designed and prepared by slurry impregnation combined with reactive infiltration of gaseous silicon onto a graphite substrate. The phase composition and microstructure of the as-prepared coating were studied by X-ray diffraction analysis and scanning electron microscopy. Oxidation and oxyacetylene flame tests were performed to evaluate the anti-oxidation and anti-ablation performance of the MoSi2-CrSi2-SiC-Si coating. Results showed that the as-prepared coating can withstand long–duration oxidation at low temperature (900 °C) for 1320 h and at high temperature (1600 °C) for 1190 h with mass gains of 0.06% and 1.24%, respectively. The compact structure of the coating, which had a thickness of approximately 600 µm, resulted in the excellent anti-oxidation behavior at 900 °C, whereas the excellent oxidation resistance at 1600 °C is attributed to the formation of an oxide layer with slow oxygen diffusivity on the coating surface and the presence of dispersed MoSi2 and CrSi2 in the coating. Further, the as-prepared coating displayed good ablation resistance, after ablation for 60 s, the mass and linear ablation rates of the coated sample were 0.31 mg/s and 0.33 µm/s, respectively. Under an oxyacetylene flame, active oxidation of silicon carbide and severe evaporation of oxides, for instance, gaseous silica, molybdenum oxide, and chromium trioxide, were the main causes of damage to the MoSi2–CrSi2–SiC–Si coating.","Jiang, Yan;Chang, Longfei;Ru, Hongqiang;Wang, Wei;Zhang, Cuiping",2018-11-30,Ceramics International,"Graphite,MoSi2–CrSi2–SiC–Si coating,Slurry impregnation,Reactive infiltration,Oxidation resistance,Ablation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.013
Re-understanding the function mechanism of surface coating: Modified Li-rich layered Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 cathodes with YF3 for high performance lithium-ions batteries,"As a promising positive electrode material for high energy lithium-ion batteries, Li-rich manganese based cathode materials (LNCM) have a capacity over 250 mA h g−1 but suffer from capacity fade and voltage decay during electrochemical cycling. Surface coating and bulk doping can improve the performance of LNCM from different aspects but both of them have shortcomings. Herein, we contrive to integrate the advantages of surface coating and bulk doping by YF3 modification. The phase transformation and gradient diffusion at the interface between the coating layer and bulk region were investigated by XRD, XPS, SEM, EDS and TEM. A LNCM material modified with 5 wt% YF3(0.05-YF3) shows an enhanced initial coulombic efficiency of 87.56% and an improved rate performance of 179.6 mA h g−1 at 5C compared to 76.94% and 148.3 mA h g−1 for the pristine, a discharge capacity of 217.9 mA h g−1 and a retention of 85.2% after 150 cycles at 0.5C compared to 161.2 mAhg−1,72.71% compared to the pristine. The improved performance can be attributed to the fact that part of Li2MnO3 had been activated during the YF3 modification and secondary calcination process, forming a spinel phase with three dimensional Li+ diffusion channels, which are beneficial to enhance rate performance. Besides, some F− ions diffused into the bulk region due to the gradient and bonded with TM, which are help to stabilize the structure. Further treatment at high temperature of the secondary calcination for the 0.05-YF3 modified materials show a lower voltage decay of 331.9 mV after 100 cycles at 0.5C compared to 608.6 mV for pristine, which further confirms the diffusion of F− and its effects on reducing the voltage decay and stabilizing the structure during cycling.","Niu, Bangbang;Li, Jianling;Liu, Yanying;Li, Zhanyu;Yang, Zhe",2019-06-15,Ceramics International,"Lithium-rich materials,Phase transformation,Gradient diffusion,YF3 modification",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.184,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.184
"Preparation, characterization and annealing behavior of nanostructured Al2O3 coating on quartz fiber by non-electrode plasma synthesis","In the present manuscript the patented non-electrode plasma electrolysis technique was successfully applied in order to deposit nano-structured Al2O3 ceramic coating on the quartz fiber. It was found that the grooves on the blank fiber were covered by Al2O3, accordingly decreasing the surface defects. In this case, the coating effectively improved the breaking strength of the quartz fiber at elevated temperatures. The coated fiber still exhibited relatively higher strength of 0.38 N/tex after annealing at 600 °C for 60 min, nearly three times as that of the blank fiber. Both the formation mechanism and the protection mechanism of the Al2O3 coating were systematically investigated. We believe that the non-electrode plasma electrolysis will find a wide range of applications in the surface modification of non-conductive fibers.","Xiang, Yan;Zhang, Yongfu;Bu, Aiming;Deng, Jingyu;Meng, Yang;Chen, Weiwei;Cheng, Huanwu;Wang, Lu;Lu, Lin;Li, Maoyuan",2019-08-15,Ceramics International,"Quartz fiber,Non-electrode plasma synthesis,Al2O3 coating,Breaking strength,Mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.056,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.056
Regenerating the used LiFePO4 to high performance cathode via mechanochemical activation assisted V5+ doping,"The wide usage of LiFePO4 batteries makes their recovery and recycling urgent. Here, a novel, efficient and environmentally friendly recycling process has been developed to recover high performance LiFePO4 nano composites from spent LiFePO4 materials. The process comprises an intensive mechanochemical activation through mixing with precursor mixture and one-step solid state heat treatment. Spent LiFePO4, V2O5, Li2CO3, and NH4H2PO4 are mixed according to the molar ratio of 1-xLiFePO4@xLi3V2(PO4)3 (x = 0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.03 and 0.1). In the typical process, the decomposition of self-contained binder and the conductive carbon provide a reducing environment as well as an in-situ coating carbon source. The SEM, XRD and XPS results illustrate that V5+ is doped in the Fe2+ site when x < 0.01, with co-existence of V5+ doping and Li3V2(PO4)3 when x ≥ 0.03. Sole V5+ doping assisted in-situ carbon coating displays the best electrochemical performance. The optimized sample shows discharge capacities of 154.3 mA h g−1 and 142.6 mA h g−1 at 0.1 and 1 C rates, respectively, with a high capacity retention of nearly ∼100% after 100 cycles. All results indicate that intensive mechanochemical activation assisted V5+ doping is a promising strategy for spent LiFePO4 recycling.","Xu, Bin;Dong, Peng;Duan, Jianguo;Wang, Ding;Huang, Xuesong;Zhang, Yingjie",2019-06-15,Ceramics International,"Lithium-ion batteries,Spent LiFePO4,Recycling,Environmental approaches,Energy storage and conversion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.057,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.057
Effect of excess lead on the structural and electrical characteristics of sol-gel synthesized RuO2/Pb(ZrxTi1−x)O3/RuO2,"In this study, we investigated the effect of excess lead on the structural and electrical characteristics of lead zirconate titanate [Pb(ZrxTi1−x)O3, PZT] thin films using the sol-gel spin coating method. X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and field-emission transmission electron microscopy were used to study the structural, morphological, chemical, and microstructural features, respectively, of these films as functions of the growth conditions (excess lead concentrations of 10, 20, and 25mol%). The PZT thin film prepared at the 20mol% condition exhibited the best electrical characteristics including a lower leakage current of 6×10−7 A/cm2 at an electric field of 50kV/cm, a larger capacitance value of 1.92μF/cm2 at a frequency of 1kHz, and a higher remanent polarization of 20.1μC/cm2 at a frequency of 5kHz. We attribute this behavior to the optimal amount of excess lead in this PZT film forming a perovskite structure and suppressing the reaction of PZT film with RuO2 electrode.","Bag, Sankar Prasad;Her, Jim-Long;Pan, Tung-Ming",2016-12-31,Ceramics International,"Excess lead,Lead zirconate titanate (PZT),Sol-gel,RuO2 electrode",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.08.173,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.08.173
Biomimetic chitosan-hydroxyapatite hybrid biocoatings for enamel remineralization,"Development of biomimetic ceramic-based materials is currently a challenge in dental tissue engineering. Synthetic hybrid chitosan (CS)-hydroxyapatite (HAP) layers are regarded as candidates for teeth remineralization, protection against further demineralization ensuring also antibacterial activity. Thus, the aim of this work was to obtain new biomimetic CS-HAP layers for restoration of damaged mature enamels and to pursue morphological, compositional, structural and hardness modifications of the grown layers by immersion for 4, 7 and 10 days into artificial saliva (AS) under CS-Emdogain (EMD) hydrogel action. SEM-EDX, HRTEM-SAED, FTIR and micro-Raman findings indicated formation of carbonate-substituted HAP, B-type, with c-axis orientation in the newly formed CS-HAP coatings. Prolonged immersion span of 10 days caused increasing CS content in the superficial grown layer while carbonate content diminished. Optimum Ca/P ratio (1.85at%) and hardness of 2.48GPa were recorded for seven days growth using CS-EMD hydrogel. Subtle changes in HAP lattice parameters were recorded for 10-day grown layer while c-axis orientation of HAP crystals at mesoscale was preserved. Mechanism of CS interaction during in situ biomimetic synthesis and self-assembly of HAP crystals under CS-EMD hydrogel presence is also discussed.","Zaharia, Agripina;Muşat, Viorica;Anghel, Elena Maria;Atkinson, Irina;Mocioiu, Oana-Cătălina;Buşilă, Mariana;Pleşcan, Viorica Ghisman",2017-10-01,Ceramics International,"B.

Studies on the spin coating process of silica films,"Silica xerogel films with good uniformity and various thicknesses were successfully prepared by a two-step acid-base catalyst procedure and spin coating. After the addition of ammonia catalyst, the sol changes gradually from a Newtonian fluid to a shear-thinning one due to the progress of polymerization reactions. An empirical equation using the relative ratio of reaction time to gel time can give successful prediction of sol viscosity. Our systematic study of the coating process indicates the existence of a process window in terms of t/t gel and spin speed can be defined for obtaining uniform and defect-free films. It is difficult to obtain films with good quality when the viscosity of the sol is either too high or too low. Another parameter that also exhibits strong influence on film thickness is the concentration of TEOS in the starting solution. Finally, the film thickness was found to correlate well with sol viscosity and spin speed as h=A η 0.45 ϖ −0.62.","Huang, Ya-Yu;Chou, Kan-Sen",2003-12-31,Ceramics International,"Silica film,Spin coating,Process window",10.1016/S0272-8842(02)00191-8,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0272-8842(02)00191-8
Synthesis and characterization of boehmitic alumina coated graphite by sol–gel method,"Non-wettability property makes graphite a good protecting material against the molten metal and/or slag. Properties like high oxidation potential between 600 and 1200°C and non-wettability with water at room temperatures limits the usage of graphite in castable refractory applications. In this study, sol–gel method, which is a relatively cheaper process, was used. Boehmitic sol was obtained by hydrolyzing and peptiziting the alkoxide AIP (aluminum isopropoxide) used as alumina source. Then natural flake graphite was mixed with the boehmitic solution for coating of graphite. At 120°C boehmitic sol coated graphite was dried and gelled. Then heat threaded at 550°C for γ-Al2O3 transformation of boehmite. Products that obtained from the studies were characterized with FTIR and XRD tests.

Low temperature synthesis of pure phase TaB2 powders and its oxidation protection modification behaviors for Si-based ceramic coating in dynamic oxidation environments,"To reveal the generation mechanisms of the Ta-Si-O glass ceramics layer in dynamic oxidation environments, a 40 wt% TaB2-SiC coating was prepared by liquid phase sintering method. To obtain pure phase TaB2 powders at lower temperature (1500 °C), excessive B2O3 powders were added in raw materials to eliminate the TaC byproduct phase. The hexagonal pure phase TaB2 powders own average particle size of about 386 nm. During the TGA dynamic oxidation tests, after the modification of 40 wt% TaB2, the initial weight loss temperature of the sample delayed by about 48%, while the weight loss percentage and rate in fastest weight loss zone decreased by about 61% and 53%, respectively. During oxidation, the generated Ta-oxides were peeled and carried away by the formed fluid SiO2 glass layer to form “Ta-oxides halation” at first, which results the dissolution of Ta-oxides in the SiO2 glass, thus forming the Ta-Si-O glass ceramics with dendritic structure. With the spread of the SiO2 glass layer and growth of the Ta-Si-O dendrite, the Ta-Si-O glass ceramics gradually cover on the surface of the SiO2 glass layer, forming the structure of Ta-Si-O/SiO2 double glass layer that is capable of sealing and arresting of microcracks.","Ren, Xuanru;Wang, Lifeng;Feng, Peizhong;Zhang, Ping;Guo, Litong;Sun, Xiaojun;Mo, Hongsheng;Li, Ziyu",2018-09-30,Ceramics International,"TaB2,Powders,Coating,Liquid phase sintering,Oxidation protection,Glass ceramics",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.212,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.212

Optimization of C/TiC x duplex diffusion barrier coatings for SiC f /Ti composites based on interfacial structure evolution exploration,"Introducing a carbon single coating is a popular method used to protect SiC f /Ti composites from severe interface reactions. However, carbon coatings lose their protective effect on SiC fibres at high temperature, even after a short period time. As such, given the strong demand for high temperature applications in aeronautics and astronautics a more coating which is more effective at high temperatures is desirable. In order to improve the high temperature interfacial stability of SiC f /Ti composites, a C/TiC x duplex coating system with different C contents in TiC x was introduced to explore the protection of fibres at 1200 °C for 1 h. The results show that the C/quasi-stoichiometric TiC coating system protects the SiC fibres most effectively. Based on insights from the evolution of the interface structure, TiC x has been identified as an interfacial reaction product from the C single coating, exhibiting a gradient in C content and grain size, which is different from a deposited TiC layer with a well-distributed composition and structure. The different coating structure gives rise to different ability to resist C diffusion at high temperatures, in which poor resistance ability appears in TiC x interfacial reaction layer coming from C single coating due to short-circuit diffusion in C-rich fine-grained TiC layer and fast intracrystalline diffusion trigged by amounts of vacancies in sub-stoichiometric coarse-grained TiC layer. Therefore, C/quasi-stoichiometric TiC duplex coatings with a thick, coarse-grained quasi-stoichiometric TiC layer could effectively inhibit C diffusion by comparison to C single coatings, and is more effective than C/rich-carbon TiC duplex coatings due to the existence of short-circuit diffusion in the latter. As such, C/quasi-stoichiometric TiC duplex coatings appear to be an optimal diffusion barrier for SiCf/Ti composites at high temperature.","Wang, Minjuan;Huang, Hao;Huang, Xu;Wen, Mao;Choy, Kwang Leong;Song, Cheng;Pan, Feng",2018-10-01,Ceramics International,"SiC f /Ti composites,C single coating,C/TiC x duplex coating,Quasi stoichiometric ratio of TiC,Carbon rich TiC",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.072,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.072
Sintering effects on mechanical properties of glass-reinforced hydroxyapatite composites,"The improvement of mechanical properties of hydroxyapatite (HA) with reinforcement of two (45.5 wt.% P2O5, 54.5 wt.% CaO) and three-oxide (45 wt.% P2O5, 28 wt.% CaO, 27 wt.% Na2O) glasses with different sintering temperatures is studied. Although HA shows great biocompatibility with the human body, its applications are limited to non load-bearing areas and coatings due to its low mechanical properties. These mechanical properties can be improved substantially with addition of glass ceramics by sintering. In this study, naturally produced HA from human teeth is sintered with varying addition of two and three-oxide glass ceramics. The microhardness measurements, the density and the compression tests are performed in order to find the optimum sintering temperature. Finally average hardness value of 285±19 HV, average density of 2.79±0.05 g cm−3 and compressive strength value of σ avr=67±17 MPa have been achieved by sintering at 1200 °C with the addition of 10 wt.% two oxide glass into the HA. Results are implying that 10 wt.% of glass addition for HA composites is the maximum limit for such composites. Observations are supporting the idea that sodium free glasses could be better conciliated with the HA structure at high temperatures.","Oktar, Faik Nüzhet;Göller, Gültekin",2002-12-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Protective coating based on manganese–copper oxide for solid oxide fuel cell interconnects: Plasma spray coating and performance evaluation,"A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack requires metallic interconnects to electrically connect unit cells, while preventing fuel from mixing with oxidant. During SOFC operations, chromia scales continue to grow on the interconnect surfaces, resulting in a considerable increase of interfacial resistance, and at the same time, gaseous Cr species released from the chromia scales degrades the cathode performance. To address these problems, in this study, protective Mn2CuO4 coatings are fabricated on metallic interconnects (Crofer 22 APU) via a plasma spray (PS) process. The PS technique involves direct spray deposition of molten Mn2CuO4 onto the interconnect substrate and leads to the formation of high-density Mn2CuO4 coatings without the need for post-heat-treatment. The thickness, morphology, and porosity of the PS-Mn2CuO4 coating are found to depend on the processing parameters, including plasma arc power, gas flow rate, and substrate temperature. The PS-Mn2CuO4 coating fabricated with optimized parameters is completely impermeable to gases and has high adhesion strength on the interconnect substrate. Furthermore, no resistive chromia scales are formed at the coating/substrate interface during the PS process. As a result, the PS-Mn2CuO4-coated interconnects show a very low area-specific resistance below 10 mΩ cm2 at 800 °C in air and excellent stability during both continuous operation and repeated thermal cycling. This work suggests that an appropriate combination of the material and coating process provides a highly effective protective layer for SOFC interconnects.","Waluyo, Nurhadi S.;Park, Seong-Sik;Song, Rak-Hyun;Lee, Seung-Bok;Lim, Tak-Hyoung;Hong, Jong-Eun;Ryu, Kwang Hyun;Bin Im, Won;Lee, Jong-Won",2018-07-31,Ceramics International,"Solid oxide fuel cell,Metallic interconnect,Protective coating,Spinel oxide,Plasma spray coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.220,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.220
A BiVO4 photoanode grown on porous and conductive SnO2 ceramics for water splitting driven by solar energy,"The transformation of solar energy into chemical energy stored as hydrogen fuel underlies the water splitting process into O2 and H2 in photo-electrochemical (PEC) cells. This a potentially promising technology to generate renewable and clean energy. To make this technology commercially viable, the engineering of appropriate low-cost and robust photo-electrode materials and substrates is needed. In this study, we introduce BiVO4-photoelectrodes grown on conductive bulk SnO2–Sb2O5 ceramics acting as porous substrate. For these photoelectrodes, the value of photocurrent density of 1.1 mA/cm2 was achieved in 0.1 M NaOH electrolyte at 1.23 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) under LED light (λ = 455 nm). This PEC performance of these BiVO4 photoelectrodes is reached in spite of using a simple and low-cost deposition technique, where the BiVO4-precursor is delivered to the bulk porous ceramic substrate as a nebulized aerosol in air-flow at room temperature. The high porosity of the ceramic substrate permits some permeation of the aerogel into the pores to a depth of several micrometers to provide a 3D-growth of the BiVO4-coating on conductive SnO2 grains. The film thickness of the BiVO4 on individual grains is approximately 100 nm. This construction of the photoelectrode leads to an effective interface with good absorption of solar radiation and good electron harvesting. The bulk ceramics assure favorable conditions for electron collection and charge transport, which results in a good PEC performance with this type of photoanode.","Bondarchuk, Alexander N.;Corrales-Mendoza, Iván;Aguilar-Martínez, Josué A.;Tomás, Sergio A.;Gómez-Caiceros, Daniel A.;Hernández-Méndez, Arturo;Marken, Frank",2020-05-31,Ceramics International,"Tin dioxide ceramics,Solar energy,Hydrogen energy,Bismuth vanadate,Water treatment,Water splitting",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.152,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.152
Effect of gallium ion content on thermal stability and reliability of YAG: Ce phosphor films for white LEDs,"Y2.94(Al1−xGax)5O12:0.06Ce (x = 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3) phosphors were prepared by conventional solid-state reaction. Phosphor films are prepared from the synthesized Y2.94(Al1−xGax)5O12:0.06Ce phosphors by a simple spin coating method. The influence of different content of Ga3+ doping on the photoluminescence (PL) spectra, thermal stability and reliability of prepared Y2.94(Al1−xGax)5O12:0.06Ce (x = 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3) phosphor films were investigated. The emission peak of the Y2.94(Al1−xGax)5O12:0.06Ce (x = 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3) phosphor films shifted from 545nm to 520nm with the Ga3+ content(i.e. the value of x) increasing from 0.05 to 0.3 excited at 460nm. The phosphor films have excellent thermal stability, and the intensities of PL spectra decrease by about 2%, 5%, 20% and 50% at 373K, 423K, 473K and 523K, respectively. The xenon lamp aging test show that the relative PL spectra intensity of the phosphor films decreases to 95.55%, 96.24%, 96.05%, 97.67%, 95.96% and 93.22% with the x value is 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25 and 0.3 after the xenon lamp aging test for 168h. The high temperature and high humidity test show that the relative PL spectra intensity of the phosphor films decreases to 94.36%, 95.6%, 95.26%, 96.87%, 95.28% and 93.1% with the x value is 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25 and 0.3 after the condition of 85℃/RH85% for 168h.

Microstructure and wear resistance behavior of Ti–C–B4C-reinforced composite coating,"Poor wear resistance and microhardness of nickel (Ni)-based alloy pose major concern and challenges in industrial applications. To enhance mechanical properties, composites reinforced with different contents of titanium (Ti), carbon (C), and boron carbide (B4C) particles were prepared on the 45# die steel by laser cladding. Microstructure characteristics and evolution mechanisms were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Hardness and wear testers were used to measure microhardness distribution and wear resistance of composite coating. Results indicated that in situ synthesized TiC, TiB2, carbides, and borides in the coating significantly refined microstructure, which were uniformly distributed. Diffusion of Ti and C in the matrix contributed to obvious dispersion strengthening, improved bonding strength among ceramic particles through ring phase and multiphase, and increased holding force of matrix, which are responsible for the good wear resistance. Coatings with 9:1:5 and 11.5:1:2.5 mass fraction ratios of Ti/C/B4C exhibited the highest microhardness and the lowest friction coefficient (low speed wear), which are 4.98–5.1 times higher and 4.75 times smaller than those of original Ni204 coating, respectively. All samples show a small value of friction coefficient (<0.3) under high frequency wear conditions, and the wear resistance is closely related to the bonding strength of matrix and ceramics.","Zhao, Yu;Yu, Tianbiao;Chen, Liaoyuan;Chen, Ying;Guan, Chuang;Sun, Jiayu",2020-11-30,Ceramics International,"Ti/C/B4C,Ni204 alloy,Laser cladding,Microstructure,Microhardness",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.300,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.300
Characterization and oxidation properties of biomorphic porous carbon with SiC gradient coating prepared by PIP method,"A biomorphic porous carbon coated with SiC (SiC/BPC) was prepared by controlled carbonizing native pine under Ar atmosphere and then processed with precursor infiltration-pyrolysis (PIP) of organosilane. Microstructure and component of SiC/BPC were analyzed by FT-IR, XRD, SEM and EDS (attached with line scanning program). The non-isothermal oxidation properties and mechanism of SiC/BPC were studied by TGA. The kinetic parameters were calculated through model-free kinetics methods. Experimental results showed that SiC/BPC had a topologically uniform interconnected porous network microstructure; the obtained gradient SiC coating on BPC surface was amorphous and combined well with the carbon surface, which can improve the oxidation resistance of BPC clearly. The non-isothermal oxidation reaction of SiC/BPC exhibited a partial self-accelerating characteristic. The oxidation process was complicated, firstly it was controlled by gas diffusion in coating, then controlled by chemical reaction, and at last it was controlled by gas diffusion and chemical reaction together, the corresponding effective activation energy was calculated also.","Gong, Weiwei;Gao, Pengzhao;Wang, Wenxiang",2011-08-31,Ceramics International,"Biomorphic porous carbon,SiC gradient coating,Model-free kinetic",10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.03.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.03.008
Thermochromic characteristics of WO3-doped vanadium dioxide thin films prepared by sol–gel method,"Thin films of tungsten-doped vanadium oxide were fabricated on an alumina substrate by spin coating technology.

Non-doped VO2 film exhibited the best switching property of 4.0 orders of magnitude of electrical resistance and a small hysteresis of approximately 5°C width. Tungsten in VO2 led to a diffuse phase transition and weak jump of electrical resistivity. A reduction of the transition temperature by 15.5°C/mol was observed for the tungsten doping in this study.","Cho, Jeong-Ho;Byun, Young-Jun;Kim, Jin-Ho;Lee, Young-Jin;Jeong, Young-Hun;Chun, Myoung-Pyo;Paik, Jong-Hoo;Sung, Tae Hyun",2012-01-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Use of nonconventional raw materials in ceramic production,"This paper reports possibilities for use of nonconventional natural and synthetic raw materials in ceramic bodies and glazes. Reactivity during the process of heating can be considered as a modern criterion for ceramic raw materials. A review of several types of alkali-containing rocks is made, which are more fusible than the common fluxes. The greater fluxing power of these raw materials compared to the traditional types provides for a higher rate of body sintering. As a result of this intensified process, a higher structural density and better mechanical strength of the bodies are achieved with shortened firing cycles. The introduction of more active fluxes reduces firing costs and allows economy of high quality traditional fluxing raw materials in the production of some tablewares, sanitary wares and faience tiles. In combination with more reactive silicon-containing raw materials, the influence of the fluxes on sintering increases. This combined beneficial effect is experimentally confirmed in glaze frit melting and in the firing of glaze coatings. Investigations on these processes are discussed. As a nonconventional raw material in the modern ceramic production, wollastonite can be considered. Since natural deposits of this valuable material are rarely found the use of synthetic wollastine is discussed. Obtaining an anorthite reaction phase in the ceramic bodies provides the formation of a compact and stable structure that permits firing in short and single cycle.","Andreeva, V.;Fekeldjiev, G.",1986-12-31,Ceramics International, ,10.1016/0272-8842(86)90049-0,https://doi.org/10.1016/0272-8842(86)90049-0
Alumina coating deposition by electron-beam evaporation of ceramic using a forevacuum plasma-cathode electron source,"We have explored the formation of alumina coatings by electron beam evaporation of bulk alumina ceramic using a forevacuum-pressure plasma-cathode electron beam source at a pressure of 60 mTorr of air. The alumina e-beam target material is evaporated at a rate up to 4.2 g/h, and the coating deposition rate is up to 18 μm/h. The evaporated ceramic is partially ionized by the energetic electron beam, and we have measured the plasma composition as a function of beam power.

Synthesis and characterization of corrosion-resistant and biocompatible Al2O3–TiB2 nanocomposite films on pure titanium,"Alumina is widely used as a coating on a metal implant due to its favorable mechanical and biological properties. In this research, in order to improve mechanical and biological properties of alumina, a composition of nanoparticles of alumina (instead of microparticles) and titanium diboride micro powder is introduced. The atmospheric plasma spray (APS) technique was applied to deposit Al2O3–TiB2 on the pure titanium substrate. The properties of Al2O3–TiB2 nanocomposite coatings with various weight percent of TiB2 (20, 30 and 40 wt%) were experimentally studied. The characteristics of nanocomposite films of TiB2 (20, 30 and 40 wt%) were analyzed using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive electron spectroscopy (EDX) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) tests. The XRD spectra exhibited that in addition to alumina and titanium diboride, the films contained titania. Thickness and morphology of the films were calculated from FE-SEM images and the thickness of the optimized coating (Al2O3-30 wt% TiB2) was about 30–45 μm. Also, the roughness, corrosion resistance, hardness and cytotoxicity (MTT) tests were studied. The highest of hardness and roughness of the samples were obtained from Al2O3-30 wt% TiB2. According to the obtained results from the polarization test, Al2O3-30 wt% TiB2 coating had the highest corrosion resistance (222558.9962 Ω cm2). Therefore, the toxicity of Al2O3-30 wt% TiB2 was investigated as the optimized coating and the results confirmed its non-toxicity and biocompatibility.","Sajedi Alvar, Fatemeh;Heydari, Mojgan;Kazemzadeh, Asghar;Vaezi, Mohammad Reza;Nikzad, Leila",2020-03-31,Ceramics International,"Nanocomposite,Al2O3–TiB2,Corrosion-resistant,Biocompatible,Titanium",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.140,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.140
Fabrication and characterization of highly hydrophobic rutile TiO2-based coatings for self-cleaning,"Highly hydrophobic rutile TiO2 nanocomposites modified by silica (SiO2) and silane coupling agent KH570 were synthesized. The chemical structure and morphology of TiO2 nanopowders before and after modification were investigated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscope techniques. The results revealed that a continuous and dense SiO2 coating layers was formed on TiO2 surfaces via Si–O–Ti bonds first, acting as a barrier that separates TiO2 particles from the medium. Then after modification by KH570, the composite powder had obvious hydrophobic property. The amount of silane coupling agent had an important influence on the achieved properties. TiO2@SiO2 nanocomposites modified with 0.3 ml KH570 exhibited the best excellent hydrophobicity with water contact angle of 141°, highlighting its potential application as a pigment in exterior wall coatings.","Chen, Pengqi;Wei, Bangzheng;Zhu, Xi;Gao, Dalu;Gao, Yufei;Cheng, Jigui;Liu, Ye",2019-04-01,Ceramics International,"TiO2@SiO2,Modification,Hydrophobicity,Dispersion,Self-cleaning coatings",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.085,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.085
Thermal annealing characteristics of solar selective absorber coatings based on nano-multilayered MoOx films,"Designing double metal-dielectric (cermet) solar selective absorber coatings (SSACs) often requires complex co-sputtering techniques with multiple targets. This inevitably limits the simple and low-cost industrial fabrication. Here, we develop novel nano-multilayered MoOx-based SSACs by simple and stable one-step reactive magnetron sputtering process using single molybdenum target. The proposed multilayer SSACs exhibit good solar absorptance of 0.93 and low thermal emittance of 0.06. Owing to the temperature-induced oxygen diffusion and oxidation phenomenon the as-sputtered SSACs have a poor thermal tolerance under air atmosphere, and after annealing at 200 °C for 150 h, the resulting absorptance is diminished from 0.93 to 0.90. However, the optical performance of the annealed SSAC is relatively stable in high-vacuum environment, even after annealing at 450 °C for 200 h, it still displays an ideal spectral selectivity of 0.92/0.07. With above properties, the resulting MoOx-based SSAC is a promising absorber for enduring thermal harvesting in solar vacuum collectors.","Wang, Wei;Huan, Xi;Wang, Chengbing",2020-12-01,Ceramics International,"Nano-multilayer MoOx,Anti-reflection layer,Magnetron sputtering,Annealing",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.205,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.205
Enhanced thermal properties of silica-based ceramic cores prepared by coating alumina/mullite on the surface of fused silica powders,"In this study, an alumina/mullite coating was synthesized on the surface of fused silica powders to form an alumina/mullite-silica core-shell structure. The effects of the alumina/mullite coating on the cristobalite crystallization, thermal properties, and leachability of the silica-based ceramic cores were investigated using the simulated casting process. The X-ray diffraction results indicated that the crystallization of cristobalite was significant at the simulated casting temperature of approximately 1400 °C. An increase in the cristobalite content during this stage resulted in a large thermal expansion because of its higher coefficient of thermal expansion compared with that for fused silica. The addition of optimum amounts of the alumina/mullite powders resulted in an increase in the initial shrinkage temperature and a decrease in the shrinkage of the specimens. When the coating powders were added at 43 wt%, the initial shrinkage temperature increased from 1092 °C to 1200 °C and the shrinkage decreased sharply. Leaching tests showed that the silica-based ceramic cores were removed in the form of stripped layers. The washing and shaking process accelerated the disintegration of the ceramic core and improved its leachability.","Chen, Xiao;Zheng, Wenlong;Zhang, Jing;Liu, Chunyang;Han, Jiqing;Zhang, Li;Liu, Chunming",2020-06-01,Ceramics International,"Alumina/mullite coating,Silica-based ceramic core,Thermal property,Leachability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.216,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.216
Laser-induced oxidation assisted micro milling of spark plasma sintered TiB2-SiC ceramic,"In this work, a novel process of laser-induced oxidation assisted micro milling (LOMM) was proposed. TiB2-SiC ceramic with hardness of 24.6 ± 0.8 GPa was prepared by spark plasma sintering and used as the workpiece material. The cutting force, surface quality and tool wear mechanisms were investigated. Under laser irradiation and oxygen assistance, a porous oxide layer and relatively dense sub-layer were formed. The hardness of the sub-layer was found to be 12.8 ± 0.7 GPa which was far lower than that of the substrate. Both the cutting and thrust forces increased with increasing the feed per tooth and depth of cut in micro milling of the sub-layer material. The material removal mechanism was dominated by a transition from ductile to brittle mode as the feed per tooth increased from 0.3 μm/z to 1.2 μm/z. The surface roughness Ra of 46 nm was achieved when the cutting speed, feed per tooth and depth of cut were 31.4 m/min, 0.3 μm/z and 2 μm, respectively. The tool wear mechanism was characterized by the flank wear and coating spalling. As a case study, a micro slot having width of 0.5 mm and aspect ratio of 2 was fabricated by the LOMM. For comparison, the conventional micro milling was also carried out using the same cutting parameters. The surface quality fabricated by LOMM was better than that by the conventional micro milling. The machining efficiency in LOMM was improved by 104% as compared to the conventional micro milling.","Yang, Yinfei;Zhao, Guolong;Hu, Maoshun;Li, Liang;He, Ning",2019-07-31,Ceramics International,"Milling,Microstructure-final,Thermal properties,Borides",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.197,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.197
Wear behavior of plasma sprayed hydroxyapatite bioceramic coating in simulated body fluid,"To investigate the wear behavior of bioceramic coating, two-body abrasive wear of air-plasma sprayed (APS) hydroxyapatite (HA) coating was studied in different conditions including: i) in simulated body fluid (SBF) and in dry conditions, and ii) sliding on Al2O3 abrasive paper, HA, polycarbonate (PC) and polyurethane (PU), as well as iii) on different applied loads. Cross-sectional microstructures and worn surface morphologies of the coating were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Phase constitutions were analyzed by X-Ray diffraction (XRD). Microhardness, elastic modulus, fracture toughness and bond strength of the coating were investigated. It was revealed that, under the load of 20 N and sling on different counterpart materials, the wear rates of the coating varied from 24.09 × 10−2to 0.25 × 10−2 mg/Nm in SBF and varied from 13.54 × 10−2 to 0.05 × 10−2 mg/Nm in dry condition, respectively. The accumulated weight loss of the coating sliding on HA in SBF increased from 3.1 to 7.9 mg as the applied load increased from 5 N to 20 N. As sliding on Al2O3 in dry condition and/or under high load, the abrasive wear of the coating dominantly occurred in the form of ploughing and peeling off of splats. As sliding on PC, PU and HA in SBF, the adhesive wear of the coating mainly occurred in the form of exfoliation.","Chen, Qing-Yu;Zou, Yan-Long;Fu, Wei;Bai, Xiao-Bo;Ji, Gang-Chang;Yao, Hai-Long;Wang, Hong-Tao;Wang, Fang",2019-03-31,Ceramics International,"Wear behavior,Plasma sprayed hydroxyapatite bioceramic coating,SBF lubrication,Different counterpart materials,Two body abrasive wear",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.137,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.137
Effect of substrate temperature on the mechanical and tribological properties of W/WC produced by DC magnetron sputtering,"W/WC bilayers were grown using the DC magnetron sputtering technique and varying substrate temperature. The mechanical and tribological behaviors were characterized using the nanoindentation and pin-on-disk techniques. The hardness and Young's modulus tended to increase, while the coefficient of friction tended to be stable with increasing substrate temperature. Moreover, better mechanical and tribological performances were observed for all of the coated systems compared with the uncoated steel. Furthermore, the inclusion of a W interlayer did not significantly influence the hardness; nevertheless, this interlayer dramatically improved the coating tribological behavior, thus producing less coating damage and decreasing the wear rate.","Agudelo-Morimitsu, L.C.;De La Roche, J.;Ruden, A.;Escobar, D.;Restrepo-Parra, E.",2014-06-30,Ceramics International,"C.

Si/SiC coated Cf/SiC composites via tape casting and reaction bonding: The effect of carbon content,"In this paper, a novel surface modification method for Cf/SiC composites is proposed. Si/SiC coating on Cf/SiC composites is prepared by tape casting and reaction bonding method. The effects of carbon content on the rheological property of the slurries along with the microstructure of the sintered coatings are investigated. The best result has been obtained by infiltrating liquid silicon into a porous green tape with a carbon density of 0.84g/cm3. In addition, the effect of sintering parameters on the phase composition of the coatings is studied. Dense Si/SiC coating with high density as well as strong bonding onto the substrate is obtained. This Si/SiC coating exhibits an excellent mechanical property with HV hardness of 16.29±0.53GPa and fracture toughness of 3.01±0.32MPam1/2. Fine surface with roughness (RMS) as low as 2.164nm is achieved after precision grinding and polishing.

Microstructures and mechanical properties of brazed Al2O3/Cu joints with bismuth glass,"Alumina ceramics and copper were vacuum brazed using a bismuth-borate-zinc glass at temperatures between 660 and 720 °C for 20 min. The interfacial phases were characterized and the influence of brazing temperatures on microstructure of the joints were investigated. Shear tests of brazed joints under different conditions were also performed, and the joint fracture was observed and analyzed to determine the influence of brazing temperatures on the joint mechanical properties. Al2O3 ceramic/Al2O3 + glass phase/ZnAl2O4 + glass phase/(Ni, Cu)O/Ni(s.s) + BiNi/copper was identified as the main structure of the Al2O3 joints brazed with the glass. As the brazing temperature increased, the (Ni, Cu)O oxide layer in the joint was observed to thicken and extend to both sides gradually. The amount of BiNi formed in the Ni coating layer increased, and the scattered ZnAl2O4 particles gradually grew. When the brazing temperature reached 700 °C, ZnAl2O4 particles agglomerated on the alumina ceramic side, and glass permeated into the alumina base material. The shear strength of the joint first increased and then decreased with the increase of brazing temperature. The shear strength reached the maximum value of 21.1 MPa when brazed at 680 °C.","Chen, Haiyan;Ren, Xiaowei;Guo, Wei;Wan, Meiling;Shen, Zhikang;Liu, Xiaochao;Feng, Mingyang",2019-09-30,Ceramics International,"Al2O3 ceramic,Bismuth glass,ZnAl2O4 particle,Permeation layer",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.123,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.123
"Mo-doped indium oxide films by dip-coating: Synthesis, microstructure and optical properties","Molybdenum doped indium oxide (In2−x Mo x O3, IMO) is widely used in many electronic and optoelectronic devices due to its excellent electrical properties and optical transparency. In this work, a first attempt to produce IMO films by sol–gel dip coating was reported, starting from different reagents (i.e. indium nitrate or indium chloride and molybdenum chloride or ammonium molybdate as In and Mo sources, respectively). The influence of different reagents, solvents and annealing atmospheres (i.e. air and N2) on final coating properties was investigated in order to properly select the optimal process parameters. The morphological, microstructural and optical properties of the produced coatings were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and UV–vis spectroscopy. The best performances, in terms of microstructure and transparency, were obtained for films produced by dip coating the indium nitrate and molybdenum chloride based solutions (In nitrate concentration 0.1–0.2M), with the addition of a low amount of PEG, followed by annealing at 500°C. The produced coatings consisted of monophasic In2O3 and were characterised by a uniform, homogeneous and cracks free surface, and high transmittance values in the vis range (i.e. 85–98%).","Nanni, Francesca;Lamastra, Francesca Romana;Franceschetti, Fabio;Biccari, Francesco;Cacciotti, Ilaria",2014-01-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Impermeability of boron nitride defect-sensitive monolayer with atomic-oxygen-healing ability,"Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a new type of anti-corrosion coating. However, a large number of studies have shown that defects can significantly reduce the barrier property of h-BN. So how to repair the defect of h-BN is a problem to be solved. In this study, we used the density functional theory of the first principle to calculate the barrier properties of perfect h-BN and the h-BN with various vacancies. The study showed that monolayer h-BN has impermeability to all gas molecules, and vacancies can greatly reduce the barrier ability of h-BN to oxygen molecules. Fortunately, atomic oxygen can block the vacancy site of h-BN by chemical adsorption, thereby reducing the impact of vacancies on h-BN. Compared to the situation before the vacancy repaired, the barrier ability of h-BN to oxygen molecules was greatly increased after being repaired. In addition, the electron cloud density at vacancies after the repair (with) atomic oxygen was also greatly increased. Therefore, atomic oxygen can repair vacancies of h-BN and enhance the barrier ability of the defective h-BN. The research in this paper is of some significance. It is helpful to repair h-BN and evaluate corrosion resistance of h-BN in oxygen-rich or atomic-oxygen-rich environment.","Liu, Kun;Zhang, Guangan;Pu, Jibin;Ma, Fei;Wu, Guizhi;Lu, Zhibin",2018-08-15,Ceramics International,"h-BN,Impermeability,Atomic-oxygen,Self-healing",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.236,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.236

The grain size is about 70nm and the grains present equiaxed and columnar crystal morphologies. Moreover, 5nm-sized nanocrystals are embedded in an amorphous phase. The (TiCr)CN composite coating possesses high hardness (1325 ± 120 HV) and toughness (4.35 ± 0.53MPam1/2). The friction coefficient and wear rate of the coating are 0.46 and 3.01 ± 0.17 × 10−6 mm3 N−1 m−1, respectively.

The thermal shock response of both as-sprayed TBCs was investigated at 1000°C. Experimental results indicated that the nanostructured 5.5SYSZ TBCs have better thermal shock performance in contrast to 4SYSZ TBCs due to their higher tetragonal phase content and higher fracture toughness of this coating,"Loghman-Estarki, M.R.;Shoja Razavi, R.;Jamali, H.;Ashiri, R.",2016-07-31,Ceramics International,"Thermal shock resistance,Atmospheric plasma spraying,Nanostructured thermal barrier coatings",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.018

Developing porous diopside/hydroxyapatite bio-composite scaffolds via a combination of freeze-drying and coating process,"The development of diopside/hydroxyapatite (DP/HA) bio-composite scaffolds, that possess an interconnected pore architecture via the combination of freeze-drying and coating process was studied. For coating the freeze-drying HA scaffolds by diopside, various impregnation times (1, 3, and 5 days) were applied, and followed by a sintering process at 950 °C. The alterations in microstructure, physico-mechanical behaviour and phase composition of the produced composites were investigated. In vitro bioactivity and degradation studies of the selected composite were also carried out. The results demonstrated that the diffusion of diopside within the hydroxyapatite scaffolds during the coating process improved the compressive strength of the composite material. HA scaffolds coated with diopside for 3 days were chosen for the remaining study due to their combination of adequate interconnected porosity (60.54 ± 1.02%) and suitable compressive strength (1.23 ± 0.04 MPa). The good bioactivity of DP/HA scaffolds was detected through the genesis of an apatite layer over the surface and their acceptable degradation rate in comparison to that of the blank HA scaffold.","Sayed, M.;Mahmoud, E.M.;Bondioli, F.;Naga, S.M.",2019-05-31,Ceramics International,"Diopside,Freeze-drying,Apatite,Mechanical behaviour,Degradation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.236,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.236
Improved corrosion resistance of AZ91D magnesium alloy coated by novel cold-sprayed Zn-HA/Zn double-layer coatings,"In order to improve the corrosion resistance and bioactivity of biodegradable Mg alloy substrate, novel Zn-HA/Zn double-layer coatings with different HA/Zn ratios in weight were deposited on AZ91D substrates by cold spraying. Phase compositions and microstructures of as-sprayed coatings and coatings after corrosion tests were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Electrochemical corrosion behaviors of both Zn-HA/Zn double-layer coatings were investigated in Hanks’ simulated body fluid using potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Results showed that both the pure Zn coating and HA/Zn composite coatings presented the similar phase compositions with their primary powders in addition to Zn oxidizations. Zn powders were plastically deformed and partially oxidized due to its low melting point, while HA powders were mainly crashed into fragments and hill-like splats. Both Zn under layer and HA/Zn upper layer were well bonded and presented dense structures, differences in HA/Zn upper layers were related to the HA/Zn ratios. Potentiodynamic polarization and EIS measurements illustrated that the cold-sprayed Zn-HA/Zn double-layer coatings not only improve the corrosion resistance of Mg alloy substrates, but also enhance its bioactivity due to the HA existed in composite upper layer.","Yao, Hai-Long;Yi, Zhi-Hai;Yao, Chao;Zhang, Meng-Xian;Wang, Hong-Tao;Li, Shi-Bin;Bai, Xiao-Bo;Chen, Qing-Yu;Ji, Gang-Chang",2020-04-15,Ceramics International,"HA/Zn,Cold spraying,Double-layer coating,Corrosion resistance,Microstructure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.271,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.271

Ti/TiN/HA coating on Ti–6Al–4V for biomedical applications,"An unbalanced physical vapor deposition (PVD) magnetron sputtering technique was used to deposit a titanium/titanium nitride/hydroxyapatite (Ti/TiN/HA) multilayer coating on Ti–6Al–4V. The Taguchi optimization method with an orthogonal array of L9 was utilized to determine the optimal conditions of coating for better surface integrity. The effects of the temperature, DC bias voltage, nitrogen flow rate, and DC power on the adhesion strength, coefficient of friction, surface hardness, and surface roughness were investigated. In achieving the optimized coating parameters, the signal to noise (S/N) response analysis method was implemented. Confirmation tests were carried out to demonstrate the improvement using the best combination of parameters obtained from the optimization process. The surface hardness of the Ti/TiN coated and uncoated specimens was enhanced by 14% and 48%, respectively. The adhesion strength of the coating to the substrate, coefficient of friction, and surface roughness were improved by 5.1%, 43%, and 10.52%, respectively. Finally, hydroxyapatite was successfully deposited atop Ti/TiN coated Ti–6Al–4V using a PVD sputtering technique to improve the biocompatibility of the substrate. The presence of Ti/TiN interfacial thin layers between the HA layer and substrate enhanced the adhesion strength of the HA coating on the substrate by 44.57% compared to the HA-coated substrate without the interfacial layers.","Mohseni, E.;Zalnezhad, E.;Bushroa, A.R.;Abdel Magid Hamouda,;Goh, B.T.;Yoon, G.H.",2015-12-31,Ceramics International,"Ti–6Al–4V,PVD magnetron sputtering,Ti/TiN coating,Hydroxyapatite,Mechanical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.07.081,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.07.081
Comparison of thermal insulation capability between conventional and nanostructured plasma sprayed YSZ coating on Ni3Al substrates,"Conventional and nanostructured yttria-stabilized zirconia(YSZ) as thermal barrier coatings were directly deposited on Ni3Al intermetallic compound substrates without bond coating by atmospheric plasma spraying. The adherence, thermal insulation capability, microstructure, porosity and sintering resistance of these two kinds of coatings were studied. For the thickness of 150µm YSZ coating without bond coating, the temperature drop ( ∆ T=98℃) of the nanostructured YSZ coating at 1200℃ increases by 50.8% compared with that of the conventional YSZ coating ( ∆ T=65℃). It is shown that the nanostructured YSZ coating has higher thermal insulation capability than the conventional YSZ coating, which is mainly due to its special microstructure with more semi-molten particles (21.78±0.54%), higher porosity (8.81±0.35%) and better sintering resistance.","Chen, Dan;Luo, Fa;Lou, Xufei;Qing, Yuchang;Zhou, Wancheng;Zhu, Dongmei",2017-04-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,Yttria-stabilized zirconia,Ni3Al substrates,Thermal insulation capability,Plasma spraying",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.076,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.076
Segregation of S at Mo(001)/MoSi2(001) interface,"The interface stability and electronic properties of Mo(001)/MoSi2(001) interface have been studied by the first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. According to the work of separation and charge density, these influences of sulfur on the interface adhesion of Mo/MoSi2 were revealed, and the preventing effect of Hf on the interface segregation of S was investigated. The results show that the interface structure of Mo(001)/MoSi2(001) prefers to the hollow coordination, and the separation planes of three different terminated structures with hollow coordinations are all Si–Si layers on the MoSi2 block of the interface. The calculations also suggest that S can segregate at Mo(001)/MoSi2(001) interface, and the interface segregation of S would further cause the electrons deficiency of adjacent Si–Si layer on the MoSi2 block, which is unfavorable to the interface adhesion. Alloying Mo with Hf can pin effectively S in bulk Mo system to prevent the interface segregation of S.

Numerical analysis of the influence of pore microstructure on thermal conductivity and Young's modulus of thermal barrier coating,"In this paper, the thermal conductivity and Young's modulus of the thermal barrier coating (TBC) system with various pore morphologies are numerically investigated. A multi-parameter random grown method, based on the quartet structure generation set algorithm, is adopted to generate the TBC model with simulation realistic pore microstructure. The morphological parameters of the pores include total porosity, pore size, pore aspect ratio and pore angle. The thermal conductivity and Young's modulus of coatings with different pore morphologies are discussed by the finite element method. The results show that the total porosity, pore aspect ratio, and pore angle have significant effects on the thermal conductivity and Young's modulus of TBC. Coating with pores arranged in the direction of 0° has the lowest thermal conductivity and the largest Young's modulus. With the change of pore angle, the thermodynamic properties show a different positive or negative correlation with the range of the pore aspect ratio. Besides, coating with small pore size has superior thermal insulation performance and thermal mismatch mechanical properties. The structural construction method and analysis method can also be applied to the field of materials with porous structure.","Sun, Fan;Fan, Xueling;Zhang, Tao;Jiang, Peng;Yang, Jingjing",2020-10-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,Random growth method,Thermal conductivity,Young's modulus",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.214,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.214
Influence of concentration of hydroxyapatite surface modifier agent on bioactive composite characteristics,"The characterization of chitosan – hydroxyapatite (CH – HAp) composite sponges prepared via freeze-drying methodology is reported in this study. Stearic acid (SA), added as a surface modifier of the HAp nanoparticles, induced changes in the TG/DTG results, particle size distribution and particle morphology. Composite sponges prepared with SA coated HAp demonstrated enhanced biocompatibility and structural properties, as compared to the composites prepared with uncoated HAp. SA coating modified the morphology of the composite, promoting a better dispersion of HAp particles within the composite sponges, and better homogeneity of the polymeric cover with HAp particles.

The thin films were prepared by a sol–gel spin-coating technique. It was observed that Ni0.8Zn0.2Fe2O4 thin films annealed at above 600°C exhibited a single phase cubic spinel structure, and the lattice constant of ferrite thin films decreased monotonically from 0.8370 to 0.8346nm.

Microstructure characterization revealed that the gradual densification of Yb2Si2O7 outer coating exposed to 1773 K reduced the oxygen diffusion pathes within the Yb2Si2O7/SiC bilayer coating, therefore, the weight loss rate of specimens decreased as oxidation proceeded. The oxidation activation energy of bilayer coating coated C/SiC specimen was 107.73 kJ/mol during long time oxidation within the temperature range from 1573 K to 1773 K. Based on the microstructure analysis and oxidation behavior of the specimens with different exposure time of oxidation, the oxygen diffusion rate in the bilayer coating was the controlling link during the long time oxidation course.","Chen, Pengju;Pan, Ling;Xiao, Peng;Li, Zhuan;Pu, Dongmei;Li, Jinwei;Pang, Liang;Li, Yang",2019-12-15,Ceramics International,"Yb2Si2O7 coating,SiC,Sol-gel,Air spraying,Oxidation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.132,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.132
Micro-arc oxidation of bioceramic coatings containing eggshell-derived hydroxyapatite on titanium substrate,"In the present study eggshells-derived hydroxyapatite (EHA) coatings were successfully produced on Ti6Al4V substrates using micro-arc oxidation process (MAO) at various concentrations of EHA (i.e. 1, 1.5 and 2 g/L) in an electrolyte consisting of tri-sodium orthophosphate. The attributes of the coatings were determine by X-ray diffraction, attenuated total reflectance-fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The adhesion strength was evaluated using micro scratch tester, while the corrosion behavior of the MAO-coated substrates in phosphate buffer solution was determined by an electrochemical method. The results showed that as the EHA concentration increased, this was accompanied by a reduction in the porosity due to the formation of a dense and thick coating layer. This has also resulted in an increased in the surface roughness and degree of crsytallinity of the HA phase. The MAO-coated substrate prepared with 1.5 g/L EHA concentration exhibited a well-formed coating layer with improved adhesive strength and excellent corrosion resistance. The mechanism of EHA-coating formation as well as the enhanced corrosion resistance of the coated substrates were discussed.

A systematic study on the growth of molybdenum disulfide with the carbon disulfide as the sulfurizing source,"In this work, the growth of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) was systematically investigated. Firstly, the stepwise investigation of dual source precursor approach was determined by energy dispersive X-ray, non-resonant Raman spectroscopy and Fourier transform Infrared. The spin-coated MoS-based films were transformed into MoS2 thin films via thermal vapour sulfurization with carbon disulfide as the sulfurizing source. The extension of sulfurization duration provides the better homogeneity and compactness of MoS2 thin films. However, the deformation of MoS2 nanostructure was observed beyond 40 min of sulfurization duration. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy detects the present of Mo4+ 3d and S2− 2p chemical states, which proves the highly formation of 2H-MoS2. Next, absorption features of MoS2 were discovered at ∼668 nm, ∼617 nm, and ∼447 nm. Resonant Raman (RR) spectroscopy shows multilayers of MoS2 are grown. However, multilayers wall of MoS2 nanoparticles was observed by the high-resolution transmission electron spectroscopy (HRTEM). The deviation of these observations (RR and HRTEM) is due to the rotational stacking fault of MoS2 layers.","Tan, A.L.;Ng, S.S.;Abu Hassan, H.",2019-08-01,Ceramics International,"Molybdenum disulfide,Dual source precursor,Spin coating,Carbon disulfide,Resonant Raman analysis",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.065,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.065
Hydration mechanism and sintering characteristics of hydratable alumina with microsilica addition,"Hydratable alumina is potential for the application in refractory industry as one of Ca-free binders, but it is greatly limited because of the excess hydration of rho-alumina (ρ-Al2O3). In this study, hydration mechanism and sintering characteristics of hydratable alumina with different microsilica addition are researched, via the rheological, hydration, and morphological characteristics of ρ-Al2O3–SiO2–H2O system during aging are analyzed using various techniques. Boehmite (AlOOH) initially appears and increases in content after 1 h aging at the setting temperature of 30 °C and relative humidity of 80%. As the addition of microsilica increases from 0 wt% to 8 wt%, the SiO2 coating combines with the boehmite gel and efficiently suppresses the hydration reaction, resulting in decrease of relative hydrated densities from 5.42% to 4.27% and increase of zeta potential from −10.1 mV to −21.3 mV. Further, the thus-formed SiO2-AlOOH gels cover the surface of hydratable alumina particles, connect with each other, and get distributed homogeneously around hydratable alumina particles to harden, thus inhibiting the further hydration. This is reflected by the high-temperature X-ray diffraction and the final sintering microstructures. Overall, these results indicate that the 6 wt% addition of microsilica makes hydratable alumina promising for application as a kind of controlled binders.","Xu, Nana;Li, Yuanbing;Li, Shujing;Wang, Hailu;Xiang, Ruofei;Ouyang, Si",2019-08-01,Ceramics International,"Hydratable alumina,Microsilica,Hydration control,Phase evolutions,Microstructures",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.074,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.074
Effect of sintering temperature on the microstructure and mechanical properties of ZrO2-3mol%Y2O3 sol–gel films,"The microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of ZrO2-3mol%Y2O3 films were investigated as a function of the sintering temperature in the range from 100°C to 1500°C, using a battery of characterization techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and nanoindentation. It was found that the crystallization occurs at temperatures close to 300°C. A gradual increase in the grain and crystallite sizes is observed as the sintering temperature increases up to 1000°C, and above this sintering temperature the tendency changes abruptly with a rapid increase in these values. Although Young's modulus of the coatings did not change with sintering temperature, a slight decrease was observed in the hardness values above 1000°C which is attributed to microstructure coarsening. Finally, a slight degradation of the films occurs above 1300°C, which is due to the occurrence of a process of grain spheroidization.","Díaz-Parralejo, A.;Ortiz, A.L.;Caruso, R.",2010-12-31,Ceramics International,"Mechanical properties,ZrO2,Ceramic films,Microstructure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2010.07.033,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2010.07.033
Fabrication of silver- and strontium-doped hydroxyapatite/TiO2 nanotube bilayer coatings for enhancing bactericidal effect and osteoinductivity,"Hydroxyapatite (HA)-coated implants are more susceptible to bacterial infection because their bioactive surface, which is favourable for osseointegration, could also become a reservoir for bacterial colonisation. To solve this problem, an electrodeposition method for preparing silver- and strontium-modified antibacterial HA layers onto TiO2 nanotubes (TNs) was developed. Ag was incorporated into the HA coating to improve its antimicrobial properties. Sr was added as a second binary element to offset the potential cytotoxicity of Ag. Results showed that Sr2+ and Ag+ could be evenly incorporated into the HA lattice to form SrAgHA coatings. The TN layer with a diameter of 100nm strengthens the adhesion via the anchoring effect. In vitro electrochemical corrosion studies demonstrated that the SrAgHA/TN coating sustains the stimulated body-fluid (SBF), thus indicating excellent corrosion resistance with a lower corrosion penetration rate than the bare commercially pure (CP)-Ti substrate. The composite coatings were found to be bioactive, based on the promotion of additional apatite onto the SrAgHA coating surface from SBF. Staphylococcus aureus growth was inhibited by SrAgHA/TN coatings, whereas the coatings without Ag had no effect on bacterial growth. MC3T3-E1 cell culture revealed that SrAgHA/TN demonstrated better cytocompatibility, and permitted stimulated cell proliferation, attachment and differentiation capacities than uncoated CP-Ti substrate. The addition of Sr to the AgHA coatings effectively counteracted the potentially negative effects and improved the performance compared with CP-Ti. The improved antibacterial effects, correlated with superior cytocompatibility and mechanical behaviour, suggested that SrAgHA/TN can be an alternative to pure HA for the preparation of reliable implant coatings for orthopaedic applications.","Huang, Yong;Zhang, Xuejiao;Zhang, Honglei;Qiao, Haixia;Zhang, Xiaoyun;Jia, Tianjun;Han, Shuguang;Gao, Yuan;Xiao, Hongyuan;Yang, Hejie",2017-01-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Titanium substitution in Gd2Zr2O7 for thermal barrier coating applications,"The study underlines the impact of Ti4+ substitution in Gd2Zr2O7 for applications in thermal barrier coatings (TBC). Depending on the Ti4+ content, two different crystal structures of Gd2Zr2O7 namely pyrochlore and fluorite were determined. Ti4+ substitutions in the increasing order induced a gradual contraction of Gd2Zr2O7 unit cell; however, with the accomplishment of concentration dependent crystal structures of either single phase pyrochlore or mixtures of pyrochlore and fluorite. Absorption measurements enunciated the enhanced infra-red reflectance behaviour of Gd2Zr2O7 due to Ti4+ substitutions. A gradual increment in the concentration of Ti4+ substitutions in Gd2Zr2O7 envisaged a simultaneous porous to dense morphological features, which reflected in the resultant mechanical data. Hot corrosion studies ensure the critical role of Ti4+ to retain the crystal structure of Gd2Zr2O7.","Ponnilavan, V.;Aravind, A.;Ezhilan, M.;Kannan, S.",2019-09-30,Ceramics International,"Gd2Zr2O7,Titanium,Pyrochlore,Fluorite,Thermal barrier coatings",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.176,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.176
Vapour phase synthesis and characterisation of Cf/SiC composites with self-healing Si-B-C monolayer coating,"Carbon fibre reinforced CVI-SiC matrix (Cf/SiC) composite is well known for its superior properties such as low density, high specific modulus, high fracture toughness, and high temperature mechanical properties. In the present work, 2.5-Directional Cf/SiC composites with (PyC/SiC) n=4 multilayer interface having two different thicknesses with a density of ~2.1 g cm-3 are prepared through isobaric isothermal chemical vapour infiltration technique. High temperature tensile properties of the prepared composites with and without Si-B-C seal coating are studied and the results are presented. Samples prepared without seal coat exhibited a KICof ~ 30 MPa m1/2, and tensile strength of ≥200 MPa at room temperature. Si-B-C seal coated Cf/SiC composites has shown significant increase (28%) in high temperature tensile strength at 1200 °C and 1500 °C respectively compared to uncoated composites.

In vitro characterization of porous calcium phosphate scaffolds capped with crosslinked hydrogels to avoid inherent brittleness,"Ductile composite scaffolds can avoid being crushed during filling processes in clinical applications. Thus, this study aimed to modify brittle porous ceramic scaffolds into ductile scaffolds through hydrogel capping. The surfaces of calcium phosphate (CaP) ceramic scaffolds were effectively capped with alginate/gelatin hydrogels. The composite scaffolds were then crosslinked, subjected to vacuum drainage, and washed prior to lyophilization. The detailed controlled approach in this study was proposed with the aim to develop biocompatible composites with anisotropic open pores through the formation of a thin, homogenous, hydrogel film coating on porous ceramic scaffold surfaces. The performances of the hydrogel/CaP composite scaffolds were evaluated on the basis of their morphological characteristics, compressive strengths, and cell viabilities. Results showed that strength, toughness, and specimen integrity after cracking are strongly related to the concentration of the hydrogel cap. Strength testing results showed that the use of 50vol% alcohol as the crosslinker removal solution yielded scaffolds with high toughness and ductility. Moreover, the cracked specimen dipped in 50vol% alcohol possessed better integrity than that dipped in water only. This study successfully identified the optimal hydrogel quantity for the fabrication of biocompatible scaffolds with open connective pores. The advantages of the fabricated scaffolds indicate the relevance of the proposed method to clinical applications, such the production of fillers for successful alveolar bone augmentation.","Chang, Chin-Wei;Wu, Yu-Ren;Chang, Kai-Chi;Ko, Chia-Ling;Lin, Dan-Jae;Chen, Wen-Cheng",2018-02-01,Ceramics International,"Morphologies,Calcium phosphates,Hydrogels,Porous scaffold,Bone substitutes",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.077,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.077

CO2 laser-assisted preparation of transparent Eu2Ti2O7 thin films,"We present a laser-assisted preparation of transparent europium-titanate Eu2Ti2O7 thin films with tailored structural and optical properties. We have evaluated the effects of the irradiation time on the structural and the optical properties of the films. This approach allows the preparation of nanocrystalline crack-free films and micro patterns. The amorphous thin films were prepared by a sol-gel method. The films were annealed by a CO2 laser beam for various time intervals. The laser irradiation induced a crystallization process that resulted in the formation of Eu2Ti2O7 nanocrystals. The nanocrystals regularly grew with increasing irradiation time reaching the size from 25 nm to 45 nm. A film of a thickness 480 nm exhibited an optical transmission of 91.9% that is close to the maximal theoretical limit. The film's refractive index at 632 nm was 2.26. A micrometric pattern was prepared by a direct laser writing followed by a wet chemical etching. Feasibility of the demonstrated approach, together with the high film's quality, and europium-titanate chemical resistivity open up many opportunities for advanced applications. The approach can be used for a preparation of protective coatings and integrated photonic devices such as planar optical waveguides and couplers.","Mrázek, Jan;Aubrecht, Jan;Todorov, Filip;Buršík, Jiří;Puchý, Viktor;Džunda, Robert;Vytykáčová, Soňa;Kašík, Ivan",2018-06-01,Ceramics International,"Laser processing,A.

Corrosion behavior of Y2O3-doped mullite-ZrSiO4 coatings applied on C/C–SiC composites in the presence of moisture at temperatures of 1373–1773 K,"Commercial mullite powders show great potential for application in environmental barrier coatings. However, most of the commercial mullite powders contain amorphous silica, which produces volatile silicon hydroxide in hot steam. This leads to serious recession of mullite coatings in hot water vapor. In this study, a Y2O3-doped mullite-ZrSiO4 coating was fabricated on C/C–SiC composites using the slurry painting method. The addition of Y2O3 resulted in the elimination of the residual silica and derived-cristobalite in the commercial mullite powder, leading to the formation of a stable mullite-Y2Si2O7–ZrSiO4 coating. This indicates that Y2O3 can efficiently enhance the phase stability of commercial mullite at high temperatures. In addition, the corrosion behaviours of Y2O3-doped mullite-ZrSiO4 coatings were investigated at 1373, 1573, and 1773 K in a 95% H2O-5% O2 atmosphere. The coatings exhibited good corrosion resistance. The 15 mol% Y2O3 coating showed a weight loss rate of 1.62 wt % when exposed to hot steam for 10 h at 1573 K. This value is only 1/8th of that of the uncoated sample. Moreover, ZrSiO4 improved the water corrosion resistance of the Y2O3-doped mullite-ZrSiO4 coatings at 1573 K.","Qian, Tianxiao;Zeng, Yi;Xiong, Xiang;Ye, Ziming;Lun, Huilin;Hu, Jinrun;Wang, Yalei;Zhang, Zhongwei;Yan, Changhai",2020-06-01,Ceramics International,"Environmental barrier coating,Commercial mullite,Mullite-Y2Si2O7–ZrSiO4 coating,Water vapor corrosion behaviour",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.124,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.124
Surface defects repairing of sprayed Ca-P coating by the microwave-hydrothermal method,"The increasing interest in decreasing the surface defects of sprayed Ca-P coating deposited on carbon/carbon (C/C) composites to enhance the bonding strength, bioactivity and corrosion resistance of the coating is justified by the growing evidence of its beneficial effect on the bone replacement fields. Microwave-hydrothermal (MH) method detailed in the previous study is successfully used to reduce the above coating defects and the MH mechanism is well studied here. Hence, five different treatment reagents involving calcium and phosphorus solution, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) solution, ammonium hydroxide (NH3·H2O) solution, only Ca2+ solution and deionized water are selected as the precursor solution. The surface, cross-sectional morphologies, phase and composition of the coatings are characterized by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), microscopy Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra. Elastic modulus and coating hardness are measured by nanoindentation. Results reveal that the presence of calcium and phosphorus ions, as well as the H2SO4 in the precursor solution during the MH process, have a positive influence on the reduction of sprayed Ca-P coating surface defects. However, the coating treated by other three solutions cannot produce new phases on the basis of sprayed Ca-P coating and the surface defects of it are not decreased. Nevertheless, the elastic modulus and hardness of the coating treated by H2SO4 solution are very weak. MH treated coating by calcium and phosphorus ions in the precursor solution and in NH3·H2O solution, only Ca2+ solution and deionized water own the similar elastic modulus and hardness to that of the sprayed Ca-P coating. To conclude, in the MH process, the surface defects of the sprayed Ca-P coating are only lowered in calcium and phosphorus precursor solution and the coating strength is not dropped, which demonstrates the promoting mechanism of MH process.","Su, Yangyang;Li, Kezhi;Hou, Xianghui;He, Song",2018-12-01,Ceramics International,"Surface repairing,Sprayed Ca-P coating,Microwave-hydrothermal treatment,Precursor solution,Carbon/carbon composites",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.258,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.258
Hertzian stress analysis and characterization of thermal barrier coatings containing unidirectional vertical cracks,"Finite element method (FEM) analysis and experimental studies are conducted for designing thermal barrier coatings using yttria-added gadolinium zirconia (Y-GZO) and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) under indentation contact stresses. The designed thermal barrier coating contains unidirectional vertical cracks (UDCs) to alleviate stress when subjected to thermal cycling or thermal shock. The optimal bilayer thermal barrier coating comprises porous YSZ as the bottom layer and dense Y-GZO material containing UDCs as the top layer. To investigate the advantages of bilayer thermal barrier coatings containing UDCs, the thermal and mechanical durability of the bilayer coatings are compared with those of a single-layer-coated YSZ without UDCs. Modeling and FEM analysis show that the thermal barrier coating containing UDCs shows stress alleviation contours under the same indentation load. Additionally, the coatings containing UDCs with different sequences of dense and porous layers exhibit excellent advantages from the viewpoint of stress relaxation. Results show that the bilayer thermal barrier coatings containing UDCs exhibit better durability against interface delamination during thermal cycling and thermal shock tests in comparison with single-layer coating without UDCs. The bilayer thermal barrier coating containing UDCs exhibit good mechanical behavior since the modulus of elasticity and hardness remain unchanged during thermal shock cycling and exhibit excellent abrasion resistance. These results show that a durable coating layer can be designed as a thermal barrier coating for gas turbines.","Lee, Dong Heon;Lee, Kee Sung;Kim, Tae Woo;Kim, Chul",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,Unidirectional vertical crack,Thermal durability,Mechanical properties,Indentation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.121,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.121
Synergistic effect of silane modified nanocomposites for active corrosion protection,"This work presents an effective anticorrosion behavior of a hydrophobic surface on stainless steel 304. The protective coating has been designed by dispersing nanocomposites (cloisite 15A, multiwalled carbon nanotubes and cerium chloride) which act as a corrosion inhibitor. The sol was prepared by using 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS), octyltriethoxysilane (OTES) and zirconium (IV) butoxide as precursors. The corrosion resistance of coated stainless steel got improved when nanocomposites were homogeneously embedded in silica sol. The influence of nano-particles on the barrier coatings impedes corrosion. The coatings were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) to ensure the intercalation and distribution of nanocomposites in layered silicates. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was employed to characterize the nanocomposites modified silica sol. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the morphology of the modified silane coating. The contact angle measurements ensured the hydrophobic behavior of the coatings. The corrosion behavior was investigated using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). This study has led to a better understanding of active anticorrosive coatings with embedded nanocomposites and the factors influencing the anticorrosion performance.","Jeeva Jothi, K.;Palanivelu, K.",2013-09-30,Ceramics International,"A.

Novel synthesis and characterization of silicon carbide nanowires on graphite flakes,"Silicon carbide nanowires were synthesized on the surface of graphite by partially reacting with silicon powders in NaF–NaCl based salt at 1150–1400°C in argon. The effects of temperature and time of heat treatment as well as Si/graphite ratio on synthesis of SiC nanowires were studied. The results showed that the formation of SiC nanowires started at about 1200°C, and the amounts of SiC nanowires increased in the resultant powders with increasing temperature. Their morphologies were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. It was found that β-SiC nanowires with diameter of 10–50nm and various lengths grew along their preferred direction perpendicular to (111). The zeta potential of graphite was also increased after coating with silicon carbide nanowires. SiC nanowires that formed on the graphite surface acted as an anti-oxidant to a certain extent, and they protected the inner graphite from oxidation.","Ding, Jun;Deng, Chengji;Yuan, Wenjie;Zhu, Hongxi;Zhang, Xiaojun",2014-04-30,Ceramics International,"Silicon carbide nanowires,Graphite,Molten salt,Synthesis",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.08.051,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.08.051
Improvement of biomedical functionality of titanium by ultrasound-assisted electrophoretic deposition of hydroxyapatite-graphene oxide nanocomposites,"Herein, we improved the biomedical functionality of titanium by deposition of hydroxyapatite (HA)-graphene oxide (GO) nanocomposites using the ultrasound-assisted electrophoretic technique. Ti sheets were anodized in a well-optimized condition and subsequently were coated in suspensions of HA-GO with various compositions (0, 1, and 3 wt% of GO). Hardness, crack resistance, adhesion, hydrophilicity, corrosion, and bioactivity of the coatings were evaluated. The results showed that the addition of GO substantially improves the mechanical properties, particularly coating with 1 wt% GO demonstrated the best-reported adhesion strength so far (3.65 ± 0.33Gpa). The integration of GO in the coatings also leads to an enhancement in the hydrophilicity of the Ti, with 3 wt% GO coating reaching a very low contact angle of 31°. The corrosion resistance of the sample coated with 1 wt% GO was higher than that of sample without GO. However, further addition of GO (3 wt%) deteriorated the corrosion resistance. Finally, the coating with 1 wt% GO presented excellent bioactivity behavior, as its Ca/P ratio (1.62) was very close to that of natural bone (1.67).","Fardi, Sajede Roueini;khorsand, Hamid;Askarnia, Reza;Pardehkhorram, Raheleh;Adabifiroozjaei, Esmaeil",2020-08-01,Ceramics International,"Titanium,Graphene oxide,Hyrdoxyapatatite,Ultrasound-assisted electrophoretic deposition (EPD),Biomedical functionality",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.049,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.049
Heat treatment of nanostructured thermal barrier coating,"A nanostructured thermal barrier coating has been prepared by air plasma spraying using YSZ (8wt% Y2O3 partially stabilized zirconia) nano powder. The effect of annealing on the nanostructured zirconia coating has been investigated. The grain size of the nanostructured zirconia coating increased with increasing annealing time and temperature. Grains grew with preferential direction and into a columnar structure. The growth activation energy in the nanocrystalline grains is very low, which comes from existence of micro-pores in the coating and the grain-rotation-induced grain coalescence (GRIGC) mechanism.","Wang, Na;Zhou, Chungen;Gong, Shengkai;Xu, Huibin",2007-08-31,Ceramics International,"Nanostructure,Annealing,Thermal barrier coating,Plasma spraying",10.1016/j.ceramint.2006.03.022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2006.03.022
Effect of heat treatment on structures and corrosion characteristics of electroless Ni–P–SiC nanocomposite coatings,"Ni–P–SiC nanocomposite coatings were successfully deposited onto mild steel substrates. The coating process was performed by sealing the specimens in an evacuated tempered glass tube and heated at various temperatures of 200°C for 2h, 400°C for 1h, and 600°C for 10min. The effect of heat treatment on the structures and corrosion characteristics of the electroless Ni–P–SiC nanocomposite coatings was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Vickers hardness, cyclic polarization, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses. AFM and XRD results indicate that the optimum grain diameters of Ni and SiC in the as-plated Ni–P–SiC nanocomposite coatings are approximately 96.8 and 49.1nm, respectively. The maximum microhardness for the as-plated Ni–P–SiC nanocomposite coatings is 968.3HV. The highest microhardness is achieved for the samples heat treated at 600°C for 10min because of the precipitation of Ni x P y phases and the formation of an inter-diffusional layer at the substrate-coating interface. The lowest corrosion current density value is obtained for the coatings heat treated at 400°C for 1h. EIS data confirm these results.","Ma, Chunyang;Wu, Feifei;Ning, Yumei;Xia, Fafeng;Liu, Yongfu",2014-08-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Design of functionalized α-Fe2O3 (III) films with long-term anti-wetting properties,"The design of functional anti-wetting ceramic coatings is always a bottleneck restricting the development of ceramic techniques. This study proposes a liquid phase synthesis method to fabricate α-Fe2O3 (III) ceramic powders with promising applications and introduces a facile electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique to construct the corresponding functionalized hydrophobic films – superhydrophobic functionalized α-Fe2O3 ceramic films (SFOFS) with roughly even distribution and a high water contact angle (CA) of 169°±1° – followed by heat posttreatments. The microtopography and crystalline structures of the product were investigated by FESEM, EDX, and XRD techniques. The EPD controllability of SFOFS was studied by adjusting the EPD time and the applied field strengths. In addition, the SFOFS show excellent long-term anti-wetting properties for twenty-four months after undergoing a series of tests, including soaking, water droplet impacting, immersion by droplets with different surface tensions and exposure to different gases and relative humidity conditions, etc. This study substantially helps the design of other kinds of functional anti-wetting films through the proposed convenient method beyond the oxide limit.","Liang, Taotao;Guo, Xiaogang;Yuan, Binfang;Kong, Shuying;Huang, Huisheng;Fu, Daoling;Zhang, Fulan;Xu, Jianhua;Li, Xueming",2020-04-01,Ceramics International,"Functionalized α-Fe2O3 (III) ceramic films,Liquid phase synthesis,EPD,Long-term anti-wetting",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.077,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.077
Use of interphase in geopolymer matrix composites for improved toughness,"Geopolymers are a lightweight material with excellent fire and thermal resistance. When combined with continuous fiber reinforcement, geopolymers demonstrate potential to replace heavier, structural components, especially those that are exposed to elevated temperature regimes (> 400 °C) in air. Oxidation resistance is essential to continuous operations in these environments. While oxide fibers can drastically improve the mechanical properties of geopolymers, their incorporation has been met with challenges. These geopolymer matrix composites (GMC) lack the necessary toughness to find much use as a structural component. In this study, concepts and materials used to reduce interfacial strength in ceramic matrix composites for the purpose of improving toughness are employed in GMCs. To investigate the potential to improve toughness, composites containing an alumina-based fiber and geopolymer were prepared with three different interfacial conditions: heat cleaned, carbon coated, and monazite coated. From the fabricated composites, specimens for four-point flexural testing and single fiber pushout were prepared. Additionally, composite samples were heat treated to 650 °C in oxidizing and non-oxidizing environments. To varying degrees, composites that utilized a fiber coating demonstrated improvements in toughness and relative damage tolerance as compared to those without any modification to the interface. In some cases, the improvement was over 160% as compared to those without a coating. Pushout testing showed specimens with coated fiber to have weaker interfacial conditions. The combined results support the use of tailored interface concepts in GMCs for improving toughness.","Jackson, Patrick R.;Parthasarathy, Triplicane A.;Ross, Aric;Radford, Donald W.",2019-03-31,Ceramics International,"Geopolymer,Monazite,Ceramic matrix composite,Interphase",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.076,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.076

Multi-functional ceramic-coated separator for lithium-ion batteries safety tolerance improvement,"The separator is used to isolate the cathode and anode material, playing an important role in the safety of battery, which prevents internal short circuit of battery and provides lithium ions free flow channels. In this paper, based on the commercial ceramic-coated polyethylene (PE) separator (CPES), low-melting point PE microspheres were mixed in ceramic-coating to form the functionalized PE separator (FPES) for improving the safety tolerance of large scale lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Compared to the CPES shutdown temperature of ~135 °C, the shutdown temperature of FPES significantly decreased to ~110 °C. Compared with 27 Ah pouch battery assembled by CPES, the FPES can effectively improve the tolerance of overcharge and internal short circuit without sacrificing the electrochemical performance. In addition, a novel internal short circuit of FPES protection mechanism model was proposed. Molten PE microspheres of FPES would flow along the edge of broken hole, reducing the contact probability between the cathode and anode, and ultimately increasing the resistance of internal short circuit by 41% compared to CPES. Therefore, the obtained results provide important implications for the development of safer separator and LIBs.","Chen, Xiaobo;Chen, Shilong;Lin, Yongshou;Wu, Kai;Lu, Shigang",2020-10-15,Ceramics International,"Shutdown property,Separator,High temperature overcharge,Internal short circuit,Lithium-ion battery",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.259,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.259
Atomic layer deposited-ZnO@3D-Ni-foam composite for Na-ion battery anode: A novel route for easy and efficient electrode preparation,"The sluggish kinetics of relatively larger Na-ion still limits the performance of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) as compared to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). In this context, a novel route is introduced by coating a thin films of ZnO on a porous 3D Ni-foam scaffold by atomic layer deposition (ALD) for the first time and is used as a superior anode for SIBs without any post-modifications. The scanning electron microscopy along with transmission electron microscopy studies reveal that highly crystalline ZnO can be deposited on such complex 3D Ni-foam with excellent uniformity and conformality. A stable reversible capacity of ~ 65.1 mAh g−1 up to 400 charge-discharge cycles and the excellent rate capability in a wide current density range (30–1000 mA g−1) establish the potential of this composite prepared by a direct and relatively easier method of electrode fabrication. The predominant alloying-dealloying based reactions for Zn-based anode material is also established in SIBs by the post-cycling X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analyses. The post-cycling analysis of these anodes also reveals the robust structure with good adhesion of the ALD grown films on Ni-foam. In addition, similar study on 2D substrate elucidates the extra advantages of this current strategy. This model efficient route can easily be extended and adopted for any other materials to further enhance the performance of SIBs in future.","Sinha, Soumyadeep;Didwal, Pravin N.;Nandi, Dip K.;Cho, Jae Yu;Kim, Soo-Hyun;Park, Chan-Jin;Heo, Jaeyeong",2019-01-31,Ceramics International,"Atomic layer deposition,Na-ion battery,Anode,ZnO@Ni-foam composite,Cycling stability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.289,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.289
Synthesis and room-temperature multiferroic properties of lead-free Bi4Ti3O12/NiFe2O4 nanocomposite films,"Lead-free Bi4Ti3O12/NiFe2O4 nanocomposite films have been prepared via sol-gel spin-coating route. The successful phase formation of orthorhombic Bi4Ti3O12 and cubic NiFe2O4 has been confirmed using x-ray diffraction without any detectable extra phase. The scanning electron microscopy with EDS measurement reveals homogeneous and dense growth of both phases accompanied by clear interface between the two layers. The loop of magnetization versus magnetic field indicates the ferromagnetic properties at room temperature with saturation magnetization of ~257.48 emu/cm3, coercive field of ~121 Oe and remnant magnetization of ~57.03 emu/cm3. Room-temperature ferroelectric behavior is also obtained along with the good fatigue endurance properties and low leakage current density. The frequency dependence of dielectric constant displays the monotonous decreasing tendency with low dielectric loss. Moreover, evident magnetodielectric behavior is achieved in the nanocomposite films at room temperature. The coexistence of ferromagnetic and ferroelectric behavior including the appearance of magnetodielectric effect proves the room-temperature multiferroic properties in Bi4Ti3O12/NiFe2O4 nanocomposite films, which makes the films meaningful as the lead-free multiferroic systems for device applications at room temperature.","Wang, L.G.;Yu, G.B.;Zhu, C.M.;Yao, M.W.;Liu, F.C.;Kong, W.J.",2020-07-31,Ceramics International,"Multiferroic properties,Lead-free,Bi4Ti3O12,NiFe2O4,Nanocomposite films",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.281,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.281
LaMgAl11O19 synthesis using non-hydrolytic sol-gel methods,"Polycrystalline LaMgAl11O19 (LMA) was prepared by four different non-hydrolytic sol-gel methods. From stable solutions, four powder precursors containing an amorphous and nanocrystalline phase with specific reactivity were obtained. The particle size, morphology, thermal behaviour, and phase composition of the powder precursors were studied using DLS, TEM, DSC/TG and XRD. Bulk ceramic samples containing LMA were prepared at 1200 °C for 16 h and examined in terms of phase purity and microstructure using XRD, SEM, and TEM. Raman spectroscopy of pure LMA was used to study the structure in detail. A mechanism of LMA formation and a relation between powder precursor properties and final phase composition is proposed.

Improved toughness of layered architecture TiAlN/CrN coatings for titanium high speed cutting,"Fracture toughness is an important characteristic for coatings for high speed cutting of titanium. This study focuses on improving the fracture toughness of the coatings using a layered design method. TiAlN/CrN multilayer coatings with bilayer periods between 12nm and 270nm were prepared by reactive magnetron sputtering. XRD results show the multilayer coatings have face-centred cubic structures. When the bilayer period of multilayer coating decreases from 270nm to 25nm, the coating hardness decreases from 24.5GPa to 18.1GPa. Increased fracture toughness and adhesion strength of multilayer coatings are observed with decreasing bilayer periods. A maximum fracture toughness (KIC) of 3.6MPam1/2 and adhesion strength of 107 N were obtained with a 25nm bilayer period. The inhibition of crack propagation is the main reason for the high fracture toughness values in multilayer coatings. However, when the bilayer period is decreased further (12nm), the coating hardness begins to increase rapidly to 23.4GPa, and the fracture toughness and adhesion strength begin to decrease. Titanium cutting results show that an improvement in cutting performance is obtained with a TiAlN/CrN_25 multilayer coating.","Sui, Xudong;Li, Guojian;Jiang, Chenjie;Wang, Kai;Zhang, Yingjie;Hao, Junying;Wang, Qiang",2018-04-01,Ceramics International,"Layered design,Fracture toughness,Bilayer period,Titanium cutting",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.210,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.210
Influence of surface treatments on topography and bond strength of densely-sintered zirconium-oxide ceramic,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of surface treatments on the roughness and bond strength of dental materials containing MDP to zirconium oxide ceramic. Forty square-shaped zirconium-oxide ceramic blocks (Lava Zirconia, 3M-ESPE) were treated as follows: (CT) polished only; (SB) sandblasting (110µm aluminum oxide particles) or (SC) silica coating (110µm particles). Roughness of treated surface was measured using a profilometer (Ra) and by atomic force microscope (AFM). Two resin luting agents were used after silane application: self-adhesive (Rely X U200, 3M-ESPE) and dual cure (Rely X Ultimate, 3M-ESPE). The samples were submitted to microshear bond strength test. The failure analysis was performed. Data were submitted to ANOVA and Tukey test (α=0.05). Bond strength results ranged from 20.44 (CT+Ultimate) to 34.37MPa (SC+U200) after 24h and from 12.03 (CT+Ultimate) to 27.44MPa (SC+U200) after 12 months of storage with SC statistically superior to the other treatments. Mean values of roughness varied from 0.07 (CT) to 0.85µm (SC). The both resin luting agents showed similar results to all surface treatment groups. Silica coating provided the best treatment of the ceramic surface.","Silva, Gabrielle Alencar Ferreira;da Luz, Elidineide Cruz;dos Reis Goyatá, Frederico;da Silva Concilio, Lais Regiane;Neves, Ana Christina Claro;Vitti, Rafael Pino;Cunha, Leonardo Gonçalves",2016-05-15,Ceramics International,"B.

Cr2O3 nanoparticles: A promising candidate to improve the mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of Ni-Co alloy coatings,"This study was aimed to assess the effects of reinforcement nanoparticles content, on the microstructural features, mechanical properties, and corrosion-related properties of Ni-Co-Cr2O3 nanocomposite coatings. Scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis were employed in order to evaluate the microstructural features and chemical composition of the nanocomposites. Moreover, the microhardness tester and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) tests coupled with potentiodynamic polarization measurements were used to investigate the mechanical and corrosion-related properties, respectively. Results demonstrate that albeit the volume fraction of cobalt in coating, average particle size, Cr2O3 nanoparticle content in coating, and microstructural features are of prime significance in determining the mentioned properties of the nanocomposite coatings, Co content is more important. Actually, Cr2O3 nanoparticles serve as suitable nucleation sites for Co particles deposition throughout the microstructure. Thus, combined actions of Cr2O3 nanoparticles incorporation and their optimal content ensures the nucleation of high population of Co particles, which significantly contributes to the improvement in the properties. The Ni-Co-8.9wt%Cr2O3 nanocomposite coating exhibits the superior mechanical and corrosion-related properties.","Rasooli, Ali;Safavi, Mir Saman;Kasbkar Hokmabad, Mehdi",2018-04-15,Ceramics International,"Ni-Co-Cr2O3 nanocomposite coating,Electrodeposition,Mechanical properties,Microstructural features,Corrosion-related properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.044,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.044
Optimization and erosion wear response of NiCrSiB/WC–Co HVOF coating using Taguchi method,"In this work, high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) thermal spraying was used to develop 65wt% NiCrSiB–35wt% WC–Co coatings on AISI 304 stainless steel substrate. Taguchi method was taken to optimize the spray parameters like oxygen flow rate, fuel flow rate, powder feed rate and standoff distance to obtain better erosion resistance at 90° impact angle. Standoff distance and powder feed rate were identified as the highly contributing parameters on the erosion wear loss. The important sequence of the spray parameter is standoff distance>powder feed rate>fuel flow rate>oxygen flow rate. The combination of 220lpm of oxygen flow rate, 65lpm of fuel flow rate, 28g/min of powder feed rate and 300mm of standoff distance was identified as the optimum condition for minimum erosion wear loss. The microstructure of the optimized coating was characterized using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) equipped with Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), Optical microscope (OM), and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The microhardness, porosity and surface roughness of the coating was also measured. Finally, erosion wear testing of the optimized coating was conducted at 30°, 60° and 90° impact angle using hot air jet erosion testing machine.

Y3Ce7Ta2O23.5 and Yb3Ce7Ta2O23.5—Two kinds of novel ceramics for thermal barrier coatings,"For the development of ceramic candidates for thermal barrier coatings, two kinds of new ceramics, Y3Ce7Ta2O23.5 and Yb3Ce7Ta2O23.5, were synthesized by sintering at 1873 K for 10 h. The obtained samples were composed of a single fluorite-type phase, and their relative densities are greater than 90%. Because of phonon scattering caused by the complex lattice, the large number of oxygen vacancies, and substituted atoms, the thermal conductivity is lower than that of 8YSZ. The coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) of these two products are located in the range of 10.22–12.57 × 10−6/K and 9.62–12.66 × 10−6/K, respectively, from 323 K to 1473 K, and they also exhibit excellent phase stability up to 1473 K.

A novel and facile impregnation-combustion fabrication of spherical CoAl2O4 supported on sepiolite nanofibers,"In this study, sepiolite nanofibers-supported spherical CoAl2O4 composites were prepared by a novel and facile impregnation-combustion method, using nitrates and sepiolite minerals as the raw materials. The results showed that the optimal process for the nanocomposites formation was an impregnation step facilitated by stirring for 24 h at room temperature coupled with a calcination step performed at 300 ℃ for 6 h. The characterizations by XRD, SEM and BET revealed that the CoAl2O4 particles were dispersed evenly on the surface of the sepiolite nanofibers with a complete crystal shape and uniform particle size, and the specific surface area has been improved significantly by adopting the sepiolite nanofibers as the support. Therefore, the sepiolite nanofibers-supported spherical CoAl2O4 composites with a good dispersion and suspension performance are a promising candidate in the fields of water-based coatings, heterogeneous catalytic reactions, ceramic materials, and so on.","Zhang, Tingting;Wang, Fei;Liang, Jinsheng;Fang, Baizeng;Gao, Peizhang;Gao, Guiyang;Zhang, Hui;Zhang, Ze",2018-11-30,Ceramics International,"Sepiolite nanofibers,Spherical CoAl2O4,Ceramics,Calorimetry combustion,Impregnation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.197,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.197
A facile route to graphite-tungsten nitride and graphite-molybdenum nitride nanocomposites and their ORR performances,"The use of various advanced functional ceramics has been widely implemented in various fields, yet still limited in energy-based fields, such as regenerative fuel cells. Here, a two graphite covered metal nitride nanoparticle ceramic (graphite-tungsten nitride and graphite-molybdenum nitride nanocomposites) was synthesized via a one-step solid phase method. TEM photographs show ~10nm ceramic particles and a clear carbon coating layer. Such a novel carbon coating layer was further confirmed to be graphite via Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Raman spectra of as-prepared samples displayed unique structural defects of the graphite layer, giving it excellent capability of oxygen molecule capture. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) polarization curves obtained from linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) via rotating disk electrode (RED) showed ORR activity (via a two-electron pathway) of both G-Mo2N and G-WN. Subsequently, the durability of G-Mo2N and G-WN were tested via chronoamperometry, in which both samples retained more than 80% of their initial current after 10,000s, allowing for the material to overcome the shortcomings of traditional ceramic materials including low conductivity, inferior catalytic activity and unsatisfactory durability.","Pan, Xiaolong;Song, Xinhang;Lin, Sen;Bi, Ke;Hao, Yanan;Du, Yinxiao;Liu, Jun;Fan, Dongyu;Wang, Yonggang;Lei, Ming",2016-11-01,Ceramics International,"Tungsten nitride,Molybdenum nitride,Nanocomposites,Oxygen reduction reaction",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.109,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.109
Corrosion behaviour of plasma sprayed graphene nanoplatelets reinforced hydroxyapatite composite coatings in simulated body fluid,"Hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings, reinforced with varied concentration (0–2 wt%) of Graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) have been deposited on titanium alloys (Ti–6Al–4V) substrate using atmospheric plasma spraying. Present work studies the effect of GNP concentration on the electrochemical behaviour of the HA coatings in simulated body fluid (SBF). The HA coating exhibited 15% porosity, whereas reinforcement of 1 wt% GNPs in HA (HA-1G) shows 13% porosity, further addition of 2 wt% GNPs in HA reduced the porosity to 10%. Reduction in porosity was achieved as GNPs easily accessed the inter-lamellae to fill the gaps at inter splat region and minimized the occurrence of post-plasma spray defects such as porosity, voids, microcracks etc. These consequences nextward resulted in the significant enhancement in corrosion resistance of the matrix. HA-1G displayed a significant reduction by 67% in the corrosion rate in SBF solution, while this reduction came to 87% for HA-2G coatings. Randomly oriented wrinkles in the GNPs after corrosion process and their hydrophobic nature effectively hindered the SBF infiltration into the coating and resisted their movement towards the underlying substrate. This in turn improved the overall corrosion resistance of the system.","Singh, Swarnima;Pandey, Krishna Kant;Islam, Aminul;Keshri, Anup Kumar",2020-06-15,Ceramics International,"Plasma spraying,Hydroxyapatite,Graphene nanoplatelets,Corrosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.139,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.139
"Impact of cathode loss on plasma characteristics, microstructures and properties of 7YSZ coatings in PS-PVD","The slight changes in geometry and mass of the cathode of O3CP plasma torch during service life caused the variety of arc motion between the cathode and anode. The voltage appeared to rise first and then fall. In this experiment, the impact of cathode loss on plasma characteristics, microstructures and properties of 7YSZ coatings was investigated. Optical emission spectroscopy (OES) was used to characterize the plasma jet characteristics such as plasma temperature and electron number density. It is found that vapor deposition is the main deposition mechanism, and the microstructures of the coatings are mainly affected by the supersaturation and subcooling of the vapor phase, which determine the nucleation and growth of crystals. At the middle of cathode service life, the plasma temperature and electron number density are the highest and the powder is completely evaporated. High crystal growth rates and surface diffusion lead to large columnar crystals with large grain size. The best thermal shock resistance. The thermal shock resistance is the best in this case. When the cathode is in the beginning and end of service life, there are columnar grains with small size produced and many solid particles in the gaps due to diffusion difficulties generated by low temperature. Shadowing enhances to manufacture fine grains and few branches. The presence of solid particles prevents the release of thermal stress and reduces thermal shock resistance of coatings. Fine grains prevent cracks propagation to improve the bonding strength of coatings.","Zhang, Yan;Deng, Changguang;Mao, Jie;Luo, Zhiwei;Deng, Ziqian;Zhang, Xiaofeng;Deng, Chunming",2020-06-15,Ceramics International,"(PS-PVD),Plasma spray-physical vapor deposition,(OES),Optical emission spectroscopy,Plasma jet characteristics,Cathode loss,YSZ powder evaporation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.109,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.109
In situ synthesis of α-alumina layer at top yttrium-stabilized zirconia thermal barrier coatings for oxygen barrier,"The thermally grown oxide (TGO) at the interface of a ceramic-bond coating plays an important role in the failure of the thermal barrier coating (TBC).

SIE consists of glass film deposition on the Y-TZP surface before glass removal with 10% hydrofluoric acid etching. This study's objective was to investigate the effects of SIE protocol steps on Y-TZP topography and its consequence on its bond strength to resin cement. The SIE protocol was divided into two main steps: silica coating (first step) and glass dissolution by hydrofluoric acid (second step), and the null hypothesis was that the SIE treatment has the same bond quality independently of the HF exposition time. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electron and Transmission Electron microscopy were used to characterize the zirconia surfaces. The bond strength was evaluated by the interfacial fracture toughness test, and data were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey's Test (5%). As the main result, it was shown that, when exposed during sufficient time, the 10% HF can etch zirconia at room temperature, which is responsible for topographic changes, significantly improving the bond quality. Additionally, no glass components or dihedral angles modifications were observed at Y-TZP grain boundaries after silica coating. With the study limitations, it was possible to infer that the surface-modifying agent in SIE protocol is the HF etching, and the null hypothesis was rejected.","Steling Rego, Maria Eliza;Nunes Guimarães Paes, Paula;Ribeiro da Silva Schanuel, Fabiana;Mendes Jardim, Paula",2020-10-19,Ceramics International,"Yttria stabilized tetragonal zirconia,Dental ceramics,Failure analysis,Interfacial fracture toughness,Surface treatment",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.103,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.103
Effects of solvents on the tribological behaviour of sol–gel Al2O3 films,"Thin films of Al2O3 and modified Al2O3 were prepared on a glass substrate by dip coating process from specially formulated aqueous/ethanol sols. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetric analysis (DSC) of precursor gels were performed to explore the thermal events occurring during the annealing process of the sol–gel Al2O3 films. The morphologies of the unworn and worn surfaces of the films were analyzed by atomic force microscope (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The chemical composition of the film was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The tribological properties of the films sliding against Si3N4 ball were evaluated on a one-way reciprocating friction and wear tester. AFM and XPS results confirm that the solvents can influence the structure and composition of the film significantly. The film from ethanol solution process shows longer wear life than the one from distilled water solution, especially under lower load. The added polyethylene glycol (PEG) modifier in sols generates totally different effects on the tribological behaviour of the films with respect to solvents. The addition of PEG to ethanol solution deteriorates the wear resistance of the corresponding film. Differently, the wear resistance of the modified film from aqueous solution is significantly improved. Actually, the modified film from water solution shows the best wear resistance among all the films. The wear mechanisms of the films are discussed based on SEM observation of the worn surface morphologies. Results show that brittle fracture and severe abrasion dominates the wear of glass substrate. The wear of the film from aqueous solution is characteristic of micro-fractures, the corresponding modified film shows better plasticity and fewer micro-cracks, whereas, the wear of the film from ethanol solution was characterized by abrasive and slight plastic deformation, and the corresponding modified one shows evidence of abrasive and brittle fracture.","Zhang, Wenguang;Liu, Weimin;Wang, Chengtao",2003-12-31,Ceramics International,"D.

Atmospheric plasma sprayed silica–hydroxyapatite coatings on magnesium alloy substrates,"Silica-doped hydroxyapatite as a bioactive coating presents some advantages compared to the pure one, such as: increased in vivo bioactivity and early bone ingrowth. The aim of this study is to obtain a deposition of silica-doped hydroxyapatite on magnesium alloy plates by atmospheric plasma spraying. The coating material was prepared by a precipitation method with sodium silicate addition as a source of silica, and various methods were used to characterize it. Spraying conditions including powder feed rate and current values were varied. The coating properties were defined by determining the purity, phase composition, morphology and corrosion protection of the HAP–Si deposits on the magnesium plates.","Bogya, Erzsébet Sára;Károly, Zoltán;Barabás, Réka",2015-05-31,Ceramics International,"Silica–hydroxyapatite,Plasma spraying,Magnesium alloy,Bio-protective coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.041,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.041
Ablation resistance of TaC-modified HfC coating prepared by supersonic plasma spraying for SiC-coated carbon/carbon composites,"A HfC-TaC composite coating was prepared on SiC-coated C/C composites by supersonic atmosphere plasma spraying (SAPS) to improve their ablation resistance. The ablation resistance was evaluated under oxyacetylene torch with heat flux of 2.38 MW/m2 and 4.18 MW/m2 respectively, and the effect of TaC on microstructure and phase composition of the coating was investigated. Results showed that TaC-modified HfC coating exhibited good ablation resistance under the torch with heat flux of 2.38 MW/m2 and its mass and linear ablation rates were -0.35 mg/s and -1.05 μm/s separately, which is ascribed to the formation of continuous oxide film including phases like Hf6Ta2O17 and Ta2O5. Crack propagation in the coating was inhibited due to the phase transition restriction of HfO2 by Ta2O5, and cracks and holes in the oxide layer could be repaired by molten Ta2O5 and Hf6Ta2O17. However, the occurrence of ablation crater on the surface of HfC-TaC coating is mainly attributed to the unsatisfactory scouring resistance of the oxide film under heat flux of 4.18 MW/m2.","Feng, Guanghui;Li, Hejun;Yao, Xiyuan;Chen, Miaomiao;Xue, Yibei",2019-10-01,Ceramics International,"H6Ta2O17,Carbon/carbon composites,Ablation performance,Supersonic atmospheric plasma spraying,HfC-TaC coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.011
Research of in situ modified PS-PVD thermal barrier coating against CMAS (CaO–MgO–Al2O3–SiO2) corrosion,"Feather-like columnar structured 7YSZ thermal barrier coating (TBC) was prepared by plasma spray-physical vapor deposition (PS-PVD). An aluminum (Al) film was deposited on the TBC surface by magnetron sputtering. The Al-deposited TBC was vacuum heat-treated at 665°C, 808°C and 900°C for 1h separately. Then an α-Al2O3 layer was observed on the top of 7YSZ coating, which resulted from in situ reaction of Al and ZrO2 at high temperature under vacuum condition. The microstructure evolution and phase composition of the TBC were characterized by FE-SEM and XRD respectively. The CMAS (CaO–MgO–Al2O3–SiO2) corrosion property of as-sprayed and treated Al-deposited TBC was compared, which was conducted at 1200°C for 24h. The results show that the Al-deposited TBC after vacuum heat treatment have better CMAS corrosion resistance than the as-sprayed TBC.","Song, Jinbing;Zhang, Xiaofeng;Deng, Chunming;Deng, Changguang;Liu, Min;Zhou, Kesong;Tong, Xin",2016-02-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,PS-PVD,Aluminum,In situ synthesis,CMAS corrosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.10.106,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.10.106
Effect of TGO thickness on the thermal barrier coatings life under thermal shock and thermal cycle loading,"Effect of thermally grown oxide (TGO) thickness on thermal shock resistance of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) and also their behavior under a cyclic loading (including aging at maximum temperature) was evaluated experimentally. In order to form different thicknesses of TGO, coated samples experience isothermal loading at 1070 °C for various periods of times. Heat-treated samples were heated to 1000 °C and cooled down rapidly in water from the substrate side using a mechanical fixture. The life of samples was investigated as a function of TGO thickness. Furthermore, by performing an experiment the simultaneous effect of the TGO growth and thermal expansion mismatch– on the failure of thermal barrier coatings was evaluated. The results demonstrated that the presence of TGO with a thickness of 2–3 µm has a positive effect on the resistance against thermal shock.","Torkashvand, Kaveh;Poursaeidi, Esmaeil;Mohammadi, Maryam",2018-06-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal shock,Thermal cycling,TGO thickness,Thermal barrier coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.140,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.140
"Effects of bias voltage on microstructure, mechanical properties, and wear mechanism of novel quaternary (Ti, Al, Zr)N coating on the surface of silicon nitride ceramic cutting tool","In this study, a novel quaternary (Ti, Al, Zr)N coating was successfully fabricated via multi-arc ion plating (MAIP) technique on the Si3N4 ceramic substrate. During the MAIP process, a combination of Ti target, Zr target, and AlTi target was used. Four groups of (Ti, Al, Zr)N coatings were produced with different bias voltages (50, 100, 150, and 200V) but the same target current. The effect of the pulsed bias voltage on the microstructure, mechanical properties, and wear mechanism of the (Ti, Al Zr)N coating was investigated in order to optimize the cutting performance of PVD coated ceramic cutting tool. The results of turning tests indicated that the dominant wear mechanism for the cutting tool prepared at the bias of 50V was abrasive and fatigue wear. The mechanisms were the combination of adhesive wear and abrasive wear when the bias was increased from 100 to 200V. It is believed that this study provides a new perspective to understand the critical role of bias voltage of MAIP for the quaternary coatings on Si3N4 cutting tools.","Liu, Wei;Li, Anqiong;Wu, Haidong;He, Rongxuan;Huang, Jiawei;Long, Ying;Deng, Xin;Wang, Qimin;Wang, Chengyong;Wu, Shanghua",2016-11-15,Ceramics International,"C.

Thermophysical properties of Ln3Ce7Ta2O23.5 (Ln= Nd and La) composite oxides,"La3Ce7Ta2O23.5 and Nd3Ce7Ta2O23.5 ceramics were obtained adopting a solid-state fritting method from La2O3, Nd2O3, Ta2O5 and CeO2 as original materials. The lattice compositions, microstructures, and thermophysical performances were investigated. The analytical results indicate that the obtained bulk samples are approximately composed of 2LnTa0.5Ce2.5O8.25 and LnTaCe2O7 (Ln = Nd and La), which also show relatively dense microstructures with uneven grain-size distributions. Owing to the higher ionic-radius of La3+ than that of Nd3+, the La3Ce7Ta2O23.5 exhibit greater coefficient of heat dilation than Nd3Ce7Ta2O23.5. The obtained products also present higher heat-insulation properties than YSZ due to large atomic weights, high oxygen vacancies, complicated phase compositions, and complex element constitutions. The thermophysical performances for the fabricated products meet the demands for applications of thermal barrier coatings.","Xiaoge, Chen;Hongsong, Zhang;Yuping, Tong;Xianfeng, Yang;Weiwei, Sang;Haoming, Zhang;Yongtao, Zhao",2020-05-31,Ceramics International,"Phase-structure,Coefficient of thermal expansion,Thermal conductivity,Rare earth tantalite",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.136,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.136
Thermodynamic and microstructural analyses of photocatalytic TiO2 from the anodization of biomedical-grade Ti6Al4V in phosphoric acid or sulfuric acid,"TiO2 coatings were fabricated by anodization of Ti6Al4V in 1 M H3PO4 or H2SO4, at room temperature at 120 V for 10 min, and followed by annealing at 300° or 500 °C for 8 h. Analyses include mineralogy (GAXRD, Raman), chemistry (XPS), morphology and microstructure (FESEM, FIB, 3D confocal microscopy), thermodynamic, optical (UV–Vis), and photocatalytic performance (MB degradation). The present work highlights factors that govern the nature of the materials and their performance. The influence of the oxidation strength of the acid is pervasive in that it impacts on the crystallinity, microstructural homogeneity, coating thickness, Ti3+ concentration, gas generation during arcing to form pores, and resultant pore size and distribution density. A key observation is that the pores form a subsurface network of variable continuity, which has a significant impact on the surface area and associated density of photocatalytically active sites, access by liquids and gases inside the coating, penetration depth of incident radiation, gas condensation, and residual liquid trapping. These data and the related thermodynamic analyses of the acids, anodization processes, and oxidation processes facilitate the generation of schematic models for the anodization mechanisms and the resultant surface, bulk, and microstructural effects that dominate the photocatalytic performance.","Cheung, Keng Ho;Pabbruwe, Moreica Beatrice;Chen, Wen-Fan;Koshy, Pramod;Sorrell, Charles Christopher",2020-09-01,Ceramics International,"Thermodynamic,Microstructure,Electrolyte,Anodization,TiO2,Photocatalysis",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.277,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.277
Thermal stability and optical properties of low emissivity multilayer coatings for energy-saving applications,"In this study, the deposition and characteristics of Si- and Ti-series multilayer coatings with respective glass/Si3N4/NiCr/Ag/NiCr/Si3N4 and glass/TiO2/ZnSnO3/ZnO/Ag/NiCrOx/ZnSnO3/Si3N4 structures were investigated. Experimental analyses were performed, and the optical performance and thermal stability of the coatings were assessed. The as-deposited Si- and the Ti-series samples exhibited optimal shading coefficient of 0.49 and 0.57, respectively. Thermal annealing in air was performed to analyze the thermal stability and oxidation resistance of the samples. The Si- and Ti-series samples prevented the failure of low-emissivity properties at 700 and 600 °C, respectively. In addition to high transparency, the Si-series samples exhibited improved low-emissivity properties, reduced light pollution, and superior thermal stability compared to the Ti-series samples. The use of Si3N4 and NiCr layers effectively prevented the oxidation and cracking of the Ag layer upon heat treatment. This study presents the characteristics of Si- and Ti-series samples for energy-saving building applications.","Tsai, Du-Cheng;Chang, Zue-Chin;Kuo, Bing-Hau;Chen, Erh-Chiang;Huang, Yen-Lin;Hsieh, Tsung-Ju;Shieu, Fuh-Sheng",2020-04-15,Ceramics International,"Coating materials,Thin films,Vapor deposition,Optical properties,Transmission electron microscopy,TEM",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.021
Vertically oriented graphene nano-sheets grown by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition technique at low temperature,"In this study, it was aimed to obtain vertically-oriented graphene nano-sheets (VGNs) on copper foils using CH4 gas as the precursor material by means of plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) technique. VGNs were obtained at 50 W, 75 W and 100 W Radio Frequency (RF) powers by this technique and the effect of RF power on the morphological structure of graphene layers was investigated. VGNs were also analyzed by Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and water contact angle (WCA) measurements. The SEM images showed that the VGNs became more tightly packed with the increase of RF power and thus these coating parameters had a significant effect on the morphological structure. WCA analyzes for VGNs were also performed and it was found that VGNs obtained at 100 W RF power had higher contact angle value than the other RF powers. These VGNs, which have both large surface area and optically transparent, are thought to be materials that have the potential to be used in supercapacitors and solar cells.","Bayram, Ozkan;Simsek, Onder",2019-08-01,Ceramics International,"Vertically-oriented graphene,Raman,PECVD",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.034,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.034
Synthesis and characterization of mica/γ-Ce2−xYxS3 composite red pigments with UV absorption and high NIR reflectance,"Environmentally benign red mica/γ-Ce2−xYxS3 composite pigments were synthesized by the deposition of γ-Ce2−xYxS3 pigments on mica so as to improve their color and optical properties. Comprehensive analyses were performed to characterize the obtained pigments, including XRD, SEM, TG-DSC, UV–vis–NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and CIE 1976 L*a*b* color scales. The results revealed that spherical Ce2−xYxS3 particles were coated on the surface of mica uniformly, and the doped γ-Ce2−xYxS3 exhibited single-phase cubic crystal structure as γ-Ce2S3. Moreover, chromatic properties (L*, a*, b* and C*) and thermal stability of mica/γ-Ce2−xYxS3 pigments were all better than that of pure γ-Ce2S3. The obtained mica/γ-Ce2−xYxS3 pigments showed strong ultraviolet shielding ability and color stability. Besides, they exhibited higher near-infrared reflectance and solar reflectance than those of pure γ-Ce2S3. The above results indicated that these red pigments have potential to be used as ‘cool pigments’ in energy saving and UV protection areas.","Zhang, Shuting;Ye, Mingquan;Chen, Shunlu;Han, Aijun;Zang, Yao",2016-11-01,Ceramics International,"γ-Ce2−xYxS3,Coating,NIR reflectance,UV absorption,Composite pigment",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.111,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.111
Preparation of multifunctional drug sustained-release system by atomic layer deposition of ZnO in mesoporous titania coating,"In previous studies, it has been proven that properties of titanium mesoporous (MP) coatings have a strong bond to substrates and excellent anti-stripping property, thus making it ideal for clinical implants. Also, the high porosity and specific surface area of MP material make it excellent for drug loading and sustained release. However, compared with untreated titanium, the bioactivity of MP samples does not have a significant improvement. In this study, we deposited zinc oxide (ZnO) into/on MP structures using atomic layer deposition (ALD) technology, which would significantly improve the biological activity of MP material while maintaining its structures. The fluorescence results showed that the porosity and drug loading capacity had little change after 10 ALD cycles (MP-ALD10), but decreased significantly after 30 ALD cycles (MP-ALD30). Cell results showed that with the increase of ALD cycle (from 0 to 50), the cytocompatibility of the corresponding materials increased first and then decreased: the optimal proliferation and differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells were observed in MP-ALD10 and MP-ALD30 groups, respectively. Moreover, it was found that the antibacterial properties of different MP samples against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus gradually enhanced with the increase of ZnO (MP < MP-ALD10 < MP-ALD30 < MP-ALD50). Overall, the study proved that 10 cycles of ZnO deposition significantly enhanced the bioactivity of MP without affecting its structure, drug-loading and drug-releasing properties, thus making MP-ALD10 more suitable for the development of drug-device combined titanium implants than MP.","Wu, Xinghai;Yao, Litao;Al-Baadani, Mohammed A.;Ping, Linchao;Wu, Shuyi;Al-Bishari, Abdullrahman M.;HiiRuYie, Kendrick;Deng, Zhennan;Liu, Jinsong;Shen, Xinkun",2020-05-31,Ceramics International,"Titanium,Mesoporous,Atomic layer deposition,Zinc oxide,Antibacterial,Osteogenesis",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.201,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.201
The enhanced bactericidal effect of plasma sprayed zinc-modified calcium silicate coating by the addition of silver,"Our previous work demonstrated the antibacterial activity of plasma sprayed zinc-modified calcium silicate coating. To enhance the bactericidal effect, in this paper, silver and zinc co-incorporated calcium silicate coating (ZC0.3-Ag) was fabricated onto Ti–6Al–4V substrate via plasma spraying technology. The coating was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the silver nanoparticles 10–100nm in diameter were randomly distributed in the amorphous matrix after the silver modification. In chemical durability test, the ZC0.3-Ag coating presented improved chemical stability when compared with that of the original and Ag-doped coating. In vitro antibacterial study indicated that the inactivation of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) on the ZC0.3-Ag coating was significantly enhanced compared to that on the Zn-modified coatings. The enhanced bactericidal activity was attributed to the addition of silver. Cytocompatibility evaluation demonstrated that the ZC0.3-Ag coating surface supported the adhesion and spreading of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), and no significant cytotoxicity was observed for the coating.","Li, Kai;Xie, Youtao;Ao, Haiyong;Huang, Liping;Ji, Heng;Zheng, Xuebin",2013-09-30,Ceramics International,"B.

A novel template-free wet chemical synthesis method for economical production of zinc oxide microrods under atmospheric pressure,"This work reports a template-free wet chemical synthesis method for economical production of zinc oxide (ZnO) microrods by using an inexpensive polypropylene beaker as a reactor under atmospheric pressure. The morphology and crystal structure of the as-prepared ZnO microrods were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and Raman scattering. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Ultraviolet–visible (UV/Vis) spectroscopy and methylene blue photocatalytic degradation test were also conducted to study their physical and chemical properties. The results show that the as-prepared ZnO microrods have a hexagonal crystal structure. Under the optimal synthesis condition, they have a diameter of 0.8–2.6 μm and a length of 10–40 μm. Compared with commercial ZnO powders, the as-prepared ZnO microrods have a higher whiteness. Meanwhile, the as-prepared ZnO microrods have very low photocatalytic activity, indicating that they have good photostability and are unlikely to cause the photodegradation of polymers such as binders. As a result, they will be an excellent and economical white pigment with great potential in coating applications.","Chiu, Ka-lok;Shang, Songmin;Wang, Yuxiang;Jiang, Shouxiang",2020-02-01,Ceramics International,"ZnO microrods,Atmospheric pressure,Wet chemical synthesis method,Grain size,Polypropylene beaker",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.179,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.179
Phase structure and thermal conductivities of Er2O3 stabilized ZrO2 toughened Gd2Zr2O7 ceramics for thermal barrier coatings,"3.5mol% Er2O3 stabilized ZrO2 (ErSZ) and Gd2Zr2O7 powders were produced by a chemical co-precipitation and calcination method, and ErSZ was used to toughen Gd2Zr2O7. The phase structure, toughness and thermal conductivities of ErSZ toughened Gd2Zr2O7 ceramics were investigated. When the ErSZ content was below 15mol%, the compound consisted of pyrochlore phase, the ordering degree of which decreased with the increase of the ErSZ content. High ErSZ doping led to the formation of metastable tetragonal (t′) phase in the compound. The addition of ErSZ in Gd2Zr2O7 benefited its toughness, mainly attributable to the presence of t′ phase in the compound. With the increase of the ErSZ content in the compound, the thermal conductivity first decreased and then showed an upward tendency, and 10mol% ErSZ toughened Gd2Zr2O7 exhibited the lowest thermal conductivity.","Li, Mingzhu;Guo, Lei;Ye, Fuxing",2016-11-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs),Ceramics,Phase structure,Toughness,Thermal conductivity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.079,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.079
Effect of Cr content on the microstructure and thermal properties of ZrSi2–CrSi2–SiC multiphase coating for the SiC coated C/C composites,"A series of ZrSi2-CrSi2-SiC multiphase coatings with different Cr content in the pack powders were prepared on the surface of the SiC coated carbon/carbon (C/C) composites by pack cementation in argon.

Hollow-structured Fe3O4@SiO2 nanoparticles: Novel synthesis and enhanced adsorbents for purification of plasmid DNA,"Fe3O4 @SiO2 core–shell-structured nanoparticles are expected to act as nanoabsorbents or nanocarriers because of the magnetic properties of the internal Fe3O4 and the inherent properties of the external SiO2. Plasmid DNA, a small class of nucleic acid, is isolated and purified by the SiO2 surface of magnetic beads. Improvement of the specific surface area of the SiO2 coating layer under specified conditions greatly contributes to the purification performance of the material. As a means to achieve this, one way to maximize the surface area is to create a hollow structure by adding a coating layer. However, the process and environmental burdens associated with fabricating a hollow structure are some of the obstacles that currently prevent utilization of this method. This study proposes a novel synthesis method based on the use of water‐soluble surfactant, which can form an interlayer while simultaneously acting as a bridge between a core and a shell. The morphology changes of the SiO2 layer depending on the crosslinking agent content were investigated, and the optimal conditions for hollow-structure generation were established. The improved surface properties dramatically improved the purification efficiency of plasmid DNA.","An, Gye Seok;Chae, Dong Ho;Hur, Jae Uk;Oh, Ah Hyun;Choi, Hyun-Hee;Choi, Sung-Churl;Oh, Yoon-Suk;Jung, Yeon-Gil",2018-10-15,Ceramics International,"Magnetite,Hollow structure,Core–shell nanoparticles,CTAB,Plasmid DNA purification",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.111,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.111

Photoactive multilayer WO3 electrode synthesized via dip-coating,"This work describes a multilayer tungsten oxide photoanode synthesized via facile dip-coating deposition solution for sunlight-driven water oxidation reaction. The number of layers (three, five and ten) followed by a successive annealing process at each deposited layer has strongly influenced their performance. The ten-layers tungsten oxide photoanode exhibited the highest photocurrent density around 0.7 mA/cm2 at 1.23 VRHE, under sunlight irradiation. This photocurrent response corresponds to 17% of solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (STH) from the maximum theoretical predicted for tungsten oxide (4.8%). The successive annealing treatment promoted a reduction in the number of grain boundaries, yielding in higher film porosity and surface roughness, which decreased the charge transfer resistance and the electron-hole recombination rate.","Ferrari, Victoria C.;Dupim, Ivaldete S.;Sousa, Vinicius;Souza, Flavio L.",2018-12-15,Ceramics International,"Sol-gel processes,Transition metal oxides,Grain growth,Electrodes",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.097,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.097
Enhanced luminescent performance for remote LEDs of Ce:YAG phosphor-in-glass film on regular textured glass substrate by using chemical wet-etching,"A novel route to modify the luminescent performances of Ce:YAG phosphor-in-glass (PiG) film is proposed in this work, where the yellow-emitting PiG film was placed on regularly nanoscale textured glass substrate through spin coating technique. Different from the mechanical scraping, the regularly textured surface substrate is successfully obtained using hydrofluoric acid solution (HF 48–51%) by chemical wet-etching method and the roughness can be modified by adjusting synthesis time. The textured glass substrate can not only improve the optical uniformity and enhance luminous efficacy by minimizing total internal reflection (TIR), but reinforce the diffuse reflection light to improve visual comfort. The research results show that the quantum yield (QY) and luminous efficacy of the film based w-LEDs on textured glass substrate increase by 22.9% and 11.18%, respectively. These results may bring an inspiring insight to prepare remote phosphor with different spectral performance on regularly textured surface for remote white LEDs.","Xu, Lingzhi;Zhao, Guoying;Meng, Shaohua;Fang, Yongzheng;Hou, Jingshan;Liu, Yufeng;Liao, Meisong;Zou, Jun;Hu, Lili",2018-12-15,Ceramics International,"Phosphor in glass film,Regular textured glass substrate,Chemical wet-etching method,Phosphor-converted LED",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.351,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.351
"Fabrication of silicon carbonitride-covered boron nitride/Nylon 6,6 composite for enhanced thermal conductivity by melt process","The surface-treated boron nitride (BN) particles are prepared with polysilazane (PSZ) by using a dip-coating method to fabricate a thermally conductive interface material. PSZ-BN particles are generated by crosslinking of PSZ on BN and heat treatment of the formed PSZ-BN at700 °C to convert PSZ-BN to SiCNO-BN. The SiCNO-BN particles are fabricated with Nylon 6,6 by using an extruder and injection molding method. The interfacial adhesion between the BN particles and the Nylon 6,6 matrix is enhanced by surface treatment of the BN particles. The surface-treated BN/Nylon 6,6 composites exhibit thermal conductivity ranging from 0.3270 to 0.4230W/mK (through-plane) and 1.6510 to 4.960W/mK (in-plane), which is higher than that in the case of loading with pristine BN/Nylon 6,6 composites at the same weight fraction.

HA/β-TCP plasma sprayed coatings on Ti substrate for biomedical applications,"The present work focuses on the fabrication of βTCP (β-tricalcium phosphate) and HA/βTCP (hydroxyapatite/β-tricalcium phosphate) composite coatings by plasma spraying. The starting powders were produced via solid-state method using 2wt% MgO to stabilize βTCP phase. The synthesized powders were preliminarily granulated to be used by the plasma spray process. Coatings obtained on titanium substrates are uniform and well adherent but due to the high temperature and cooling rate typical for plasma spraying process, βTCP phase is almost totally transformed into the α allotrope. Thermal treatment at 800°C allows the reconversion of the phase αTCP→ βTCP. It is therefore possible to produce coatings with tuneable dissolution properties by selecting the proper initial powder mixture and the specific thermal treatment.","Pillai, Rahul Sasidharan;Frasnelli, Matteo;Sglavo, Vincenzo M.",2018-02-01,Ceramics International,"Hydroxyapatite,Tricalciumphosphate,Plasma spray coating,Biomedical application",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.113,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.113
Low-temperature fabrication of sol–gel NiO film for optoelectronic devices based on the ‘fuel’ of urea,"In this work, NiO coating is fabricated by a low temperature ‘combustion process’ driven by ‘chemical oven’ on quartz and indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates followed by an annealing process in air at 225°C for 2h. The NiO coating is analyzed by means of thermalgravimetric differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electric microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscope (AFM), and UV–visible spectrometer.

Sol-gel processed high-k aluminum oxide dielectric films for fully solution-processed low-voltage thin-film transistors,"High-k oxide dielectric films have attracted intense interest for thin-film transistors (TFTs). However, high-quality oxide dielectrics were traditionally prepared by vacuum routes. Here, amorphous high-k alumina (Al2O3) thin films were prepared by the simple sol-gel spin-coating and post-annealing process. The microstructure and dielectric properties of Al2O3 dielectric films were systematically investigated. All the Al2O3 thin films annealed at 300–600 °C are in amorphous state with ultrasmooth surface (RMS ~ 0.2 nm) and high transparency (above 95%) in the visible range. The leakage current of Al2O3 films gradually decreases with the increase of annealing temperature. Al2O3 thin films annealed at 600 °C showed the low leakage current density down to 3.9 × 10−7 A/cm2 at 3 MV/cm. With the increase of annealing temperature, the capacitance first decreases then increases to 101.1 nF/cm2 (at 600 °C). The obtained k values of Al2O3 films are up to 8.2. The achieved dielectric properties of Al2O3 thin films are highly comparable with that by vapor and solution methods. Moreover, the fully solution-processed InZnO TFTs with Al2O3 dielectric layer exhibit high mobility of 7.23 cm2 V−1 s−1 at the low operating voltage of 3 V, which is much superior to that on SiO2 dielectrics with mobility of 1.22 cm2/V−1 s−1 at the operating voltage of 40 V. These results demonstrate that solution-processed Al2O3 thin films are promising for low-power and high-performance oxide devices.","Xia, Wenwen;Xia, Guodong;Tu, Guangsheng;Dong, Xin;Wang, Sumei;Liu, Rui",2018-06-01,Ceramics International,"High-k dielectrics,Metal oxides,Sol-gel,Thin-film transistor,Low-voltage,Solution deposition",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.120,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.120

After annealing under 500–600°C in air, Al2O3–BST composite oxide film was formed on the surface of the etched aluminum foil by anodizing galvanostatically in a neutral adipite and borate solution. The BST powders annealed under different temperatures were characterized by TG–DTA and X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the specific capacitance of the coated samples annealed under different temperatures and times was measured. It was experimentally shown that the specific capacitance of the samples with BST coating is greater than without BST coating. The composite films are promising to be used as the dielectric of electrolytic capacitor.","Xu, Youlong",2004-12-31,Ceramics International,"A. Sol–gel processes,A. Films,B.

Preparation and properties of anti-static coating on the 3Y-TZP ceramics,"Anti-static coating on the 3Y-TZP ceramics was prepared through adding ZnO and SnO2 to the glaze. Wettability and surface resistivity of the coating was studied. Dissolving, crystallization and distribution of ZnO and SnO2 in the coating were analyzed. Static dissipative mechanism of the coating was explored. The results showed that the interface bonding and wetting between the coating and 3Y-TZP were perfect. The surface resistivity of the coating could be reduced to 107 Ω/□. ZnO was helpful to improve the wettability of the coating and inhibit the crystallization of the SiO2. ZnO and SnO2 dissolved in the glaze and the semi-conductive composition rich melt layer around SnO2 was formed. The melt layer contacted each other and the static dissipative network was established, which attributed to the anti-static properties of the coating.","Yang, Xianfeng;Ni, Zhentao;Yang, Xiaole;He, Qinglong;Xie, Hehan;Xu, Xiewen;Xie, Zhipeng",2018-10-01,Ceramics International,"Anti-static,Surface resistivity,Coating,Surface modification",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.060,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.060
Effect of alternating current electric field on microstructure and properties of laser cladding Ni–Cr–B–Si coating,"The effects of alternating current (AC) on the morphology, microstructure and property of the laser cladding Ni–Cr–B–Si coatings were studied. The experimental results showed that the surface morphology of the coating was wavy due to the skin effect and the alternating electromagnetic force produced on the surface of the molten pool under the action of the AC. Electric field could increase the nucleation rate and refine grain size, thus the structure in the bottom of the coating transformed from dendrite to equiaxed crystal. However, alternating current did not change the phase type in the coating. Furthermore, due to the refinement of the grain structure at the bottom of the coating, the number of cracks in the coating was reduced by 60%. The average microhardness of the coating increased, and the corrosion resistance was also improved under the AC electric field.","Zhai, Lulu;Wang, Qian;Zhang, Junwei;Ban, Chunyan",2019-10-01,Ceramics International,"Laser cladding,AC electric field,Microstructure,Microhardness,Crack,Corrosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.230,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.230
Synthesis of hollow TiO2@SiO2 spheres via a recycling template method for solar heat protection coating,"The development of a simple and environmentally friendly method to synthesize hollow TiO2 structures is urgent for realizing high NIR reflectance and low thermal conductivity. Hollow TiO2@SiO2 structures have been successfully synthesized by a recycling template method. The synthesis process involves four steps as follows: 1) preparation of SiO2 spheres, 2) synthesis of SiO2@TiO2 core-shell structure by coating mesoporous TiO2 shell on SiO2 and crystallization by calcination, 3) etching the SiO2@TiO2 to form the hollow TiO2 spheres, and 4) coating the hollow TiO2 spheres with a SiO2 protection layer to produce hollow TiO2@SiO2 structures. The SiO2 serves as a template to support and synthesize hollow TiO2 shell, and then after being etched, to form a Na2SiO3 solution as a coating agent to protect TiO2 shell from photocatalytic activity. The as-synthesized hollow TiO2@SiO2 structures not only have high NIR reflectance, but also have a high thermal barrier performance due to the hollow structure. Moreover, the NIR reflectance of the coating made from hollow TiO2@SiO2 reached 94.9%, and the temperature of the inner surface of the coating board is reduced about 16 °C, compared with the surface without coating. The weather resistance studies reveal that the hollow TiO2@SiO2 sample is very stable under the UV irradiation. In particular, the hollow TiO2@SiO2 structures synthesized by using this method shows multifunctional responses towards solar heat.","Li, Li;Chen, Xinhong;Xiong, Xia;Wu, Xiaoping;Xie, Zinan;Liu, Zuohua",2020-09-15,Ceramics International,"SiO2@TiO2,TiO2@SiO2,Near-infrared reflectance,Thermal insulation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.117,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.117
High temperature mechanical and thermal properties of CaxBa1-xZrO3 solid solutions,"The excellent high temperature phase stability enables the perovskite BaZrO3 to be a promising candidate for thermal barrier coatings (TBCs).

They have moderate mechanical properties and their residual Young's moduli at 1473 K are around 80% of the values at room temperature. Compared with BaZrO3, CaxBa1-xZrO3 solid solutions have decreased thermal conductivities which are comparable to those of YSZ and other potential TBCs materials. Among these solid solutions, Ca0.25Ba0.75ZrO3 exhibits the lowest thermal conductivity that is in the range from 2.06 W ⋅ m - 1 ⋅ K - 1 to 2.52 W ⋅ m - 1 ⋅ K - 1 . Meanwhile, CaxBa1-xZrO3 solid solutions have higher thermal expansion coefficients than that of BaZrO3.

Synthesis of carbon coated-ceria with improved cytocompatibility,"In this study, we developed a one-step method for the convenient preparation of carbon-coated CeO2 using inductively coupled plasma technology. The carbon-coated CeO2 nanoparticles were obtained using cerium nitrate solution as precursor and ethanol as carbon source. The thickness of the carbon coating was modified by varying the flow rates of oxygen in the sheath gas. The average size of the nanoparticles obtained was around 10 nm, which was similar to that of the uncoated one. However, the content of Ce3+ was slightly increased after the coating with enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capability. In order to evaluate the cytocompatibility of coated CeO2, two kinds of cell lines, macrophage and keratinocyte, were experimented. The carbon-coated CeO2 exhibited much higher cytocompatibility than that of the uncoated one. Marginal toxicity was found when cells were treated with coated CeO2, whereas the death ratio of macrophages was around 11% after 24 h of treatment with 5 μg/ml of bare CeO2. Our results indicate that carbon coating may be a promising substitute for polymer modification of CeO2 in order to improve its cytocompatibility and anti-oxidative properties.","Chen, Zhaoming;Xie, Youtao;Li, Kai;Huang, Liping;Zheng, Xuebin",2019-11-30,Ceramics International,"Carbon coated ceria,Biomedical application,Inductively coupled plasma",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.256,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.256
Microstructure characteristics of silicon carbide coatings fabricated on C/C composites by plasma spraying technology,"A functional gradient SiC coating on C/C composites has been developed using a novel process which is the combination of plasma spraying technology with reaction-formed heat-treatment. Microstructure observation and phase identification of the SiC coatings were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Experimental results showed that a uniform silicon coating was deposited on C/C composite by plasma spraying technology. The reaction between the silicon coating and C/C substrate occurred during the heat-treatment at temperature of 1450°C and 1600°C in argon environment, respectively. A continuous SiC coating was formed on the surface of the C/C substrate. And a layer of SiC/C convention layer was formed on the near-surface area of the substrate, which was resulted from the molten silicon penetrating into the open pores and consequently reacting with the C/C composites.

Ablation mechanism of WC-SiC double layer coating under oxyacetylene torch test,"A WC-SiC double-layer coating was prepared on C/C composites to improve their anti-ablation property. The WC outer layer was designed to withstand high heat flux by its high mechanical strength, the SiC inner layer could transform into SiO2 to block oxygen by its good anti-oxygen permeability. During ablation process, amounts of SiO2 filled into the pores and cracks of WC outer layer, forming a steadily self-filling and cooling structure. As a result, the mass and linear ablation rates of WC-SiC coated C/C composites were 0.013mgs−1 cm2 and −1.61µm/s, respectively. Compared with single SiC coated and single WC coated C/C composites, the linear ablation rates decreased by 46.3% and 27.3%, respectively, indicating that WC-SiC coating has a remarkable effect to resist chemical and mechanical ablation.","Guo, Ling-jun;Peng, Jian;Kou, Gang;Huo, Cai-xia;Li, He-jun;Li, Ke-zhi",2016-11-15,Ceramics International,"Tungsten carbide,Silicon carbide,Carbon/carbon composites,Double-layer structure,Ablation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.171,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.171

The results showed that the outer coating consists of smooth non-angular TaB2 phase, regular hexagonal prism shape TaC phase and SiC phase, which are synchronously obtained during the preparation of the coating. The multilayer coating could protect the C/C composites against oxidation for 400h at 1773K in air with only 1.43% weight loss. A double self-healing oxidation layers (inner SiO2 glass layer and outer compound Ta–Si–O silicate glass layer) formed on the surface of the coating provides a dual oxidation protection for the coating, which was responsible for the excellent oxidation resistance.","Ren, Xuanru;Li, Hejun;Fu, Qiangang;Li, Kezhi",2014-08-31,Ceramics International,"B.

Oxidation behavior of CVD star-shaped TiN coating in ambient air,"Star-shaped 800-TiN and 850-TiN coatings were deposited on the surface of 310S stainless steel foils by CVD and their oxidation behavior was investigated in ambient air, from 300°C to 800°C for 1800s by XRD, SEM, EDX and Raman spectroscopy. Initial oxidation of 850-TiN coating with a partial color change occurs at 350°C, remarkable oxidation of 850-TiN coating occurring between 400°C and 450°C. The EDX results show that obvious oxidation of 850-TiN starts at 400°C with about 9 at% oxygen detected; no N atoms could be detected while the O content reaching a maximum of ca. 70% at oxidation temperature above 700°C. The XRD and Raman results show that only rutile-TiO2 formed on the surface of oxidized TiN coating. The oxidation of star-shaped TiN coating can be divided into three stages. In the case of mild oxidation (below 500°C), TiN coating can maintain the star-shaped microstructure although oxygen diffuses into the TiN lattice resulting in replacement of N by O atoms. For moderate oxidation (550–600°C), the star-shaped microstructures start to crack along the (111) twin planes, and the boundary of particles remains clear with oxide and oxynitride layer coexisting on the surface of 850-TiN coating. For severe oxidation (650–750°C), the cracks of the star-shaped microstructures start to expand and become apparent, meanwhile the boundary of particles become uncertain. After oxidizing at 800°C, the 850-TiN coating will lose efficacy due to the bad spalling resistance.","Tang, Shiyun;Wang, Jianli;Zhu, Quan;Chen, Yaoqiang;Li, Xiangyuan",2015-09-30,Ceramics International,"Star-shaped TiN,Oxidation behavior,Color changes,Rutile-TiO2,Spalling resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.04.014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.04.014

The phase structure, ablation surface morphology and reflectivity of the coating were characterized by XRD, SEM, and UV–Visible-near Infrared Spectroscopy. During laser irradiation, the tantalum oxide coatings experience three stages: coating oxidation, micro-cracks occurrence and mechanical failure.

Annealing processes were carried out at different temperatures in an Ar atmosphere to improve the microstructure and properties of the coatings. The microstructure of the TiN coatings as-sprayed and annealed in Ar was observed, and their fracture toughness was calculated on the basis of diamond indentation tests. The highest fracture toughness was obtained from coating annealed in Ar at 800°C. The wear resistance of these samples was enhanced by more than 25% compared with the as-sprayed coating. The reasons for the improvements in toughness and wear resistance are discussed.","Dong, Yanchun;Yang, Yong;Chu, Zhenhua;Zhang, Jianxin;He, Jining;Yan, Dianran;Li, Dongyang",2017-08-15,Ceramics International,"TiN coating,Nano-grained coating,Microstructure,Wear resistance,Annealing",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.091,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.091
Thermal stability of plasma-sprayed La2Ce2O7/YSZ composite coating,"A composite coating composed of La2Ce2O2 (LCO) and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) in a weight ratio of 1:1 was deposited by the plasma spraying using a blended YSZ and LCO powders, and the stability of the LCO/YSZ interface exposed to a high temperature was investigated. The LCO/YSZ deposits were exposed at 1300°C for different durations. The microstructure evolution at the LCO/YSZ interface was investigated by quasi-in-situ scanning electron microscopy assisted by X-ray energy-dispersive spectrum analyses and X-ray diffraction measurements. At an exposure temperature of 1300°C, the grain morphology of LCO splats in contact with YSZ splats changed from columnar grains to quasi-axial grains with interface healing, and some grains tended to disappear during the thermal exposure. The results indicate that the phases in LCO–YSZ composite coating are not stable at 1300°C. The element La in the LCO splat diffused towards the adjacent YSZ splat during the exposure, generating the reaction product layers composed of La2Zr2O7 between the LCO and YSZ splats. After exposed for 200h, the composite coating consisted of a mixture of mainly La2Zr2O7 and CeO2 and a minor amount of YSZ, accounting for the unusual decrease in the thermal conductivity at the late stage of exposure.","Xu, Ya-Xin;Liu, Tao;Yang, Guan-Jun;Li, Chang-Jiu",2016-05-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Plasma spraying,Yttria-stabilized zirconia,La2Ce2O7,Interface stability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.01.179,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.01.179
"Dielectric, ferroelectric properties and photoconductivity effect of sol-gel grown SrTiO3/BaTiO3 thin film heterostructure","SrTiO3/BaTiO3 (ST/BT) thin-film heterostructure was deposited on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si(100) substrate by spin-coating. X-ray diffraction pattern shows that the heterostructure is a perovskite structure composed of ST and BT without any impurity peaks. The dielectric constant and loss of the heterostructure at 10 kHz are 704 and 0.024, respectively. The electric-field dependence of dielectric response was investigated and the tunability of the sample under 200 kV/cm applied field is 21.5%. Compared with pure ST thin film, the polarization-electric field loops of ST/BT heterostructure display high polarization and good symmetry, which could be attributed to the introduction of BT with high dielectric constant and inhibition of the potential pitfalls movement for high barrier at ST/BT interface. Moreover, the heterostructure demonstrates photoconductivity behavior with 405 nm light illumination. The results indicate that ST/BT heterostructure is a potential material in application as multifunctional photoelectric devices.","Diao, Chunli;Liu, Hanxing;Hao, Hua;Cao, Minghe;Yao, Zhonghua;Zheng, Haiwu",2018-08-01,Ceramics International,"SrTiO3/BaTiO3 heterostructure,Dielectrical properties,Photoconductivity,Ferroelectric materials",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.265,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.265
Tensile properties and microstructural characterization of Hi-Nicalon SiC/RBSN composites,"The room temperature physical and mechanical properties of silicon carbide fiber-reinforced reaction-bonded silicon nitride matrix composites (SiC/RBSN) were measured, and the composite microstructure was analyzed. The composites consist of nearly 24 vol% of aligned Hi-Nicalon SiC fiber yarns in a ∼30 vol% porous silicon nitride matrix. The fiber yarns were coated by chemical vapor deposition with a 0.8 μm layer of boron nitride (BN) followed by a 0.2 μm layer of SiC. In the as-fabricated condition, both 1-D and 2-D composites exhibited high strength and graceful failure, and showed improved properties when compared with unreinforced matrix of comparable density. No indication of reaction between the SiC fiber and BN coating was noticed, but the outer SiC layer reacted locally with the nitridation enhancing additive in the RBSN matrix. A comparison is made between the predicted and measured values of matrix cracking strength.","Bhatt, Ramakrishna T",2000-06-16,Ceramics International,"A. Tape casting,B. Hot pressing,B. Composites,C.

Sol-gel thin films for corrosion protection,"The preparation of sol-gel coatings with specific chemical functions offers potential advantages over traditional methods as it offers tailoring of their structure, texture and thickness and allows the fabrication of large coatings. The chemical protection of 316L stainless steel has been verified for ZrO2, TiO2SiO2 and Al2O3SiO2 coatings. The anticorrosion behavior of the films have been characterized in acidic and basic media by weight and loss, electrochemical techniques, XRD and FTIR and SEM spectroscopic techniques. Analysis of the data indicates that the films act as geometric blocking layers against exposure to the corrosive media and increase drastically the lifetime of the substrate (for instance up to 10 for stainless steel).","Atik, Mohamed;de Lima Neto, Pedro;Avaca, Luiz A.;Aegerter, Michel A.",1995-12-31,Ceramics International, ,10.1016/0272-8842(95)94466-N,https://doi.org/10.1016/0272-8842(95)94466-N
Tribological behavior of cobalt/graphene composite coatings,"Pure cobalt and cobalt/graphene composite coatings were fabricated on St37 steel substrates by using the electrodeposition method. The morphology and microhardness of the coatings were investigated. The tribological behavior of the specimens was evaluated under the normal loads of 5, 10, and 15 N and through the sliding distances of 300, 600, and 900 m at the ambient temperature. SEM images revealed that the graphene particles had been appropriately distributed within the cobalt matrix. Both the cobalt and cobalt/graphene composite coatings had a nodular-pyramidal morphology. However, the morphology of composite coating was finer than that of the pure cobalt film. According to the wear results, both the cobalt and composite coatings exhibited a much better wear behavior compared to the steel substrate. The co-deposition of graphene particles decreased the volume loss and friction coefficient of pure cobalt film. The volume loss increased by the increment of the applied load and sliding distance. However, increasing the normal load decreased the average coefficient of friction in all the samples. The main wear mechanism of all the samples was abrasion, except for the substrate at the high normal loads.","Toosinezhad, Amirhosein;Alinezhadfar, Mohammad;Mahdavi, Soheil",2020-07-31,Ceramics International,"Films,Nanocomposites,Wear resistance,Carbon",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.267,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.267
Effect of different heat treatments on oxidation-bonded SiC membrane for water filtration,"The porous SiC-based membrane has proved its validity in microfiltration membrane fabrication, but application is limited due to its high fabrication cost. In this study, the oxidation-bonding technique was used to fabricate a SiC microfiltration membrane. The oxidation behaviour exhibited during different thermal treatments was related to pore morphology, and ultimately membrane permeance. Corrosion properties of the oxidation-bonded SiC specimens were also studied. We have found that a membrane made by coating an oxidation-bonded SiC layer over a clay-bonded SiC support and sintered at 1000 °C for 3 h could make a defect-free, corrosion resistant microfiltration membrane with pure water membrane permeance above 700 LMH per bar over the 1 h operation time.

Influence of Y2O3 on the microstructure and tribological properties of Ti-based wear-resistant laser-clad layers on TC4 alloy,"Multi-track Ti-based wear-resistant composite coatings were fabricated on TC4 alloy surfaces using laser-clad TC4 + Ni45 + Co–WC mixed powders with different Y2O3 contents (0, 1, and 3 wt%). The microstructure, microhardness, and tribological properties of the coatings were characterised using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometry, electron probe X-ray micro analyser, microhardness tester, and friction and wear testing apparatus. The results showed that the number of cracks on the coating surfaces gradually decreased with the addition of Y2O3 and that residual Co–WC powders existed in the coating subsurfaces. The phase composition of the coatings with different Y2O3 contents remained unchanged and was mainly composed of reinforcing phases of TiC, TiB2, Ti2Ni, and matrix α-Ti. With the addition of Y2O3, the coating microstructure was remarkably refined, the direction characteristic of the TiC dendrites obviously weakened, and the nucleation rate significantly increased. When the added Y2O3 was 3 wt%, a large amount of TiB2–TiC-dependent growth composite phases precipitated in the coating. The two-dimensional lattice misfit between (0001)TiB2 and (111)TiC was 0.912%, which indicated that TiB2 and TiC formed a coherent interface. When the amount of Y2O3 was increased, the microhardness of the coatings gradually decreased, and the wear volume of the coatings first increased and then decreased. Under the effect of the TiB2–TiC composite phases, the wear resistance of the 3 wt% Y2O3 coating was optimal. The 3 wt% Y2O3 coating friction coefficient was the lowest, and the wear mechanism was abrasive wear.","Zhang, T.G.;Zhuang, H.F.;Zhang, Q.;Yao, B.;Yang, F.",2020-06-15,Ceramics International,"Y2O3,Laser cladding,Microstructure,TiB2–TiC,Two-dimensional lattice misfit,Tribological properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.159,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.159

Vertical and horizontal cracks appeared in the microstructural analysis of the coatings. Coating prepared under spray conditions having 40 mm distance between the spray gun and the sample exhibit high hardness, both at 0 h and 10 h heat treatment holding time.

High temperature microwave absorbing properties of plasma sprayed La0.6Sr0.4FeO3-δ/MgAl2O4 composite ceramic coatings,"Microwave absorbing materials (MAM) which can be used in high temperature and oxidation environments are strongly demanded in application, for conventional MAM fail due to various factors at high temperature. In this work, ceramic coatings composed of La0.6Sr0.4FeO3-δ and MgAl2O4 have been successfully prepared via atmospheric plasma spraying and the microwave absorbing properties at high temperature are first reported. When the coatings of LSF/MAS matched with the metal substrate on thermal expansion, they can be treated repeatedly in the temperature range of 300 K–1173 K without peeling off. Meantime, the ceramic coatings with thickness of 1.5 mm showed considerable microwave absorption in the range of 8 GHz–18 GHz at high temperatures between 673 K–1173 K. The absorption bandwidth of LSF30 was 3.5 GHz for RL < −10 dB and 8 GHz for RL < −5 dB in the temperature range of 673 K–1173 K.

Correlation of the fatigue impact resistance of bilayer and nanolayered PVD coatings with their cutting performance in machining Ti6Al4V,"Titanium alloys are widely employed in aerospace and biomedical applications. During the cutting process of Ti6Al4V alloy, the material characteristics of high specific strength and poor thermal conductivity lead to a stress concentration occurred at the tool/chip interface, which may cause severe failure of the coated tools. Besides, the titanium alloy gives rise to serrated chips, whose thickness varies regularly in the cycle mode, which lead to the variation of cutting force and tool stress. So a cyclic impact with high frequency is applied on the coated tool surface, and this induces the fatigue fracture of coating. In this study, repetitive contact between the coating and Vickers diamond indenter through the high frequency cyclic impact tester was developed by employing the ultrasonic actuator device. High frequency cyclic impact testing has been used to study the impact resistance of the TiSiN/TiAlN bilayer coating and TiSiN/TiAlN nanolayered coating. Besides, stress concentration resulting in the failure of coatings can be generated by using the sharp Vickers indenter. The crack propagation in coatings was investigated by the scanning electron microscope (SEM), and the fracture processes of coatings were studied from the force measurement data acquisition system. In addition, the cutting performance of cemented carbide tools coated with these two coatings was evaluated in turning Ti6Al4V titanium alloy. The correlation between the fatigue impact resistance of coatings at high frequency and the wear behavior of coated tools under different cutting conditions was studied. It can be concluded that the TiSiN/TiAlN nanolayered coating showed better properties to resist fatigue impact at the lower impact load, but worse properties to resist fatigue impact at the higher impact load.","Zha, Xuming;Chen, Fengbiao;Jiang, Feng;Xu, Xipeng",2019-08-15,Ceramics International,"Coated tool,Impact resistance,High frequency,Cutting performance,Crack propagation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.193,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.193
TiO2–ZnO/Ni–5wt.%Al composite coatings on GH4169 superalloys by atmospheric plasma spray techniques and theirs elevated-temperature tribological behavior,"Ni–based composite coatings with different amounts of TiO2–ZnO were fabricated by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) to protect GH4169 superalloy substrates against excess wear and friction at elevated temperatures. In addition, the influence of the simultaneous addition of the oxides on the microstructure, microhardness, and wear behaviour was investigated. According to the results, the simultaneous addition of TiO2/ZnO provides anti-friction and wear inhibition over 600 °C. In particular at 800 °C, the TiO2–ZnO/Ni–5wt.%Al composite coating (10 wt% TiO2 and 10 wt% ZnO were incorporated within Ni–5wt.%Al matrix) exhibits a superior lubricity and wear resistance compared to the Ni–5wt.%Al based coatings. The XRD, Raman, and TEM characterisations reveal the formation of a glaze oxide layer consisting of NiO, TiO2, ZnO and the in-situ production of ternary oxide (Zn2TiO4), which was primarily responsible for the tribological performance of the sliding wear contacts at the specific temperature.","Shi, Peiying;Wan, Shanhong;Yi, Gewen;Sun, Huwei;Yu, Yuan;Xie, Erqing;Wang, Qihua;Shen, Shirley Z.;Alam, Nazmul",2020-06-15,Ceramics International,"Ni based composite coating,Titanium dioxide,Zinc oxide,Atmospheric plasma spray,High temperature tribology",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.138,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.138

The eutectic microstructure of the coating shows the characteristic of nano structure, in which Cr particles with size less than 40nm distribute in (Al,Cr)2O3 solid solution matrix. The hypoeutectic microstructure of the coating consists of Cr particles with size larger than 1µm and [(Al,Cr)2O3+Cr] divorced eutectic.

Optical and photocatalytic properties of Fe3+-doped TiO2 thin films prepared by a sol–gel spin coating,"Various iron ion (Fe3+) doped titanium dioxide (TiO2) thin films (Fe3+-doped TiO2) have been successfully prepared on a glass substrate by a sol–gel spin coating route using titanium tetraisopropoxide and iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate as the initial materials. After the Fe3+-doped TiO2 thin films were calcined at 823K for 1h, the effect of Fe3+-doping on the optical properties and photocatalytic activity were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), ultraviolet– visible spectroscopy, spectroscopic ellipsometry and photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue. The XRD results showed that all Fe3+-doped TiO2 thin films contained only a single crystalline phase of anatase TiO2 after calcining at 823K for 1h. Moreover, the XRD results also revealed that the crystallinity and crystalline size decreased with increased Fe3+-doping due to worsening of the crystallization of anatase TiO2. FESEM micrographs showed that all Fe3+-doped TiO2 thin films have smooth surfaces containing granular nanocrystallines and are without cracks. The UV–vis absorption spectra showed that the absorption of the TiO2 thin films had a small red-shift as the Fe3+-doping increased. The direct band gap energy ( E g d ) and indirect band gap energy ( E g i n d ) of Fe3+-doped TiO2 films decreased with increasing Fe3+-doping.

Effect of polyethylene glycol on the electrophoretic deposition of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles in isopropanol,"The suspensions of hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles were prepared in isopropanol and polyethylene glycol (PEG) was used as a dispersant. The suspensions were characterized by various tests such as electrical conductivity, zeta potential, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and particle size distribution. The results showed that PEG is protonated and then adsorbed on the surface of HA nanoparticles enhancing their stability by an electrosteric stabilization mechanism. Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) was performed at different voltages (60 and 200V) and times (15, 30, 60, 120, 240 and 360s). EPD from the suspension with 2g/L PEG showed the fastest kinetic due to the highest zeta potential (+32.9mV) of HA nanoparticles in it. The wet density of deposits increased with deposition time and voltage due to the particles rearrangement within it during EPD under the influence of electro-osmotic flow. The SEM images showed that the deposit formed from the suspension with 2g/L PEG had a finer microstructure with less agglomeration. Optical microscope images showed that PEG acted as an effective binder to prevent from deposit cracking during drying. The coating deposited from the suspension with 2g/L PEG had the best corrosion resistance in Ringer's solution at 37.5°C.","Kuche Loghmani, Saeede;Farrokhi-Rad, Morteza;Shahrabi, Taghi",2013-08-31,Ceramics International,"C.

"Atomic structure and residual stress of carbon-doped TiMeN (Me = Zr, Al, and Cr) coatings on mechanical properties","The hardnesses of carbon-doped TiMeN (Me = Zr, Al, and Cr) coatings were investigated in terms of lattice distortion and residual stress according to the difference in the ionic radii of the transition metal. TiMeN coatings were deposited on SUS304 by sputtering, and laser carburization was carried out for carbon doping. The scratch test showed that the delaminations of TiZrN, TiAlN, and TiCrN coatings were occurred about 13 N, 19 N, and, 16 N before and after carbon doping. The rate of hardness increase rate of TiZrN with carbon doping was the highest at 15.1%, and that of TiAlN and TiCrN were at 8.8% and 10.7%, respectively. The difference in hardness was analyzed by Rietveld refinement using HR-XRD, and the change in the lattice constant for TiZrN was 0.18 Å, which was larger than that of TiAlN (0.10 Å) and TiCrN (0.07 Å). The expansion distortion was confirmed by the increase in lattice constant, and the doped carbon affected the lattice distortion differently depending on the ionic radius of the transition metal. The variation in residual stress through the lattice distortion was identified by the sin2Ψ method using HR-XRD with parallel beam and tilting of the specimen. The TiZrN coating showed the largest residual stress variation at 22%, and TiAlN and TiCrN showed similar tendencies at 11% and 13%, respectively.","Hong, Eunpyo;Kim, Taewoo;Lee, Seon-Hong;Lee, Jung Woo;Lee, Heesoo",2019-05-31,Ceramics International,"Titanium metal nitride,Carbon doping,Hardness,Lattice distortion,Residual stress,HR-XRD",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.263,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.263
Formation of vertical cracks in air plasma sprayed YSZ coatings using unpyrolyzed powder,"Thick thermal barrier coatings (TTBCs) with vertical cracks deposited by air plasma spray (APS) and solution precursor plasma spray (SPPS) techniques have been widely investigated to achieve good thermal insulation along with reasonable service life. In this study, synthesized unpyrolyzed YSZ powder was air plasma sprayed in order to produce segmentation crack TTBCs. The microstructure and hardness of the deposits were then compared with those of the conventional TTBCs and dense vertically cracked (DVC)TTBCs. In this regard, spraying parameters were optimized to achieve deposits with the appropriate amount of unpyrolyzed particles in them to assist inducing vertical cracks in the deposited layers. The effect of the unpyrolyzed particles on microstructure, porosity, and microhardness of plasma sprayed coatings were also evaluated and compared. The new fabricated coating showed a bimodal structure combining non-molten sub-micron size particles and conventional splats along with segmentation cracks with higher amount of porosity and lower hardness compared to those of the DVC coatings. The results implied that, depositing unpyrolyzed powder by APS, as a new approach for achieving segmentation crack TTBCs, is very promising.","Izadinia, Mohammad;Soltani, Reza;Sohi, Mahmoud Heydarzadeh",2020-10-01,Ceramics International,"Thick thermal barrier coatings,Air plasma spray,Unpyrolyzed YSZ powder,Segmentation cracks",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.320,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.320
Influence of phase composition on thermal aging behavior of plasma sprayed ytterbium silicate coatings,"In this study, ytterbium silicate coatings with different phase compositions were designed by controlling Yb2O3/SiO2 ratio and fabricated by atmospheric plasma spray (APS) technique. Thermal aging behaviors such as microstructure evolution and thermomechanical properties were focused, and the influence of phase composition was analyzed. Results showed that obvious grain growth and defect reduction occurred, and the thermomechanical properties were significantly modified after thermal aging. The larger reduction in defects and greater increase in elastic modulus, Vickers hardness and coefficient of thermal expansion took place in the Yb2O3-rich coatings containing Yb2O3 and Yb2SiO5 phases. The bigger grains and transgranular cracks were formed and the greater increase in thermal conductivity took place in the SiO2-rich coatings containing Yb2SiO5 and Yb2Si2O7 phases. The relationship among microstructure evolution and variation of thermomechanical properties was analyzed. The results of this study may provide a reference for design and application of rare-earth silicates as environmental barrier coatings (EBCs).","Zhu, Tao;Niu, Yaran;Zhong, Xin;Zhao, Jun;Li, Qilian;Zeng, Yi;Zheng, Xuebin",2018-10-01,Ceramics International,"Ytterbium silicates,Atmospheric plasma spray,Thermal aging,Phase composition,Thermomechanical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.200,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.06.200
In-situ formation of Fe3O4 and ZrO2 coated Fe-based soft magnetic composites by hydrothermal method,"In this paper, the soft magnetic composite was prepared using a powder metallurgy method with the Fe3O4 and ZrO2 co-coated iron powder which was synthesized though the in-situ hydrothermal method. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) coupled with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that the Fe3O4 and ZrO2 were uniformly coated on the surface of iron powders. The addition of ZrO2 in the coating effectively improves the properties of the soft magnetic composite. ZrO2 can further improve the insulating properties, and enhance the thermostability of the coating simultaneously which will lead to resistivity increase and eddy current loss decrease. By controlling the additive amount of zirconium cation and annealing temperature, high magnetic induction of 1.002 T (measured at 8000 A/m), relatively high permeability of 83 (measured at 100 kHz), and low total core loss of 255.2 W/kg (measured at 100 kHz and 50 mT) were achieved. The Fe@ZrO2&Fe3O4 SMCs show high electrical resistivity and saturation induction, which may be widely used in high speed electric motor, transformer, inductance and switching power supply.","Li, Wangchang;Wang, Zhaojia;Ying, Yao;Yu, Jing;Zheng, Jingwu;Qiao, Liang;Che, Shenglei",2019-02-15,Ceramics International,"ZrO2,In-situ surface oxidation,Hydrothermal method,SMCs",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.058,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.11.058
The effects of phenolic resin-derived PyC interlayers on microstructure and mechanical properties of Cf/SiC composites,"A novel, easy and cost-effective way, infiltration and pyrolysis of phenolic resin solution, was exploited to prepare pyrolytic carbon (PyC) interlayers for carbon fiber/silicon carbide (Cf/SiC) mini-composites. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, dynamic contact angle measurement and scanning electron microscope were carried out to characterize chemical structure of carbon fibers (CFs), wetting properties between CFs and phenolic resin solution and microstructure of CFs and their composites, respectively. Remarkably, SEM results showed regulation of uniformity and thicknesses of PyC interlayer could be achieved through controlling the concentration of phenolic resin solution and oxidation condition of CFs. When CFs were treated by 10 min' oxidation with 40 mg/L ozone followed by dip-coating with 4 wt% phenolic solution, uniform PyC interlayer with approximately 120 nm were prepared on CFs. The corresponding Cf/SiC specimens had the largest increase in tensile strength and work of fracture with the improvement of 26.2% and 71.6% from the PyC-free case.","Wang, Jie;Pei, Xueliang;Zhi, Jianhai;Huang, Jing;Mo, Gaoming;Wang, Yanfei;Zhen, Xiali;He, Liu;Huang, Qing",2018-10-01,Ceramics International,"B.

Preparation of agglomerated powders for air plasma spraying MoSi2 coating,"The agglomerated MoSi2 powders, ideal for air plasma spraying, were prepared by spray drying and subsequent vacuum sintering of ultrafine MoSi2 powders. The apparent density and flowability were measured by an apparent density instrument and a hall flowmeter. The structure of as-prepared powders and coatings was analyzed by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The results indicated that resultant powders were spherical and porous. It was found that heat treatment had decreased the sphericity as well as the porosity of the MoSi2 particles. The agglomerated powders, sintered at 1300°C for 1h, showed 57.0% and 46% more flowability and apparent density, respectively, compared to that of the spray dried powders. The as-sintered MoSi2 powders subjected to the plasma flame exhibited a further increase in the density. The as-sprayed coating by using the agglomerated powders with a size of 30–54μm yielded a network structural MoSi2 composite coating with MoSi2 as the major phase.","Yan, Jian-hui;Jian-jian Xu,;Rafi-ud-din,;Wang, Yi;Liu, Long-Fei",2015-11-30,Ceramics International,"MoSi2 powders,Spray drying,Heat treatment,Air plasma spray,Coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.04.149,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.04.149
Deposition of ceramic nanocomposite coatings by electroplating process: A review of layer-deposition mechanisms and effective parameters on the formation of the coating,"Nowadays, the demand for the metal matrix composites for various applications such as aerospace and defense industries, chemical industries and fluid transfer facilities and so on has increased in order to cope with severe environmental conditions and service stresses. Electroplating technique is one of the suitable methods that has been considered by researchers in the past decade due to its simplicity, low cost and low temperature of the process, easy access to the nanoscale structure as well as the production of high-density and porosity-free coatings. Electroplating is a low temperature process that is used as an economical method to develop nanocomposite coatings in one step without secondary operation. In the process of electroplating, various factors including bath parameters such as pH, concentration of different additives, concentration of different lubricants, temperature as well as process parameters such as current density, frequency of applied current and stirring speed of the bath on morphology, roughness, co-precipitation of nanoparticles and microhardness of coatings, as well as wear and corrosion behavior of nanocomposite coatings in direct and pulsed current conditions are of great importance. Therefore, in this research, the mechanisms and factors affecting the formation of the film and coating by electroplating process have been studied.","Mersagh Dezfuli, Saeid;Sabzi, Masoud",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Electroplating process,Deposition,Effective parameters on co-precipitation,Ceramic nanocomposite coatings,Layer-deposition mechanisms",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.190,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.190
Effect of pre-oxidation on the ablation resistance of ZrB2–SiC coating for SiC-coated carbon/carbon composites,"To improve ablation resistance of carbon/carbon (C/C) composites at high temperature, ZrB2–SiC coating was prepared on surface of SiC-coated C/C composites by supersonic atmosphere plasma spray. The coated C/C composites were pre-oxidized in air at 1373K. In the present work, the influence of pre-oxidation treatment on the microstructure and ablation resistance of ZrB2–SiC coating was investigated. Ablation resistance of coated C/C composites was tested in oxyacetylene torch environment with the heat flux of 2400kW/m2. Results show that the liquid glass phase seals defects in the as-sprayed coating after pre-oxidation for 15min and a dense coating is obtained. The pre-oxidation coating can protect C/C composites for 90s, which is due to the formation of a dense oxides layer and the molten ZrO2 layer.","Zhang, YuLei;Hu, Zhixiong;Yang, Boxing;Ren, Jincui;Li, Hejun",2015-03-31,Ceramics International,"Carbon/carbon composites,Coating,Supersonic atmosphere plasma spraying,Pre-oxidation,Ablation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.11.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.11.006
Preparation of Ni–W–Si3N4 composite coatings and evaluation of their scratch resistance properties,"In this study, Ni–W–Si3N4 nanocomposite coatings have been prepared by codeposition of Si3N4 nanoparticles into Ni–W alloy coatings having different W contents. The surface morphology and elemental contents in the alloy composite coatings have been analyzed by scanning electron microscopy coupled with EDS. Structure and phase composition were evaluated by using X-ray diffraction (XRD). Progressive type of scratch test was carried out by the scratch tester using a diamond indenter. Results indicated that Vickers microhardness of the Ni–W–Si3N4 composite coatings is found to be higher in comparison to the corresponding Ni–W coatings. In addition, a small increase in Vickers microhardness was observed in Ni–W coatings with higher content of tungsten. Apart from that, a significant influence had been found on scratch resistance properties with the codeposition of Si3N4 and variation of W contents in Ni–W–Si3N4 nanocomposite coatings.

Critical role of C/SiO2 composite coating in enhancing the mechanical and antioxidation properties of 3D needled carbon fibers,"Herein, a hydrothermal carbonization coating/SiO2 (HTCC/SiO2) composite coating on 3D needled carbon fibers (Cf/HTCC-SiO2) was successfully designed and constructed through a combined hydrothermal carbonization and sol-gel process for the first time. The results revealed that the microstructure and morphology of HTCC and SiO2 coatings strongly depended on the key process parameters in the synthetic process. The optimal conditions for fabrication of Cf/HTCC-SiO2 were achieved as following: the hydrothermal temperature was 180 °C and holding time was 2 h; the TEOS mass fraction was 30 wt%, the distilled water/ethanol molar ratio was 6:1 and sol-gel time was 2 h, respectively. The relatively continuous and uniform HTCC/SiO2 composite coating with a single thickness about 350 and 300 nm effectively improved the mechanical and anti-oxidation of 3D needled Cf. Compared with the uncoated 3D needled Cf, the compressive strength was increased about 336% and the rapid oxidation temperature was improved about 100 °C after the incorporation of HTCC/SiO2 composite coating.","Chen, Jingmao;Qian, Hong;Dong, Shun;Hong, Changqing;Zhang, Xinghong",2020-09-15,Ceramics International,"Carbon fiber,Carbon,SiO2,Coating,Mechanical,Anti-oxidation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.128,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.128

"Reversible, repeatable and low phase transition behaviour of spin coated nanostructured vanadium oxide thin films with superior mechanical properties","Smooth, uniform and crystalline vanadium oxide thin films were deposited on quartz by spin coating technique with four different rpm i.e., 1000, 2000, 3000 and 4000 and subsequently post annealed at 350, 450 and 550 °C in vacuum. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques were utilized for microstructural characterizations and phase analysis, respectively, for vanadium oxide powder and deposited film. Nanorods were observed to be grown after vacuum annealing. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technique was utilized to study the elemental oxidation state of deposited vanadium oxide films. Thermo-optical and electrical properties such as solar transmittance (τs), reflectance (ρs), absorptance (αs), infrared (IR) emittance (εir) and sheet resistance (Rs) of different thin films were evaluated. Based on the optical characteristics the optimized condition of the film processing was identified to be spin coated at 3000 rpm. Subsequently, the nanoindentation technique was utilized to measure hardness and Young's modulus of the optimized film. The measured nanomechanical properties were found to be superior to those reported for sputtered vanadium oxide films. Finally, temperature dependent phase transition characteristics of optimized vanadium oxide films were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique. Reversible and repeatable phase transition was found to occur in the range of 44–48 °C which was significantly lower than the phase transition temperature (i.e., 68 °C) of bulk VO2.","Mukherjee, Dipta;Dey, Arjun;Esther, A.

Effects of heat treatment on microstructure and mechanical properties of TiC/TiB composite bioinert ceramic coatings in-situ synthesized by laser cladding on Ti6Al4V,"To improve the wear resistance of titanium alloy, in this work, TiC/TiB composite bioinert ceramic coatings were synthesized in-situ via laser cladding using Ti and B4C mixed powders as precursor materials. And to decrease the impact of the excessive residual tensile stress generated by the uneven temperature distribution on the performance of coatings, the coatings were then subsequently heated for 3 h at different temperatures (400 °C, 600 °C, and 800 °C) and then air cooled. The effects of heat treatment on the microstructure, residual stress, micro-hardness, fracture toughness, and wear resistance of the coatings were investigated. The results showed that phase compositions and microstructure of the heat-treated coatings were virtually identical to that of the untreated coatings; however, the precipitation of acicular TiB enhanced mechanical properties of the heat-treated coatings. In addition, the average residual tensile stress values of the coatings decreased as the heat treatment temperature increased, which improved fracture toughness of the coatings from 3.95 to 4.68 MPa m1/2. Moreover, wear resistance of the coatings was greatly enhanced by heat treatment; as the wear volume of the heat-treated coatings decreased by 50% at 800 °C compared with that of the untreated coatings. Lastly, the coatings showed good biocompatibility after being evaluated in vitro, and therefore had broad application prospects in the field of orthopedic implants.","Chen, Tao;Li, Wenpeng;Liu, Defu;Xiong, Yi;Zhu, Xiangcheng",2020-08-21,Ceramics International,"TiC/TiB bioinert Ceramic coatings,Heat treatment,Laser cladding,Mechanical properties,Biocompatibility",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.186,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.186
Fabrication of oxide-based near infrared-shielding coatings for a smart window to prevent infrared-induced photoaging in human skin,"Oxide-based near infrared (IR)-shielding coatings consisting of quarter‐wave stacks of oxygen-deficient tantalum oxide (Ta2O5−x) and silicon oxide (SiO2) multilayers and tin-doped indium oxide (In2O3) (ITO) films with the thicknesses of 200–600 nm can block the passage of IR-A (wavelength: 760–1400 nm) and IR-B (wavelength: 1400–3000 nm) radiation, respectively. In this study, the optical properties and microstructure of these oxide-based IR-shielding coatings were investigated. Transmission electron microscopy images indicated that amorphous Ta2O5−x/amorphous SiO2 multilayers were uniform and dense. ITO films were found to be highly crystalline and show carrier concentrations of up to 7.1 × 1020 cm−3, resulting in the strong IR-B optical absorption due to the plasma excitation of the free carriers. Oxide-based IR-shielding coatings with an ITO thickness of 420 nm were found to have near-IR shielding rates of >90% and an average visible light transmittance of >70%. The effects of IR on human keratinocytes were studied to evaluate the IR-induced photoaging in human skin. It was found that the downregulation of cellular proliferation and the enhancement of senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity induced by IR irradiation were significantly inhibited by oxide-based IR-shielding coatings.

Evolution of microstructure and anti-oxidation ability of ZrB2 improved by a unique inert glass phase,"Zirconium Boride is widely used as thermal protection materials. However, the characteristics of poor oxidation resistance of ZrB2 at high temperatures limits its applications. In order to improve the anti-oxidation performance of ZrB2, a novel method of doping LaF3 is adopted in present study. In the synthesis process of ZrB2 via carbothermal reduction method, LaF3 was introduced to the initial materials. Motivated by the slightly higher formation temperature of ZrB2 than the melting point of LaF3, a liquid glass phase composed of F and La was deposited on the surface of ZrB2, which naturally brought in oxygen starvation and contributed to improved oxidation resistance performance. The crystal lattice parameters and the anti-oxidation ability of ZrB2 are closely dependent on the added LaF3 content, which can ascribe to La3+/Zr2+ substitution and the amount of glass phase on the surface of ZrB2.","Zhang, Sheng-Hui;Min Zhang,;Jing Hu,;Zhang, Zhong-Wei;Hao, Van Bui;Li Zhang,;Wang, Xin;Jian, Xian;Deng, Long-Jiang;Yin, Liang-Jun",2019-08-01,Ceramics International,"ZrB2,Carbothermal reduction,Coating,LaF3,Oxidation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.139,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.139
Thermal shock behavior of 8YSZ and double-ceramic-layer La2Zr2O7/8YSZ thermal barrier coatings fabricated by atmospheric plasma spraying,"The single-ceramic-layer (SCL) 8YSZ (conventional and nanostructured 8YSZ) and double-ceramic-layer (DCL) La2Zr2O7 (LZ)/8YSZ thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) were fabricated by plasma spraying on nickel-based superalloy substrates with NiCrAlY as the bond coat. The thermal shock behavior of the three as-sprayed TBCs at 1000°C and 1200°C was investigated. The results indicate that the thermal cycling lifetime of LZ/8YSZ TBCs is longer than that of SCL 8YSZ TBCs due to the fact that the DCL LZ/8YSZ TBCs further enhance the thermal insulation effect, improve the sintering resistance ability and relieve the thermal mismatch between the ceramic layer and the metallic layer at high temperature. The nanostructured 8YSZ has higher thermal shock resistance ability than that of the conventional 8YSZ TBC which is attributed to the lower tensile stress in plane and higher fracture toughness of the nanostructured 8YSZ layer. The pre-existed cracks in the surface propagate toward the interface vertically under the thermal activation. The nucleation and growth of the horizontal crack along the interface eventually lead to the failure of the coating. The crack propagation modes have been established, and the failure patterns of the three as-sprayed coatings during thermal shock have been discussed in detail.","Wang, L.;Wang, Y.;Sun, X.G.;He, J.Q.;Pan, Z.Y.;Wang, C.H.",2012-07-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Evaluation of bioglass and hydroxyapatite based nanocomposite coatings obtained by electrophoretic deposition,"Different compositions of bioglass and hydroxyapatite composite coatings were fabricated by electrophoretic deposition on titanium substrate and their various properties were investigated. Stability and characteristics of the prepared suspensions using isopropanol and triethanolamine (TEA) were also studied by zeta potential, FTIR and conductivity measurements. Results showed that optimum amount of TEA to make stable suspension is influenced by particle size and consequently this affects suspension conductivity and deposition kinetics either. Moreover porosity of the coatings microstructure was affected by the particles size, as the incorporation of finer HA particles among coarser BG particles leaded to more compact coatings. Obtained data contended that bioglass (BG) coating includes 50%wt hydroxyapatite (HA) had the highest bioactivity response within 1 day immersion in SBF solution, as well as the maximum bonding strength.

Spray-drying assisted synthesis of a Li4Ti5O12/C composite for high rate performance lithium ion batteries,"Spinel crystalline lithium titanium oxide (Li4Ti5O12 or LTO) has gained attention as a possible alternative material to graphite for use as anodes in lithium-ion rechargeable batteries due to its low volume expansion and dendrite-free long-term stability. However, the rate capability of LTO is limited by its low electronic conductivity, which results in a large polarization resistance between electrodes. In this study, we demonstrate a spray-drying-assisted carbon coating approach to synthesize LTO/C composites for enhanced lithium-insertion capacity and facilitated charge-discharge reaction kinetics. The thin carbon layer of LTO/C composite contributes to suppressing particle growth by forming passivating carbon layers. In addition to the decrease in particle size for short lithium-diffusion pathways, the highly conductive carbon layers reduce the interfacial resistance between the electrode and electrolyte by enhanced electrical conductivity. The electrochemical performances of the spray-drying-prepared LTO/C composite such as the specific capacity, cycle and rate capabilities, and impedance are compared with pristine LTO and carbon-coated LTO synthesized without spray-drying. The LTO/C prepared from glucose exhibits a 11.15% enhancement in rate characteristics of pristine LTO at 0.5C after 100 cycles. These results indicate that the carbon coating layer promotes charge transfer and ion diffusion as well as provides a buffering effect for improved rate and cyclic capabilities.","Park, Ji-Hyun;Kang, Seok-Won;Kwon, Tae-Soon;Park, Ho Seok",2018-02-15,Ceramics International,"Carbon layer,Glucose,High rate performance,Lithium titanium oxide (LTO),Spray-drying",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.217,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.217
Effects of laser remelting on microstructure and solid particle erosion characteristics of ZrO2–7wt%Y2O3 thermal barrier coating prepared by plasma spraying,"In this study, the influences of laser remelting on microstructural characteristics, microhardness, and solid particle erosion behavior of MCrAlY/ZrO2–7wt%Y2O3 double-layer structure thermal barrier coatings prepared by plasma spraying were examined. The erosion failure mechanisms of the as-sprayed and laser-remelted coatings were investigated. Results show that the plasma-sprayed coating has a typical lamellar stacking characteristic with high porosity. The surface lamellar defect of the as-sprayed coating was erased, and the compactness of the coating improved significantly after laser remelting. The laser-remelted coating consisted of a remelted layer with a dense column-like crystal structure, a heat-affected layer with a more dense structure than that of the as-sprayed coating, and a remaining plasma-sprayed layer. The microhardness and erosion resistance of the laser-remelted coating are considerably better than the as-sprayed one. The spalling of the sprayed splats from the lamellar interface and crushing of brittle ceramic coating are mainly attributed to the erosion failure of the plasma-sprayed coating. By contrast, cracks occurred in the region near the surface of the laser-remelted layer, and the erosion occurred mainly because of the removal of these small blocks. The laser-remelted coating has evident micro-cutting marks and some ductile erosion characteristics.","Wang, Dongsheng;Tian, Zongjun;Shen, Lida;Liu, Zhidong;Huang, Yinhui",2014-07-31,Ceramics International,"Microsturcture-final,Wear resistance,ZrO2,Y2O3",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.01.101,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.01.101
Lateral growth of coating on Co2Z ferrite during electroplating of multilayer chip inductors,"Lateral growth of nickel coating on a ferrite substrate during electroplating of multilayer chip inductors (MLCI) was investigated. It was found that the lateral growth occurred after a certain time of electroplating, but not at the initial stage. Resistivity of the ferrite and inductance of MLCI decreased continuously with electroplating time. Moreover, surface morphology of the ferrite changed significantly after electroplating, which indicated chemical reactions to take place during the plating process whereas corrosion effect of acid solution on the material can be neglected. Judging from the results obtained, it was inferred that the resistance degradation should be attributed to hydrogen reduction during electroplating, which consequently led to the lateral growth of on the ferrite.","Cao, Jiang Li;Wang, Xiao Hui;Zhang, Li;Liu, Min;Li, Long Tu",2003-12-31,Ceramics International,"B.

Tribological and electrochemical corrosion behavior of Ni–W/BN (hexagonal) nano-composite coatings,"Ni–W/BN (hexagonal) nanocomposite coatings were successfully electrodeposited on mild steel by direct current (DC) and pulse current (PC) methods. Electrodeposition was carried out by dispersing 2–8g/l of BN (h) nanopowder into the nickel sulfate electrolytic bath. The coatings were characterized by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy dispersive analysis of X-Ray (EDAX), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), and Vicker׳s microhardness tester. Tafel polarization and electrochemical impedance methods were applied to measure the corrosion resistance properties of the nanocomposite coatings in 3.5% NaCl solution. Surface roughness and friction coefficient of the coated samples were assessed by Mitutoyo Surftest SJ-310 (ISO1997), and Scratch tester TR-101-M4. The tribological characteristics and corrosion resistance properties of the nanocomposite coatings were increased with the content of the BN (h) in the plating bath. Co-deposited BN (h) nano-particulates were uniformly distributed in the Ni–W alloy matrix. The Pulse current nanocomposite coatings have offered uniform surface, higher microhardness and excellent corrosion resistance properties than the DC composite coatings.","Sangeetha, S.;Kalaignan, G.

Microstructure and thermal cycling behavior of plasma-sprayed LaMgAl11O19 coatings,"In this study, LaMgAl11O19 (LMA) thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) were deposited by atmospheric plasma spraying with different spraying powers. The effects of spraying power on the amorphous phase content, microstructure and porosity of the coatings were investigated using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The thermal expansion behavior, microhardness and bonding strength of the coatings were also studied. Results indicated that the amorphous phase content of the coatings increased with the spraying power increasing, while the porosity of the coatings exhibited an opposite trend. Coating with high amorphous phase content suffered large volume shrinkage and exhibited low thermal expansion coefficient (TEC). Bonding strength and microhardness of the coatings increased with the spraying power increasing from 22 to 32kW and then decreased from 32 to 42kW. Thermal cycling behavior of LMA coatings at 1100°C was also investigated. Spallation of the TBCs was mainly correlated with the formation of thermally grown oxides and mismatch of TECs between the topcoat and the substrate, which were influenced by the microstructure and the amorphous phase content of the coatings. The longest lifetimes were achieved on LMA coating deposited at 32kW, owing to its relatively low amorphous phase content and the highest bonding strength.","Sun, Junbin;Wang, Jinshuang;Zhou, Xin;Dong, Shujuan;Deng, Longhui;Jiang, Jianing;Cao, Xueqiang",2018-04-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Spraying power,Amorphous phase,Microstructure,Porosity,Thermal cycling",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.202,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.202
How bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells respond to poorly crystalline apatite coated orthopedic and dental titanium implants,"Due to the delayed and weak bone-implant integration in dental and orthopedic devices, there have been several attempts to enhance implant–bone interactions for rapid osseointegration. In this paper, the interactions of human bone marrow-derived stromal (mesenchymal) stem cells (hMSCs) with uncoated and coated titanium alloy implants with poorly crystalline apatite are studied. First the configuration and chemical composition of the apatite coatings and their deposition progress in different experimental conditions are investigated and discussed. Then, hMSCs are cultured on different substrates and cell attachment and proliferation are monitored and evaluated for different time intervals. Although the uncoated and coated substrates indicate good cell attachment, the differences in proliferation and morphology of the cells spread over the coated samples are significant. It is concluded that the coated samples improve the capability for accepting the cells in three-dimensional and slender shapes. The migration of hMSCs on both substrates are discussed. As such cell migration is directly associated to the osteoconduction, the findings confirm the hypothesis of enhancement in bone formation on the surface of biomimetically poorly crystalline apatite coated titanium implants. This in vitro study demonstrates that the coated samples are nontoxic and biocompatible enough for ongoing osteogenic studies in bone or dental defects in animal models in vivo.","Ghaffari, Maryam;Moztarzadeh, Fathollah;Sepahvandi, Azadeh;Mozafari, Masoud;Faghihi, Shahab",2013-09-30,Ceramics International,"D: Apatite,Biomimetic technique,Bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells,Orthopedic and dental titanium implants",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.03.039,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.03.039
Cavitation erosion characteristics at various flow velocities in NaCl medium of carbide-based cermet coatings prepared by HVOF spraying,"This study aims to investigate the correlation between flow velocity and cavitation erosion (CE) characteristics of high-velocity oxygen-fuel (HVOF) sprayed Cr3C2-NiCr (CN) and WC-Cr3C2-Ni (WCN) coatings in 3.5 wt% NaCl medium, except for the microstructures, mechanical properties and electrochemical behaviors. In comparison with the CN coating, the WCN coating shows higher values of elastic modulus (E), hardness (H), H/E and H 3 /E 2 as well as lower porosity, resulting in lower volume loss rate (VLR) and enhanced CE resistance in NaCl medium at each value of flow velocity. The VLR values of both coatings increase as the flow velocity increases. The change of the CE progresses in NaCl medium of the CN coating is the formation of cavitation pinholes, pits, craters and oxidation films coupled with the exfoliation of chromium carbide particles when the flow velocity is 23.4 and 33.5 m s−1 as well as the brittle fracture structure with layers delamination accompanied by the oxidation films when the flow velocity is 41.9 m s−1. In a wide flow velocity range, the formation of cavitation pinholes, pits and micro-cracks along with the oxidation films are addressed as the dominant CE mechanism in NaCl medium of the WCN coating.","Hong, Sheng;Lin, Jinran;Wu, Yuping;Wu, Jianhua;Zheng, Yuan;Zhang, Yuquan;Cheng, Jiangbo;Sun, Wei",2020-09-06,Ceramics International,"Cavitation erosion,HVOF,Flow velocity,Cermet,Coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.022
An innovative fabrication of nano-HA coatings on Ti-CaP nanocomposite layer using a combination of friction stir processing and electrophoretic deposition,"In the present study, a combination of friction stir processing and electrophoretic deposition was used to fabricate nano-hydroxyapatite coatings on the Ti-CaP nanocomposite surface layer. A constant tool rotation rate of 250rpm, travel speed of 16mm/min and plunge depth of 1.2mm with a tool tilt angle of 3° were used to incorporate nano-hydroxyapatite particles into Ti–6Al–4V substrates. Microstructure of the stir zone was analyzed using optical and scanning electron microscopy. Microhardness profile and AFM analysis of substrates were then studied. The electrophoretic deposition of nano-HA particles was carried out at constant voltage of 30V after 60s. The as-deposited nano-HA coating was characterized employing scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction. The results of adhesion test and potentiodynamic polarization measurements showed that Ti-CaP nanocomposite layer could effectively increase the bonding strength between coating and substrate as well as corrosion resistance.","Farnoush, Hamidreza;Sadeghi, Ali;Abdi Bastami, Ashkan;Moztarzadeh, Fathollah;Aghazadeh Mohandesi, Jamshid",2013-03-31,Ceramics International,"B.

"Preparation, biomimetic apatite induction and osteoblast proliferation test of TiO2-based coatings containing P with a graded structure","TiO2-based coatings containing P (T–P) were prepared on Ti6Al4V by microarc oxidation (MAO) with applied voltages of 200–400V in an electrolyte containing (NaPO3)6 and NaOH. The surfaces of the T–P coatings became rough and the thickness increased with increasing the applied voltage. Above 200V, anatase was found on the surface, and rutile was observed at 400V. With increasing the coating thickness, the O and P concentrations increase; while Ti and Al concentrations decrease. Ti, O and P elements display a uniform distribution character around the micropores on the surface of the T–P coating formed at 300V. However, the inner of the micropores exhibits a high Ti concentration and low O and P concentrations due to the graded distributions of Ti, O and P elements in the T–P coating. The apatite-forming ability of the T–P coating formed at 300V was evaluated by immersing in a simulated body fluid (SBF) for 28 and 56 days. The results indicate that biomimetic apatite was formed on the surface of the T–P coating after immersion in SBF for 56 days. And the further cell experiment indicates that the T–P coating can provide surface suitable for the MG63 cell proliferation.","Wei, Daqing;Zhou, Yu",2009-08-31,Ceramics International,"B. Surfaces,D.

Experimental fatigue lifetime of coated and uncoated aluminum alloy under isothermal and thermo-mechanical loadings,"This paper presents the fatigue lifetime of an aluminum–silicon–magnesium alloy, widely used in diesel engine cylinder heads, both with and without a thermal barrier coating (TBC) system. The coating system in this study consists of two layers including a 150μm thick metallic bond coat and a zirconium oxide top coat 350μm thick. These coating layers were applied on the substrate of A356.0 alloy by air plasma thermal spraying. The isothermal fatigue tests were conducted in low cycle fatigue (LCF) regime at various temperatures. Out-of-phase thermo-mechanical fatigue (OP-TMF) tests were also performed at different maximum temperatures and constraint factors. Experimental results demonstrate that at high temperature the coating increases the LCF lifetime of A356.0 alloy at higher strain amplitude and decreases it at lower strain amplitude. At LCF situation, thicker coating has more detrimental effect. However, the coating increases significantly the OP-TMF lifetime. To analyze the failure mechanisms, the fracture surfaces of specimens were investigated by scanning electron microscopy. The fractography of surfaces showed that the failure mechanism of TBC system in coated A356.0 alloy was separations of coating layers in the interface of the substrate and the bond coat layer. This was observed on both high temperature LCF and OP-TMF conditions.","Azadi, M.;Farrahi, G.H.;Winter, G.;Eichlseder, W.",2013-12-31,Ceramics International,"Aluminum alloy,Cylinder head,Low cycle fatigue,Thermo-mechanical fatigue,Thermal barrier coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.05.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.05.006
Preparation of silicon-modified gamma alumina coating through cathodic plasma electrolytic deposition,"The commonly used γ-alumina catalyst carrier for industrial production usually degrades as a result of the reduction of the specific surface area because of the transition to α-alumina at a high temperature. To enhance the phase stability, γ-alumina coatings were modified using silicon on a high-temperature nickel-based alloy through cathodic plasma electrolytic deposition (CPED). The effects of the silicon content and heat treatment on the morphology and phase stability of the coating were investigated. Furthermore, the deposition process of CPED was studied. The experimental results indicated that silicon was successfully introduced into γ-alumina coatings in two forms, namely the solid solution and oxidation states (silica). Deposition of doped silicon through cathodic plasma electrolysis inhibited the conversion from γ-alumina to α-alumina. The doped silicon content influenced the structure of the coated pores.","Xue, Jianchao;Wang, Deren;Li, Menghao;Jia, Ruixia",2019-10-15,Ceramics International,"Gamma alumina coating,Cathodic plasma electrolytic deposition,Silicon modification,High-temperature phase transition,Catalysis",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.186,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.186
Fabrication and characterization of functionally graded hydroxyapatite/TiO2 multilayer coating on Ti–6Al–4V titanium alloy for biomedical applications,"Single layer, double layer and functionally graded coatings of hydroxyapatite and TiO2 particles were deposited on Ti–6Al–4V titanium alloy substrate by electrophoretic deposition technique (EPD) in the acetylacetone medium. Optimum conditions to obtain stable suspensions for EPD of each type of coatings were estimated by investigating the effect of iodine concentration on the zeta-potential. In addition the effect of the applied voltage, during EPD process and polyethylenimine (PEI) concentration as binder on the coatings quality (formation of crack free coatings) was investigated. The results showed the formation of more intact coatings deposited at 20V applied voltage from suspensions containing 0.6g/L iodine and 4g/L PEI additives. The coatings chemical composition, morphology and HA decomposition behavior were investigated using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) methods. The results showed that HA starts to decompose at lower temperature in functionally graded HA/TiO2 coating (900°C). The adhesion strengths of the coatings were measured by shear testing and the results showed that the HA/TiO2 functionally graded coating has more adhesion strength (~31MPa) compare to HA single layer and HA–TiO2 double layer coatings.","Araghi, A.;Hadianfard, M.J.",2015-12-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Preparation and Characterization of Fe3O4@SiO2@NMDP core-shell structure composite magnetic nanoparticles,"Fe3O4@SiO2@nimodipine(NMDP) core-shell structure nanoparticles were prepared successfully by sonochemical method. The composite magnetic nanoparticles with SiO2 coating are effective and accurate for completing the delivery of NMDP in vitro. The samples are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Drug release was detected by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The result shows the release rate of NMDP reach to 61.3% in a short time of 40min in the PBS, and to 100% in a time of 60min. The Fe3O4@SiO2@NMDP NPs prepared show a super-paramagnetic property with a saturation magnetization value of 21.4emu/g.

Effect of pulsed electron beam treatment on the physico-mechanical properties of hydroxyapatite-coated titanium,"The effect of the pulsed electron beam (PEB) treatment on the structure and morphology of the hydroxyapatite (HA) coating deposited on the surfaces of titanium substrates by radio frequency magnetron sputtering was elucidated. The structure, composition and morphology of the samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results collected from SEM experiments demonstrated that the HA film was smooth and featureless. The samples were irradiated by PEB using an electron beam energy density of 0.1Jcm−2, electron beam pulse duration of 50μs, pulse repetition frequency of 5Hz, and number of pulses N=50 and N=150. After PEB treatment with N=50, the coating exhibited a much finer uniform surface morphology, playing a crucial role in the enhancement of the mechanical properties of the HA-coated titanium substrate. The surface of the HA film treated with N=150 was still smooth and featureless. The XRD data demonstrated that PEB treatment of HA films produced only a slight decrease in the HA phase content. The combination of these two techniques opens the possibility of preparing high quality HA layers.","Surmeneva, M.A.;Chudinova, E.A.;Grubova, I.Yu.;Korneva, O.S.;Shulepov, I.A.;Teresov, A.D.;Koval, N.N.;Mayer, J.;Oehr, C.;Surmenev, R.A.",2016-01-31,Ceramics International,"Pulsed electron beam treatment,Acid etching,RF-magnetron sputtering,Calcium phosphate,Hydroxyapatite coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.09.092,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.09.092
Cyclic oxidation in burner rig of TiAlN coating deposited on Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb by reactive HiPIMS,"The Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb intermetallic alloy was coated by using a mixed titanium-aluminum nitride with the aim of improving its oxidation resistance. The protective TiAlN coatings were obtained by reactive High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS) technique. The surface of the Ti-Al alloy was prepared for HiPIMS according to different methods; the deposition of an intermediate Ti-Al interlayer was also investigated. A cyclic oxidation test (100 and 200 cycles) was performed up to 950°C in burner rig apparatus adopting severe heating and cooling rates. The microstructure and composition of samples before and after oxidation were investigated by several techniques: microscopy (optical and SEM-EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The oxide layers formed on the sample surface showed different thickness and composition depending on the presence of the protective coating and the processing path adopted for its deposition. The nitride coatings appreciably enhanced the oxidation resistance and sustained repeated thermal shocks without showing damage or spallation.","Badini, C.;Deambrosis, S.M.;Ostrovskaya, O.;Zin, V.;Padovano, E.;Miorin, E.;Castellino, M.;Biamino, S.",2017-05-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Macro/micro structure dependence of mechanical strength of low temperature sintered silicon carbide ceramic foams,"SiC foams with high strength were prepared by polymer replica technique, including coating with SiC slurry (using Al2O3 and Y2O3 as the sintering additives) and polymer replica removal. The results suggest that the macro porous structure, including the pore size and the strut diameter, could be controlled by choosing different polymer sponge templates with the different PPI (pores per inch) values and slurry coating times. Liquid phase sintering plays a significant role in the low temperature densification of the cell struts of SiC foams. The compressive strength increased significantly with the tendency of cell strut densification. SiC ceramic foams with PPI value of 20, porosity of 77%, highly densified strut microstructure and maximum compressive strength of 2.48MPa were obtained at 1700°C with SiC as the main phase.","Chen, Fei;Yang, Ying;Shen, Qiang;Zhang, Lianmeng",2012-08-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Enhanced temperature stability of Ba(Fe0.5Nb0.5)O3@SiO2 core-shell structured ceramics,"To improve the temperature stability of Ba(Fe0.5Nb0.5)O3 (abbreviated as BFN) ceramics, the core-shell structure of Ba(Fe0.5Nb0.5)O3@SiO2 (abbreviated as BFN@SiO2) particles were successfully prepared by aqueous chemical coating approach. The effect of insulating SiO2 layer on the microstructures and dielectric properties of BFN ceramics was investigated. TEM shows that the thin SiO2 layers (about 3nm) were uniformly and smoothly coated on the surface of BFN particles. The sintering temperature of BFN@SiO2 ceramics was significantly reduced, yet the grain size remains so smaller than that of pure BFN, which attributes to the separation along the grain boundaries of insulating SiO2 layer. It was found that the temperature stability of dielectric constant of the BFN@SiO2 ceramics were significantly enhanced, as TCC (temperature coefficient of capacitance) within ±15% was from −55°C to 74°C at 1kHz and −37°C to 116°C at 10kHz. Moreover, the room temperature dielectric loss (tan δ) was obviously decreased to 0.18 at 1kHz and 0.10 at 10kHz. The reason for the enhanced temperature stability of BFN@SiO2 is that the critical temperature of dielectric relaxation occurred of BFN@SiO2 ceramics moved to lower temperature comparing with pure BFN ceramics, which leads to the dielectric constant step becoming much broader corresponding to the reduction of the activation energy (from 0.298eV to 0.134eV). The enhanced temperature stability and reduction of dielectric loss are related to the reduced hopping of charge carriers.","Wang, Chun;Wang, Zhuo;Wang, Tian;Xiao, Yu-Jia",2017-08-31,Ceramics International,"Perovskites,Dielectric properties,Capacitors",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.226,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.226
Dielectric and piezoelectric properties of PMN-PT ceramics doped with strontium,"Motivated by the need of piezoelectric ceramics with enhanced piezoelectric properties, we investigated the effects of Sr addition on the structural, dielectric and piezoelectric properties of PMN-PT ceramics.

When x=0.35, it was found that y=0.02 gave the optimal piezoelectric properties. Furthermore, by keeping y=0.02 and varying x, it was found that x=0.37 gave even better piezoelectric properties with the optimal piezoelectric strain coefficient d33 (630 pC/N), piezoelectric coupling factor kp (0.52), dielectric constant εr (4000), and Curie temperature Tc (210°C), exhibiting great potential for actuator and sensor applications.","Kalem, Volkan;Shih, Wan Y.;Shih, Wei-Heng",2018-02-15,Ceramics International,"Piezoelectric properties,Dielectric properties,PMN-PT,Isovalent doping,Coating method",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.029,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.029
Protective coatings for carbon bonded carbon fibre composites,"Carbon bonded carbon fibre composites (CBCF) were modified by direct reaction with molten silicon in order to obtain a silicon carbide layer on the composite surface. Subsequently, the Si-infiltrated CBCF material was coated with a silica-based glass containing yttria and alumina by means of a slurry-dipping technique. On heat treatment the glass yielded a glass-ceramic layer thus giving a multi-layered oxidation and erosion protection system. The microstructural characterisation of the coating was conducted by standard microscopy techniques and by X-ray diffraction. The controlled crystallization of the glass-produced cristobalite, yttrium silicate (Y2Si2O7, keiviite, β-form) and mullite as main crystalline phases. These are excellent ceramic materials for oxidation and erosion protection of SiC-coated carbon-based composites since their coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) closely match that of SiC. The possibility of healing (closure) of micro cracks by a thermal treatment at 1375°C, thus exploiting the viscous flow of the residual glass in the glass-ceramic, was explored in order to extend the service life of the protection system.","Smeacetto, F.;Ferraris, M.;Salvo, M.;Ellacott, S.D.;Ahmed, A.;Rawlings, R.D.;Boccaccini, A.R.",2008-07-31,Ceramics International,"D.

The structure and morphology of the thin films were characterized using X-ray diffraction and field-emission scanning electron microscopy. The anatase phase TiO2 thin films were obtained with post-deposition annealing at 400–700°C. The crystallinity of TiO2 thin films mainly depended on the concentration of CNO and annealing temperature.

Molybdenum doped TiO2 nanocomposite coatings: Visible light driven photocatalytic self-cleaning of mineral substrates,"The molybdenum doped TiO2 nanocomposite layer double hydroxide (LDH) suspensions, Mo:TiO2-LDHs, were synthesized by a wet impregnation method in order to enhance the pure TiO2 (water suspension) photocatalytic activity and consequently its self-cleaning efficiency under exposure to visible light. The aim was to produce nanocomposites by a simple, energy saving and cost beneficial synthesis. The mass ratio Mo/Ti was systematically varied (0.03, 0.06, 0.09, 0.12). The obtained nanocomposite Mo:TiO2-LDH suspensions were first characterized by UV–vis spectroscopy (band-gap energies), Zeta-sizer (particle size distribution and stability) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) (structure) and then applied onto the model mineral substrates, brick and stone. The photocatalytic activity of the obtained coating was determined based on the degradation kinetics of the Rhodamine B (RhB) under artificial visible light irradiation (white LED). The obtained results were compared to the ones of the unmodified TiO2-LDH suspension. The obtained results also showed that all prepared nanocomposites have good photocatalytic activity, particularly the suspension Mo:TiO2-LDH with the Mo/Ti 0.03 mass ratio which possesses the best value.

The annealing temperature dependent electrical properties of ZrO2 films were determined by capacitance–voltage (C–V) and leakage current density–voltage (J–V) measurements. Based on the implementation as gate insulator, the solution-processed ZrO2-based MOS capacitor showed good and stable performances during annealing at 700°C.

For this, several compositions based on sodium or potassium and different reactivities of metakaolin and their interactions in the presence of different types of support were studied. The interactions between the binder and substrate were analysed by measurements of the wetting angles. Coating trials conducted over tin-plated copper and bonded sand highlighted the influences of the binder composition and the drying and deposition parameters. Scanning electronic and optical microscopy observations confirm the chemical adhesion between the various components. FTIR spectroscopic analyses have also identified the parameters for obtaining a geopolymer network such as the reactive aluminium concentration (5a.u.) and the molar Si/Al and M/Al (M=K or Na) ratios (2 and 1.2, respectively). It is therefore possible, by determining the wetting angle, to control the deposition on either a metal or silica sand.","Vidal, L.;Joussein, E.;Absi, J.;Rossignol, S.",2017-02-01,Ceramics International,"Spectroscopy,Surfaces,Chemical properties,Clays",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.140,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.140
Feasibility of glass–ceramic coatings on alumina prosthetic implants by airbrush spraying method,"This work explores the feasibility of glass-derived coatings (SiO2–CaO–Na2O–Al2O3 system) on bioceramic devices of complex shape by a layer-wise slurry deposition using an airbrush spray gun. Specifically, glass–ceramic coatings with thickness in the 50–500μm range were prepared on alumina curved substrates by airbrush spraying of glass-based aqueous suspensions followed by sintering. Investigations by scanning electron microscopy and micro-computed tomography revealed that, under appropriate optimization of slurry composition and spraying cycles, this technique is suitable to manufacture homogeneous and continuous coatings on model curved ceramic surfaces. It was observed that neither cracking nor delamination occurred at the interface between coating and substrate. Ad-hoc tensile tests were carried out by properly adapting the relevant ASTM standard to the specific case (curved geometry); the coating adhesion strength was found adequate (about 25MPa) for biomedical applications. A simple model describing the relationship between coating thickness and number of spraying cycles was also developed and proposed as a useful tool to improve the design and manufacturing of bioceramic coatings.","Baino, Francesco;Vitale-Brovarone, Chiara",2015-03-31,Ceramics International,"Coating,Bioceramic,Deposition,Joint prosthesis",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.10.015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.10.015
Sol-gel synthesis and characterization of ZrO2-25wt.%CeO2-2.5wt.%Y2O3 (CYSZ) nanoparticles,"This study is intended to improve the high-temperature properties of micro-CYSZ: ZrO2-25 wt%CeO2-2.5 wt%Y2O3 in order to apply it in new generation of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) through substituting micro-CYSZ with nano-CYSZ. Nano-CYSZ was synthesized by sol-gel method followed by calcination for 3 h at 1000 °C, and subsequently underwent a heat treatment at 1300 °C for 50 h. Results obtained from Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermogravimetry/differential scanning calorimetry (TGA/DSC) indicated the formation of Zr–Y–Ce bonds, and proper calcination at 1000 °C, respectively. The microstructure and morphology of the product was studied by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), revealing the formation of CYSZ nanoparticles with the mean size of 40 nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman analysis also confirmed the formation of non-transformable (t') ZrO2 phase ( c a 2 <1.01) as well as the stability of this phase after heat treatment. Results suggest nano-CYSZ as a promising choice for advanced TBCs in the new aero-engine and power generation applications.","Keyvani, A.;Bahamirian, M.;Esmaeili, B.",2020-09-30,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs),ZrO2-25wt.%CeO2-2.5wt.%Y2O3,Sol-gel method,Phase stability,T'-ZrO2",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.219,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.219
Formation of Al2O3–TiO2 composite oxide films on aluminum foil by cathodic electrodeposition and anodizing,"Titanium dioxide (TiO2) thin films were deposited on aluminum foils by cathodic electrodeposition, and then Al2O3–TiO2 (Al–Ti) composite oxide films were formed on aluminum foils by anodizing in 15wt% ammonium adipate solution. The composition and structure of TiO2 coating layer were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The morphologies of specimens at different stages in the preparation process were characterized by atomic force microscope (AFM). The growth mechanism of the Al–Ti composite oxide film was discussed. It was found that TiO2 coating layer with anatase structure was obtained on aluminum foil after heat treatment. The TiO2 film showed an island growth pattern, which favored the growth of Al2O3 from uneven channel in the coating layer, thus promoting the formation of the Al–Ti composite oxide film. The anodic oxidation efficiency of specimens increased with the current density of cathodic electrodeposition increasing. The specimen with the Al–Ti composite oxide film exhibited about 26.3% higher product of specific capacitance and withstanding voltage than that with pure aluminum oxide film.","Feng, Zhe-Sheng;Chen, Jin-Ju;Zhang, Chuan;Zhao, Ning;Liang, Zi",2012-04-30,Ceramics International,"Aluminum foil,Al–Ti composite oxide films,Cathodic electrodeposition,Anodizing",10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.11.019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.11.019
Effect of withdrawal rate on the evolution of optical properties of dip-coated yttria-doped zirconia thin films,"In this work, the Swanepoel method is described and applied for determining various optical parameters and thicknesses of dip–coated yttria–doped zirconia thin films. Using this method the influence of the withdrawal rate on optical parameters was studied. The characterization of the deposited thin films was carried out by optical microscopy and FT–IR spectrophotometry. As expected, coating thickness was closely related to the withdrawal rate and consequently influenced optical parameters such as refractive index, extinction coefficient, and absorption coefficient. Regarding the average refractive index of the prepared thin films, n is in the 2.0 – 2.2 range, the higher refractive index average value being obtained with films deposited at 25mmmin−1 (n = 2.19). The value of the optical band gap was also studied, this increased with withdrawal rate and was quite similar to values reported by other investigators at 50, 25 and 10mmmin−1. Thus, this study proposes analysing the influence of the withdrawal rate for the manufacture of different types of thin films with previously specified optical parameters.","Encinas-Sánchez, V.;Macías-García, A.;Pérez, F.J.",2017-11-30,Ceramics International,"Thin films,Sol–gel,Yttria–doped zirconia,Optical properties,Swanepoel method",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.198,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.198
Glass–ceramics as oxidation resistant bond coat in thermal barrier coating system,"Thermal barrier coating (TBC) system consisting of yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) top coat, glass–ceramic bond coat and nickel base superalloy substrate was subjected to static oxidation test at 1200°C for 500h in air. Oxidation resistance of this TBC system was compared with the conventional TBC system under identical heat treatment condition. Both the TBC systems were characterized by SEM as well as EDX analysis. No TGO layer was found between the bond coat and the top coat in the case of glass–ceramic bonded TBC system while the conventional TBC system exhibited a TGO layer of about 16μm thickness at the bond coat-top coat interface region.","Das, S.;Datta, S.;Basu, D.;Das, G.C.",2009-05-31,Ceramics International,"D.

Fabrication and characterization of in-situ duplex plasma-treated nanocrystalline Ti/AlTiN coatings,"Plasma nitriding and plasma-assisted PVD duplex treatment was adopted to improve the load-bearing capacity, fatigue resistance and adhesion of the AlTiN coating. Ion etch-cleaning was applied for better adhesion before plasma nitriding. After plasma nitriding Ti interlayer was in-situ deposited by high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HIPIMS), followed by the AlTiN coating through in-situ deposition by advanced plasma-assisted arc (APA-Arc). The microstructure and properties of the duplex-treated coating were carefully characterized and analyzed. The results show that the thicknesses of the nitriding zone, the γ′-Fe4N compound layer, the Ti interlayer and the AlTiN top layer with nanocrystalline microstructures are about 60μm, 2–3μm, 100nm and 6.1μm, respectively. The nitriding rate is about 30μm/h and the AlTiN coating deposition rate reaches 6.1μm/h. The interfacial adhesion of the Ti/AlTiN coating is well enhanced by ion etch-cleaning and a Ti interlayer, and the load-bearing capacity is also improved by duplex treatment. In addition, the instinct hardness of the Ti/AlTiN coating reaches 3368HV0.05 while the wear rate coefficient of 5.394×10−8 mm−3/Nm is sufficiently low. The Ti/AlTiN coating, which possesses a high corrosion potential (E corr=−104.6mV) and a low corrosion current density (i corr=4.769μA/cm2), shows highly protective efficiency to the substrate.","Tan, Chaolin;Kuang, Tongchun;Zhou, Kesong;Zhu, Hongmei;Deng, Yang;Li, Xueping;Cai, Panpan;Liu, Zongwen",2016-07-31,Ceramics International,"Plasma nitriding,Duplex treatment,HIPIMS,AlTiN,Ti interlayer,Arc",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.03.207,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.03.207
Effect of physical vapor deposited Al2O3 film on TGO growth in YSZ/CoNiCrAlY coatings,"Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) comprising of yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) ceramic top coat and CoNiCrAlY metallic bond coat have been widely used in gas turbines. However, the developed oxides layer in the interface of the top and bond coats during thermal exposure of the TBCs always results in the destruction of the system. In order to restrain the growth of oxides layer and improve the thermal shock resistance of TBCs, a thin Al2O3 film was pre-deposited on CoNiCrAlY bond coat by physical vapor deposition (PVD) technology. After thermal exposure, morphologies and phase compositions of the thermal growth oxides (TGO) layer in the conventional and pre-deposited Al2O3 film TBCs were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The residual stresses in the coatings were analyzed using micro-Raman spectroscopy (LabRam-1B). It was found that TGO layer formed in the conventional TBCs was mainly composed of Al2O3, (Cr,Al)2O3 +(Co,Ni)(Cr,Al)2O4 +NiO (CSN), and (Cr,Al)2O3 +(Co,Ni)(Cr,Al)2O4 (CS), while in the treated TBCs, the formed TGO layer appeared more uniform and compact. The CSN and CS clusters, which are normally considered as a weakness for TBCs, were greatly limited. The residual stresses in the TBCs after thermal shock were also reduced by the deposition of Al2O3 film.","Li, Yanjun;Xie, Youtao;huang, Liping;Liu, Xuanyong;Zheng, Xuebin",2012-08-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Oxidation protection of commercial-purity titanium by Na2O–CaO–SiO2 and Na2O–CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 glass–ceramic coatings,"Na2O–CaO–SiO2 and Na2O–CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 glass–ceramic coatings were first prepared on commercial-purity titanium TA1 to improve its high temperature oxidation resistance. The Na2O–CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 glass–ceramic coating showed better sintering behavior than the Na2O–CaO–SiO2 glass–ceramic coating. Both glass–ceramic coatings clearly decreased the oxidation rate of TA1 at 800°C. After high temperature oxidation, both glass–ceramic coatings showed a good adhesion to the TA1 substrate. Between the Na2O–CaO–SiO2 glass–ceramic coating and the TA1 substrate, a Ti5Si3 interface layer was observed as a result of the reaction between SiO2 in the glass and Ti. While for the Na2O–CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 glass–ceramic coating, diffusion of Al to the TA1 could also be seen under the Ti5Si3 interface layer. Cross-sectional EDS line scanning images of the glass–ceramic coatings showed that diffusion of the elements such as O, Ca and Na into TA1 was negligible, suggesting that both glass–ceramic coatings were suitable for protection of TA1 against high temperature oxidation.","Xiao, Zunqi;Tan, Fatang;Wang, Wei;Lu, Hongfei;Cai, Yuncheng;Qiu, Xiaolin;Chen, Jianguo;Qiao, Xueliang",2015-01-31,Ceramics International,"Commercial-purity titanium,Glass–ceramics,Coating,Oxidation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.08.075,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.08.075
"Effect of pack cementation temperatures on component, microstructure and anti-oxidation performance of Al-modified SiC coatings on C/C composites","SiC coatings doped with Al were synthesized on the C/C composites using the pack cementation technique. We explored the microstructure, composition, as well as anti-oxidation performance of Al-doped SiC coatings with different preparation temperatures (1500–2100 °C). The results prove that the coatings prepared at 1500–1900 °C are discontinuous 3C–SiC/2H–SiC/C/Si/Al2O3 coatings with some holes and micro-cracks, while the coating prepared at 2100 °C is Al atoms dissolved 4H–SiC coating with inconspicuous cracks and a loose and porous surface structure. And the coating thickness and oxidation resistances are enhanced with increasing the pack cementation temperatures. Besides, the oxygen diffusion via the coating's invisible microdefects is the leading cause of the coating's oxidation produced at 2100 °C. The coating gained at 2100 °C shows the best anti-oxidation properties owing to the in situ formed Al2O3 as well as SiO2 oxide layer on their surface.","Huang, Jinguo;Guo, Lingjun;Xu, Min;Zhang, Pei",2020-04-15,Ceramics International,"Carbon/carbon composites,Coating,Oxidation,Pack cementation temperatures",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.059,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.059
Study of colloidal behaviour and rheology of Al2O3–TiO2 nanosuspensions to obtain free-flowing spray-dried granules for atmospheric plasma spraying,"This work deals with the dispersion and stabilisation of nanosized Al2O3 and TiO2 particles in aqueous medium. The dispersing conditions were studied as a function of pH, dispersant content, solid loading and ageing. Well-dispersed nanosuspensions of Al2O3 with solids contents up to 15vol.% and TiO2 with solids contents up to 30vol.% were obtained by dispersing each type of nanoparticles with 4wt% of polyacrylic acid-based polyelectrolyte. In order to obtain a concentrated 87wt% Al2O3–13wt% TiO2 suspension, a 15vol.% homogeneous nanosuspension, composed by alumina and titania nanopowders, was prepared and then reconstituted by spray-drying into free-flowing powders. This spray-dried powder showed an adequate granule size distribution, a very high flowability and a reasonable density for diverse purposes, such as to be used in atmospheric plasma spraying as a feedstock to obtain nanostructured coatings.","Vicent, Mónica;Sánchez, Enrique;Mallol, Gustavo;Moreno, Rodrigo",2013-09-30,Ceramics International,"A.

Bipolar resistive switching characteristics of PbZrO3/LaNiO3 heterostructure thin films prepared by a sol–gel process,"Herein, PbZrO3 (PZO) films with good density and homogeneity were grown on a LaNiO3 (LNO)-buffered Si(100) substrate by a conventional and low-cost sol–gel spin-coating technique. The results indicated that the PZO films prepared on the LNO/Si substrate can be fabricated into a Au/PZO/LNO/Si heterojunction device via annealing at 650 °C under an air atmosphere. The device exhibited excellent and repeatable bipolar resistance switching (RS) behavior at room temperature. Its high/low resistance ratio reached 102 at +0.2 and -0.2 V bias voltages, and the RS characteristics of the device did not significantly deteriorate after 100 consecutive cycles of testing. Weibull distribution results show that the proposed device has a uniform and stable high/low-resistance state. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the conduction mechanisms of the device are Ohmic conduction and Schottky emission. The modulation of a Schottky-like barrier owing to the migration of oxygen vacancies in the PZO films is considered to be responsible for the RS phenomenon of the Au/PZO/LNO/Si device.","Wang, Lun-Quan;Li, Wen-Hua;Tang, Xin-Gui;Guo, Xiao-Bin;Liu, Qiu-Xiang;Jiang, Yan-Ping;Tang, Zhen-Hua",2020-10-20,Ceramics International,"PbZrO3 films,Resistance switching,Oxygen vacancies,Conduction mechanism",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.146,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.146
"Thermal stability and sintering behavior of plasma sprayed nanostructured 7YSZ, 15YSZ and 5.5SYSZ coatings at elevated temperatures","Nanostructured scandia, yttria doped zirconia (5.5SYSZ), 7wt% yttria stabilized zirconia (7YSZ) and 15YSZ thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) were produced by plasma spraying on nickel-based superalloy substrates with NiCrAlY as the bond coat. The thermal stability and sintering behavior of the three as-sprayed TBCs at 1480°C were investigated. The results indicated that the thermal stability of SYSZ and TBCs was longer than the 7YSZ TBCs due to higher amount of tetragonal phase.

Crystal growth behavior and sintering-resistance property of nano-sized β-Yb2Si2O7 for environmental barrier coatings,"In this article, as an attractive candidate of EBCs for SiC-based ceramic matrix composites, nano-sized β-Yb2Si2O7 was synthesized by hydrothermal method. The sintering-resistance property and crystal growth behavior of β-Yb2Si2O7 powders and compacted bodies were evaluated via various techniques. Quantity analyses demonstrate that β-Yb2Si2O7 was formed at about 1100 °C, and possessed well thermal stability at even higher temperatures. The determined coefficient of thermal expansion and thermal conductivity are 4.63 × 10-6 K-1 and 1.72 W m-1 K-1, respectively. The microstructures of compacted bodies under different temperatures reveal the critical temperature of anti-sintering is about 1400 °C. Based on different growth mechanisms, the activation energy of crystal growth (Q) can be segmented into two sections with a turning point of 1076 °C.

Electrochemical properties and microstructures of LiMn2O4 cathodes coated with aluminum zirconium coupling agents,"In this study, we developed a novel and facile modification method to improve the performance of LiMn2O4 (LMO) electrodes for lithium ion batteries. We used an aluminum-zirconium coupling agent (AZCA) to treat LMO cathodes via a simple pyrolysis method at 450 °C. The microstructures and properties of the cathodes were examined by carrying out X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and electrochemical analyses. The results showed that an amorphous Al2O3/ZrO2 composite layer was uniformly coated on the surface of the positive material, and the thickness of the coating was about 6 nm. The coating did not affect the particle morphology and crystal structure of the samples. However, it could enhance the surface stability and result in reducing the polarization, improving the rate properties and cycle reversibility of LMO especially at high temperatures. The optimum AZCA amount for the deposition of the composite coating was found to be 3 wt%. After coating, the discharge capacity of LMO at 3C increased by 14.37% and 74.95% at 25 and 55 °C, respectively. Noteworthy, after 100 cycles at 55 °C and 1C rate, the capacity retention of LMO increased from 61.3% to 88.1%. The improvement in the properties of the AZCA-treated LMO cathodes can be attributed to the synergy between Al2O3 and ZrO2, which improved the chemical stability of the cathode surface, suppressed the side reaction between the cathode and the electrolyte and enhanced the reversible deinsertion/insertion ability of Li+. In addition, the composite coating can greatly stabilize the crystal structure of LMO during charging-discharging cycling.","Wang, Sunfa;Luo, Chengguo;Feng, Yanyan;Fan, Guangxin;Feng, Lanlan;Ren, Mingming;Liu, Baozhong",2020-06-15,Ceramics International,"Lithium-ion batteries,LiMn2O4 cathode,Aluminum-zirconium coupling agent,Surface treatment,Electrochemical performances",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.070,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.02.070
Nanostructured TiCrN thin films by Pulsed Magnetron Sputtering for cutting tool applications,"Nanostructured Titanium chromium nitride (TiCrN) thin films at different pulsed frequencies were grown on steels by pulsed reactive DC magnetron sputtering technique. The crystal structure and morphology of the TiCrN films sputtered at different frequencies were characterized. The surface composition and chemical states of each element in TiCrN thin films were studied by ion scattering spectroscopy (ISS) and X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS).The electrochemical corrosion behavior of the coated steels was monitored by both impedance spectroscopy and potentiodynamic polarization technique in 3.5% NaCl at room temperature. A block on ring wear tester was used to monitor the variation of coefficient of friction with different sputtering frequency. The mechanical applications of TiCrN thin films were studied by fabricating the thin films on micro drill bits and testing it on 1mm thick steel plates. A superior surface finish, diameter precision of the hole, reduced material build up on the cutting edges and finally increased tool life were obtained with TiCrN coated HSS drill bits. Machining tests were conducted by coating the inserts with TiCrN thin films.","Thampi, V.V.

Optical and surface properties of hybrid TiO2/ormosil planar waveguide prepared by the sol–gel process,"Two kinds of silanes, 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GLYMO) and 3-trimethoxysililpropylmethacrylate (TMSPM), were used to prepare ormosil waveguide films by the sol–gel method. Thirty percent Ti(OBu)4 and 70% silane were contained in the precursor sols. The properties of films were measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer (UV–vis), atomic force microscopy (AFM), m-line and scattering-detection method. The films from GLYMO and TMSPM precursors exhibit similar thickness (2.58μm for GLYMO, 2.51μm for TMSPM) and refractive index (1.5438 for GLYMO, 1.5392 for TMSPM, λ =632.8nm), but the film from TMSPM precursor has higher propagation loss (1.024dB/cm, λ =632.8nm) than the film prepared from GLYMO (0.569dB/cm, λ =632.8nm). Furthermore, the film prepared from TMSPM is easy to be opaque and cracks during coating whereas the same phenomenon was not found for the film prepared with GLYMO. It is confirmed that GLYMO is a better precursor than TMSPM for waveguide film preparation.","Wang, Baoling;Hu, Lili",2006-12-31,Ceramics International,"C.

Ceramic TiC/a:C protective nanocomposite coatings: Structure and composition versus mechanical properties and tribology,"The relationship between the structure, elemental composition, mechanical and tribological properties of TiC/amorphous carbon (TiC/a:C) nanocomposite thin films was investigated. TiC/a:C thin film of different compositions were sputtered by DC magnetron sputtering at room temperature. In order to prepare the thin films with various morphology only the sputtering power of Ti source was modified besides constant power of C source. The elemental composition of the deposited films and structural investigations confirmed the inverse changes of the a:C and titanium carbide (TiC) phases. The thickness of the amorphous carbon matrix decreased from 10nm to 1–2nm simultaneously with the increasing Ti content from 6at% to 47at%. The highest hardness (H) of ~26GPa and modulus of elasticity (E) of ~220GPa with friction coefficient of 0.268 was observed in case of the film prepared at ~38at% Ti content which consisted of 4–10nm width TiC columns separated by 2–3nm thin a:C layers. The H3/E2 ratio was ~0.4GPa that predicts high resistance to plastic deformation of the TiC based nanocomposites beside excellent wear-resistant properties (H/E=0.12).","Oláh, Nikolett;Fogarassy, Zsolt;Sulyok, Attila;Szívós, János;Csanádi, Tamás;Balázsi, Katalin",2016-08-01,Ceramics International,"TiC/a:C thin film,TEM,Tribology,Mechanical properties,XPS",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.164,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.164
Oxidation behavior of plasma-sprayed MoSi2-Yb2O3 composite coating at 1700 °C,"Rare earths with unique electronic structure and properties have incomparable advantages for modifying the comprehensive performance of silicide materials. In this study, MoSi2-based composite coatings with different rare-earth Yb2O3 contents were prepared using supersonic atmospheric plasma spraying, and their microstructural features and oxidation behavior at 1700 °C were investigated systematically. Results showed that the sprayed MoSi2-Yb2O3 composite coating possessed the dense structure without visible defects and tightly adhered to the SiC transition layer. During oxidation at 1700 °C, all the samples exhibited an explicit linear oxidation mode, in which the MoSi2-10 wt%Yb2O3 coating qualified the optimal oxidation resistance with the lowest specific mass loss relative to other coatings. It was natural to consider that the Yb2O3 dopant changed the microstructural aspects of the formed oxide scale upon oxidation, and then affecting the oxidation behavior of the applied coating. Moderate doping of Yb2O3 stabilized the Si–O covalent bonds in SiO2 network, leading to the enhanced viscosity of oxide glass scale, thereby delaying the effective delivery of oxygen molecules as well as the oxidation degradation of the coating.","Wang, Chang-Cong;Li, Ke-Zhi;He, Dan-Yang;Shi, Xiao-Hong",2020-05-31,Ceramics International,"SAPS,MoSi2,Yb2O3,Coating,Oxidation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.216,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.216
Effects of creep-plastic behavior on stress development in TBCs during cooling,"The stress development, as the main cause of TBCs failure, can be significantly influenced by the non-linear behaviors of TBCs materials (e.g. plastic and creep deformations). Description of the non-linear behaviors of TBCs materials is crucial to accurate stress evaluation. However, conventional constitutive models couldn't distinguish the role of the nonlinear plastic and creep deformations in the stress evaluation, which may lead to obvious difference. This work employs the creep-plastic constitutive model to study the effects of creep-plastic behavior of BC and TGO on the TC/TGO/BC interface stress development. This creep-plastic model reveals that the stress can be identified in three sections when BC creep properties varies in wide margins: In the first section with a small BC creep rate, plastic deformation mainly influences the interface stresses; in the second section with a medium creep rate, both creep and plastic deformations affect the stress development; in the third section with a larger creep rate, creep becomes the main factor dominating the relaxing process. It is also found that if the creep in TGO is considered, the stresses will be overall relaxed no matter if BC is plastic, creep or creep-plastic.

For this purpose 2.5wt% silver substituted hydroxyapatite (AgHA) nanoparticles were prepared by microwave processing technique and were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) methods. The as-synthesized AgHA particles with particle length ranging from 60 to 70nm and width ranging from 15 to 20nm were used for the subsequent development of coating on Cp Ti. The PEP treated Cp Ti showed both titania and AgHA in its coating and exhibited an improved corrosion resistance in 7.4 pH simulated body fluid (SBF) and 4.5 pH osteoclast bioresorbable conditions compared to untreated Cp Ti. The in vitro bioactivity test conducted under Kokubo SBF conditions indicated an enhanced apatite forming ability of PEP treated Cp Ti surface compared to that of the untreated Cp Ti. The Kirby–Bauer disc diffusion method or antibiotic sensitivity test conducted with the test organisms of Escherichia coli (E. coli) for 24h showed a significant zone of inhibition for PEP treated Cp Ti compared to untreated Cp Ti.","Venkateswarlu, Kotharu;Rameshbabu, Nagumothu;Chandra Bose, Arumugam;Muthupandi, Veerappan;Subramanian, Sankaran;MubarakAli, Davoodbasha;Thajuddin, Nooruddin",2012-01-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Enhanced photocatalytic degradation of tri-chlorophenol by Fe3O4@TiO2@Au photocatalyst under visible-light,"Heterogeneous Fe3O4@TiO2@Au core-shell microspheres, a facile and highly efficient catalyst have been fabricated by a simple surface modification. The fabrication process involved the coating of TiO2 nanoshell onto the magnetic core using by sol-gel process, and then the anchoring of Au nanoparticles onto the surface of the Fe3O4@TiO2 microspheres through the wet chemical reaction of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES). The as-synthesized Fe3O4@TiO2 microspheres exhibited a narrow size distribution, with a typical size of 350 nm and shell thickness of 25 nm. The Fe3O4@TiO2@Au microspheres can be easily collected by applying external magnetic field due to the magnetic property of core Fe3O4 particles. Compared to unmodified Fe3O4@TiO2 microspheres, the Fe3O4@TiO2@Au microspheres showed higher photocatalytic activity for 2, 4, 6-trichlorophenol (TCP). The photocatalytic efficiency of the Fe3O4@TiO2 microspheres was 28% after 40 min irradiation while, the efficiency of Fe3O4@TiO2@Au microspheres was 98% at the same condition.","Choi, Kyong-Hoon;Min, Jeeeun;Park, So-Yeong;Park, Bong Joo;Jung, Jin-Seung",2019-05-31,Ceramics International,"Fe3O4@TiO2@Au microspheres,Core-shell microstructure,2, 4, 6-trichlorophenol,Photocatalytic activity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.104,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.104
Preparation of MgO-coated BaTiO3 particles through a surface-induced precipitation method,"The effect of particle size of BaTiO3 on the preparation of magnesia-coated BaTiO3 particles was studied through a surface-induced precipitation method. MgO-coated BaTiO3 particles were prepared by a homogeneous precipitation method using MgCl2·6H2O and urea. Particle sizes of starting BaTiO3 powders were ∼30 and ∼400nm, respectively. Amorphous magnesia precursor with ∼10nm was heat treated and transformed to crystalline MgO. Crystallization of MgO was observed at the temperature range between 600 and 700°C. Zeta potentials were all negative such as −2mV for MgO, −18mV for 400nm BaTiO3 and −22mV for 30nm BaTiO3 at pH 7.0. The MgO-coating layer was observed on BaTiO3 particles with ∼400nm, whereas none of the coating layer was observed on BaTiO3 with ∼30nm. According to calculation of the total interaction potential energy, the most strong attraction energy was observed between 400nm BaTiO3 and MgO particles.","Park, Jae Sung;Han, Young Ho",2006-12-31,Ceramics International,"BaTiO3,Mg,Homogeneous precipitation,Coating,Hetero-coagulation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2005.05.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2005.05.005
Processing and fracture behaviour of hot pressed silicon carbide whisker reinforced alumina,"The improvement of mechanical properties of silicon carbide whisker reinforced alumina has been investigated with emphasis on the effects of the whisker type and content, the hot pressing temperature and the influence of an interfacial film between the whisker and the matrix. The introduction of silicon carbide whiskers significantly improves the fracture toughness, flexural strength and creep resistance of polycrystalline alumina. However, these properties are strongly dependent on the size and morphology of whiskers. Large diameter whiskers generate extensive micro-cracking which leads to a decrease in flexural strength. Also, the presence of carbon-coated SiC whiskers substantially increases the high temperature strain rate by promoting cavitation. A grain boundary glassy phase introduced by the carbon coating was also detected.","Tuffe, S.;Dubois, J.;Jorand, Y.;Fantozzi, G.;Barbier, G.",1994-12-31,Ceramics International, ,10.1016/0272-8842(94)90030-2,https://doi.org/10.1016/0272-8842(94)90030-2
Preparation and properties of LaMgAl11O19 thermal barrier coatings doped with Gd2O3,"As a rare earth hexaaluminate, LaMgAl11O19 (LMA) has been one of the most promising materials used as thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). A large amount of amorphous phase, however, often exists in the plasma-sprayed LMA coating and significantly reduces the service lifetime of TBCs. In this study, La1-x Gd x MgAl11O19 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8) ceramic powders are synthesised by solid-state reaction, and all of these powders are employed to prepare the corresponding coatings. The phase compositions and microstructures of samples are examined by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The linear thermal expansion behaviour and thermal cycling behaviour of the coatings are also analysed. The results show that the amorphous phase content is decreased and the thermal expansion behaviour is improved by doping the coatings with Gd2O3. The thermal cycling lifetime of the coating, however, basically remains unchanged.","Sun, Junbin;Wang, Jinshuang;Hui, Yu;Chen, Xiaolong",2020-03-31,Ceramics International,"LaMgAl11O19,Amorphous,Gd2O3,Doping,Thermal barrier coatings",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.135,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.135

XRD patterns indicate that the nitrogen-doped carbon decorated LiFePO4 has an olivine structure. TEM result shows that a uniform thin nitrogen-doped carbon layer with a thickness of about 3nm is successfully coated on the surface of LiFePO4 particles. Compared with the pristine LiFePO4 sample, the nitrogen-doped carbon decorated LiFePO4 composite has a high discharge capacity, good rate capability and stable cycling performance. The excellent electrochemical performance should be attributed to the enhanced electronic conductivity and increased Li+ ion diffusion of the electrode by the coating with nitrogen-doped carbon.","Han, Bing;Meng, Xudong;Ma, Lin;Nan, Jingyu",2016-02-01,Ceramics International,"Lithium-ion batteries,Cathode material,LiFePO4,Carbon coating,Nitrogen-doping",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.11.011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.11.011
Ablation resistance of HfB2-SiC coating prepared by in-situ reaction method for SiC coated C/C composites,"To improve the ablation resistance of SiC coating, HfB2-SiC coating was prepared on SiC-coated carbon/carbon (C/C) composites by in-situ reaction method. Owing to the penetration of coating powders, there is no clear boundary between SiC coating and HfB2-SiC coating. After oxyacetylene ablation for 60s at heat flux of 2400kW/m2, the mass ablation rate and linear ablation rate of the coated C/C composites were only 0.147mg/s and 0.267µm/s, reduced by 21.8% and 60.0%, respectively, compared with SiC coated C/C composites. The good ablation resistance was attributed to the formation of multiple Hf-Si-O glassy layer including SiO2, HfO2 and HfSiO4.","Wang, Peipei;Li, Hejun;Jia, Yujun;Zhang, Yulei;Yuan, Ruimei",2017-10-15,Ceramics International,"Carbon/carbon composites,HfB2-SiC,Ablation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.052,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.052
Structure and properties of plasma sprayed BaTiO3 coatings after thermal posttreatment,Previously published results on electrical and mechanical properties of BaTiO3 coatings prepared by atmospheric plasma spraying showed anomalies in their dielectric response.

Influence of molten volcanic ash infiltration on the friability of APS thermal barrier coatings,"Molten siliceous deposits originating from environmental debris such as volcanic ash, pose a severe threat to the longevity of Yttria-stabilized Zirconia thermal barrier coatings (YSZ TBCs). Surface wetting of TBCs by molten volcanic ash, followed by infiltration into the TBCs, leads to both thermo-chemical and thermo-mechanical TBC deterioration. In particular, the consequences of such wetting and infiltration on the thermo-mechanical properties remain unexplored to date. Here, in-situ molten volcanic ash wetting of TBCs subjected to thermal shock at 1300 °C has been performed for the first time. We experimentally characterized the generation of micro-cracks, whose origin lies in the high elastic modulus of the infiltrated region (~262 GPa). Thermo-mechanical deterioration of the TBCs was due to the low fracture toughness and high thermal stresses (~1.67 GPa) evaluated at the infiltrated region, which were responsible for the propagation of micro-cracks in the TBCs. We provide quantification and preliminary interpretation of the thermo-mechanical degradation of TBCs under these common thermal shock conditions.","Lokachari, Siddharth;Song, Wenjia;Yuan, Jieyan;Kaliwoda, Melanie;Dingwell, Donald B.",2020-06-01,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Volcanic ash,Wetting,Thermal shock,Thermo-mechanical degradation,Yttria-stabilized zirconia",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.166,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.166
Characteristics and thermal cycling behavior of plasma-sprayed Ba(Mg1/3Ta2/3)O3 thermal barrier coatings,"Ba(Mg1/3Ta2/3)O3 (BMT) powders were synthesized by the solid state reaction method. BMT thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) were deposited by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS). The phase composition and microstructure of the BMT coatings were characterized. The thermal cycling behavior of the BMT coatings was investigated by the water quenching method from 1150°C to room temperature. The results reveal that BMT powders have an ordered hexagonal perovskite structure, whereas the as-sprayed coating of BMT has a disordered cubic perovskite structure because of the different degree of structural order for different treatment conditions. During thermal cycling testing, the entire spalling of coatings occurred within the BMT coating near the bond coat. This is attributed to the following reasons: (1) the growth of a thermally grown oxides (TGO) layer, which leads to additional stresses in the coatings; (2) the coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch between the BMT coating and bond coat, which develops enormous stress in the coatings; (3) the precipitation of Ba3Ta5O15 due to the evaporation of MgO during the spraying process, which changes the continuity of the coatings.","Cao, Yupeng;Wang, Quansheng;Liu, Yanbo;Ning, Xianjin;Wang, Hao",2017-10-01,Ceramics International,"Perovskite structure,Thermal barrier coatings,Atmospheric plasma spraying,Thermal cycling behavior",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.134,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.134
Optimization and characterization of laser cladding of NiCr and NiCr–TiC composite coatings on AISI 420 stainless steel,"AISI 420 Martensitic stainless steel is the major precursor for steam turbine blades. Under the operational conditions of the steam turbine, this steel undergoes erosion because of the impingement of water droplets. The aim of this research is the laser cladding of NiCr and NiCr–TiC powders and producing metal matrix composite NiCr–TiC on stainless steel substrate to enhance the rigidity and erosion resistance of AISI 420 stainless steel. The laser cladding was performed using pulsed Nd: YAG laser with concurrent powder injection. By setting the powder feeding rate, power, and laser scanning rate, the effect of each parameter on the laser cladding process was investigated and the optimal parameters for laser cladding were chosen. The elemental, phasic, and microstructural assessments and characterizations of the obtained coatings were done by optical microscope, scanning electron microscope, alongside energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction. It was observed that the structure of the clad from the interface upwards consists of cellular, columnar, and coaxial dendrites. It was also seen that the hardness of the composite clad containing reinforcement particles was far greater than that of cladding without such particles because of the increased effect of nucleation and the presence of TiC particles. It was also found that the weight loss of the composite clad of NiCr–TiC was less than that of NiCr and stainless steel substrate, while its erosion resistance was greater compared to NiCr and steel substrate.","Saeedi, Rasool;Shoja Razavi, Reza;Bakhshi, Saeed Reza;Erfanmanesh, Mohammad;Ahmadi Bani, Ahmad",2020-10-01,Ceramics International,"AISI 420 martensitic stainless steel,NiCr–TiC Composite coating,Laser cladding,Microstructural evaluation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.284,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.284
Enhanced La0.8Sr0.2CrO3/Pt thin film thermocouple with Al2O3 coating layer for high temperature sensing,"Thin film thermocouples (TFTCs) as a kind of passive sensor are used to measure in-situ high temperature and integrated surface devices. In this work, La0.8Sr0.2CrO3/Pt TFTCs were successfully fabricated by RF sputtering method. When the TFTCs were tested below 900 °C for multi-cycles, they showed an excellent stability and reproducibility. By comparing with the thermal responses of uncoated and coated with Al2O3 protection layer, the coated TFTC had a higher measurement temperature than uncoated TFTC, and good durability. The failure of TFTCs was mainly attributed to the volatilization of Pt and 0.2LSCO thin films at high temperature, while 0.2LSCO had a better thermal stability than Pt. The La0.8Sr0.2CrO3/Pt TFTC coated with Al2O3 protection layer may provide a new candidate thermal sensor for high temperature sensing in air.","Liu, Dan;Shi, Peng;Ren, Wei;Liu, Yantao;Liu, Ming;Zhang, Yijun;Tian, Bian;Lin, Qijing;Jiang, Zhuangde;Ye, Zuo-Guang",2018-11-30,Ceramics International,"La0.8Sr0.2CrO3,Pt,Thin film thermocouple,Al2O3,High temperature",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.107,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.107
Gradient thermal cycling behavior of a thermal barrier coating system constituted by NiCoCrAlY bond coat and pure metastable tetragonal nano-4YSZ top coat,"Pure metastable tetragonal (t’) phase 4YSZ top coats with thickness of 100 and 200 μm were deposited on NiCoCrAlY-coated second generation single crystal superalloy by air plasma spray (APS). The two thermal barrier coatings were evaluated under gradient thermal cycling test using gas mixture of propane and oxygen. After flame shock test, the values of Young's modulus, hardness and degree of densification all exhibited a gradient distribution across YSZ thickness. In contrast to intensive sintering at surface of 200 μm 4YSZ coating, the TBC sample with 4YSZ layer of 100 μm underwent poor oxidation at interface of YSZ and bond coat, forming a duplex oxide scale: (Ni,Co)(Cr,Al)2O4 spinel over Al2O3, which promoted the delamination at the top-coat/bond-coat interface. The resistance against gradient thermal cycling, the phase stability of 4YSZ and the failure mechanism of the TBCs, were discussed correlating to the effects of YSZ thickness.","Yu, C.T.;Liu, H.;Zhang, J.;Ullah, A.;Bao, Z.B.;Jiang, C.Y.;Zhu, S.L.;Wang, F.H.",2019-08-15,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coating,Yttria stabilized zirconia,Gradient thermal cycling,Sintering,Thermally grown oxide",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.018
Fabrication of zirconium oxide coatings on stainless steel by a combined laser/sol–gel technique,"A new route of combining sol–gel coating technology and laser processing is developed and used for manufacturing zirconia coatings on stainless steel substrates. In this method, sol–gel zirconia is first synthesised using zirconium (IV) tert-butoxide as precursor and a mixture of isopropanol and water as the solvent. The sol is coated on the substrate by dip-coating, and then the dried sol–gel coating is irradiated by a fibre laser at different energy densities ranging from 4.35 to 10.9J/mm2. Various techniques were applied to characterise the zirconia coatings on the substrate surfaces after laser treatment, including attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy and contact angle measurements. The results show that the fibre laser in continuous wave mode is effective to convert the as-dried amorphous xerogel coating on the substrate into zirconia coatings crystallised in tetragonal structure. The coating surface morphology varies with the laser energy densities and the highest coating uniformity is obtained at the lowest laser energy tested in this research.","Adraider, Y.;Pang, Y.X.;Nabhani, F.;Hodgson, S.N.;Sharp, M.C.;Al-Waidh, A.",2013-12-31,Ceramics International,"Sol–gel zirconia coatings,Fibre laser,Zirconium oxide,Stainless steel substrates",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.05.089,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.05.089
Fabrication of apatite-coated gypsum granules and histological evaluation using rabbits,"Calcium sulfate dihydrate (CSD) has been used as a material for bone augmentation for many years. However, rapid resorption of CSD sometimes results in insufficient formation of new bone. In the present study, the feasibility of fabricating apatite-coated CSD (Ap/CSD) was studied, with the hypothesis that the apatite coating would reduce the rate of CSD resorption and enhance the osteoconductivity. To prepare Ap/CSD granules, 300–400 µm CSD granules were immersed in Na2HPO4 solution at 20 °C or 60 °C, resulting in granules coated with apatitic precipitates. Granules were analyzed by microscopy and x-ray diffraction, and the dissolution rate into pH 7.5 Tris-HCl buffer solution was measured. Osteoconductivity was assessed by the release of calcium ions, and their ability to stimulate new bone formation was examined through reconstruction of rabbit distal femur bone defects. It was found that the apatite coating resulted in increased osteoconduction and a decreased dissolution rate compared with bare CSD granules. When rabbit distal femur bone defect was reconstructed with Ap/CSD, CSD and sintered hydroxyapatite (s-HAp), all samples demonstrated an excellent tissue response. Four weeks after surgery, a higher radio opacity was obtained for Ap/CSD when compared with CSD, indicating new bone formation. The s-HAp granules remained and thus, new bone formation was smallest even though s-HAp granules bonded with the bone. Ap/CSD that was fabricated at 60 °C induced greater bone formation than CSD. It is therefore concluded that Ap/CSD has good potential value as a bone augmentation material.","Tsuchiya, Akira;Sato, Marino;Takahashi, Ichiro;Ishikawa, Kunio",2018-11-30,Ceramics International,"Bone augmentation material,CaSO4,Apatite,Dissolution rate",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.021
Improving tribological performance of chemically bonded phosphate ceramic coatings reinforced by graphene nano-platelets,"To improve tribological performance of chemically bonded phosphate ceramic coatings, the graphene nano-platelets (GNPs) were selected as the reinforcement. Tribological experiment and the analysis of SEM, EDS and Raman were conducted to clarify the mechanism of graphene on the improvement of tribological performance. It was found that, the worn surface of the coating with GNPs is smoother than the one without GNPs, and these GNPs were extruded out and adhered to the worn surface forming the lubricating tribofilm. Besides, the wear volume decreases with the introduction of GNPs. The reason behind this is that these GNPs can lead to the absorption of the fracture energy, which further can improve the mechanical property of the ceramic. This improvement makes the ceramic more tolerant to damage during the wear. Additionally, the decrease of the internal stress of contact surface because of the large contact surface induced by the smooth worn surface results in the lower wear. The friction coefficient shows the similar trends with the wear volume. The lubricant effect of the adhered lubricating tribofilm stemming from the weak interfacial shear strength between graphene platelets dominantly leads to the decrease in friction coefficient. Besides, the smaller internal stress induced by the smooth surface also contributes to the low friction coefficient because of the direct proportionality between the interfacial shear strength and the contact pressure.","Bian, Da;Aradhyula, Thirumala Vasu;Guo, Yongxin;Zhao, Yongwu",2017-10-15,Ceramics International,"Graphene nano-platelets,Chemically bonded phosphate ceramic coatings,Wear,Friction coefficient",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.116,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.06.116
"Phase-structures, thermophysical properties of Sm3Ce7Ta2O23.5 and Gd3Ce7Ta2O23.5 oxides for thermal barrier coating applications","Two types of rare earth tantalite oxides, Sm3Ce7Ta2O23.5 and Gd3Ce7Ta2O23.5, were synthesised using a high-temperature sintering technique. The phase-structures, micro-morphologies, element compositions, thermal conductivities, and thermal expansion performances were investigated. The final conclusions show that these two ceramics are approximately composed of 2RETa0.5Ce2.5O8.25 and RETaCe2O7. The relative densities are above 90%, and the interfaces between grains are clear. Owing to the relatively high total atomic weights, complicated element compositions, and many more oxygen vacancies, the obtained oxides exhibit lower thermal conductivities than RE2Zr2O7 and YSZ. The coefficients of thermal expansion for Sm3Ce7Ta2O23.5 and Gd3Ce7Ta2O23.5 above 1473 K are greater than those of La2Zr2O7 and YSZ.

Seed-assisted thermal growth of one-dimensional TiO2 nanomaterials on carbon fibers,"One-dimensional (1D) TiO2 nanomaterials (NMs), including TiO2 nanowires (NWs) and TiO2 nanorods (NRs), grown on carbon fibers (CFs) were successfully prepared by a seed-assisted thermal growth method, involving “pre-coating” and “growth” processes. The as-obtained CFs with TiO2-NWs (CFs/TiO2-NWs) and CFs with TiO2-NRs (CFs/TiO2-NRs) were characterized with a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS), and X-ray diffractometer (XRD). Additionally, the photocatalytic activities of CFs/TiO2-NWs and CFs/TiO2-NRs were evaluated by degrading methylene blue (MB) under UV–vis irradiation. The images on FESEM and TEM show that the entire surfaces of CFs are covered with vertically aligned 1D TiO2 NMs. The analyses with XPS and XRD indicate that TiO2-NWs and TiO2-NRs are pure rutile TiO2. MB conversions over CFs/TiO2-NWs (98.6%) and CFs/TiO2-NRs (96.0%) are significantly higher than those over CFs (5.6%) and CFs/TiO2-seed layer (28.4%), implying that the 1D TiO2 NMs covered on CFs can change the micro-structure of CFs and provide more photocatalytically active sites. The photostability tests of CFs/TiO2-NWs and CFs/TiO2-NRs indicate that they are reusable due to the good immobilization of 1D TiO2 NMs on CFs. This work provides an intriguing method for growing 1D TiO2 NMs on flexible substrates.","Sun, Yin-Yu;Zong, Zhi-Min;Li, Zhan-Ku;Zhao, Yun-Peng;Wei, Xian-Yong",2017-02-15,Ceramics International,"Seed-assisted thermal growth,Carbon fibers,TiO2 nanomaterials,Photocatalytic activity",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.11.138,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.11.138
High dielectric tunability in composites prepared using SiO2 coated Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3 nanoparticles,"Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3 (BST) nanoparticles were coated with SiO2 using a chemical process. SiO2-coated BST was used as the starting material to prepare BST-xSiO2 (x = 0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 wt%) composites via a conventional ceramic process. The influence of SiO2 on the structure and properties of these composites was systematically studied. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results showed that the porosity of the composites was obviously reduced by the addition of SiO2. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicated that, besides the perovskite phase of BST, a traceable secondary phase of BaTiSiO5 also existed. The formation of BaTiSiO5 was due to the reaction between SiO2 and barium from BST. This resulted in a lower phase transition temperature of BST phase in the composites. It was found that the dielectric constant and loss decreased with increasing SiO2 content. All the composites exhibited a low dielectric loss (< 0.01) and an almost frequency independent dielectric constant in a frequency range from 100 Hz to 100 kHz. All the composites exhibited a high tunability (> 47%). Although the tunability decreased with increasing SiO2 content, a higher tunability was achieved in the composites because the composites exhibited a much higher breakdown strength than the pure BST ceramics. Additionally, it was found that the tunability of the composites increased with the decrease of the operating temperature.","Lu, Xu;Tong, Yang;Zhang, Lin;Ma, Baisheng;Cheng, Z.-Y.",2018-06-01,Ceramics International,"Nanoparticle,Chemical coating,Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3-SiO2 composite,Dielectric tunability",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.235,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.235

The in-vitro behavior, changes in solution pH as well as the amount of evolved hydrogen of these coatings were also evaluated during five days immersion in SBF. The results indicated that the pulse deposited HA having 1% CNTs coating was the optimum condition which decreased the corrosion current density of AZ31 magnesium alloy from 44.25 µA/cm2 to 0.72 µA/cm2. Moreover, it stabilized the alkalization behavior of AZ31 alloy and caused a tenfold decrease in the amount of hydrogen generation in SBF. Additionally, the formation of new hydroxyapatite layer on the surface of the pre-exist coatings after five days immersion in SBF was confirmed by SEM characterization.","Khazeni, D.;Saremi, M.;Soltani, R.",2019-06-15,Ceramics International,"Magnesium alloy,Electrodeposition,Hydroxyapatite,Carbon nanotube,Corrosion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.105,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.105
Microstructural evolution of multi-walled carbon nanotubes in the presence of mixture of silicon and silica powders at high temperatures,"Microstructural evolution of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in the presence of mixture of silicon and silica powders in a coke bed is studied in the temperature range of 1000–1500°C by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and thermogravimetry–differential scanning calorimetry (TG–DSC). The results showed that a thin amorphous SiO2 coating was formed on the surface of MWCNTs at the temperature below 1300°C. With the increase of the treated temperature, the coating became thicker, 3–7nm in thickness at 1400°C and a maximum of 10nm at 1500°C. Meanwhile, SiC nanowires and SiC nanocrystals around Ni catalyst at the tip of MWCNTs were formed at 1400°C and 1500°C, which were related to the vapor–vapor (V–V) and vapor–liquid–solid (V–L–S) reactions between SiO (g) and CO (g) or C (s), respectively. The oxidation resistance of all the treated MWCNTs was better than that of as-received ones. The oxidation peak temperature reached 804.2°C for the treated MWCNTs, much higher than 652.2°C for as-received ones.","Li, Yawei;Luo, Ming;Jin, Shengli;Sang, Shaobai;Zhao, Lei",2012-07-31,Ceramics International,"SiC,MWCNTs,Evolution,SiO2 coating,Oxidation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.01.068,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.01.068
Preparation and properties of SiC fibre reinforced SiAION ceramic composite,"Polymer-derived SiC fibre (Nicalon)/SiAlON(Si3Al3O3N5)-matrix composite was fabricated by a filament-winding technique, followed by hot-pressing at 1350 °C. SiC fibres with and without carbon coating were used and the effect of carbon coating on the composite properties was investigated. The composite reinforced with non-coated SiC fibre indicated improved bending strength (600 MPa) and apparent fracture toughness (12.8 MPam0.5) compared with those of monolithic SiAlON (389 MPa, 3.6 MPam0.5), while the composite with carbon-coated fibre showed delamination fracture. The composites with non-coated and carbon-coated fibres both exhibited a remarkably higher fracture energy (9.8 kJ/m2 and 11.1 kJ/m2, respectively) than that of monolithic SiAlON (0.1 kJ/m2).","Ueno, Kazuo;Inoue, Takahiro",1997-12-31,Ceramics International, ,10.1016/S0272-8842(96)00018-1,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0272-8842(96)00018-1
"Microwave-hydrothermal/solvothermal synthesis of kesterite, an emerging photovoltaic material","Rapid synthesis of kesterite (Cu2ZnSnS4), an emerging photovoltaic material was achieved by microwave-hydrothermal/solvothermal (M-H/S) process. Conventional-hydrothermal (C-H) process was also used for comparison with M-H/S process. The synthesized kesterite samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron diffraction and UV–vis spectroscopy. Nanophase kesterite, which is potentially suitable for coating was synthesized in ethylene glycol.

Performance of lightweight coated oxide ceramic composites for industrial high speed wood cutting tools: A step closer to market,"The introduction of lightweight cutting tips in industrial wood machining could lead to machining at much higher speeds and thus greatly increase efficiency. One possible way to achieve this is through lightweight ceramic composites. An Al2O3 ceramic matrix was selected and reinforced with particles resulting in a density of approximately one quarter of the currently used heavy tungsten carbide tools (density of >15g/cm3). Furthermore, a coating was applied to the ceramic cutting tools in order to increase the stability of the cutting edge. A combination of reduced coefficient of friction, frictional forces and a resulting decrease in temperature can lead to a reduction in chipping at the cutting tip. Chipping has always been the major drawback of ceramic cutting tools for industrial wood cutting. A ceramic composite containing 25vol% of submicron and nano sized SiC particles shows good mechanical properties with HV2=21.5GPa and KIc=4.5MPam1/2. This composition performed very well in industrial cutting trials on laminated beech. The cutting performance was increased further by use of an industrially available coating on the tools. The quality of the cut wood surface has always been difficult to characterize when comparing cutting tool materials and is often performed qualitatively by experienced carpenters by touch. The surface quality of the machined laminated beech was for the first time quantitatively characterized using Gelsight 2.5D tactile sensing.","Blugan, Gurdial;Strehler, Claudia;Vetterli, Marc;Ehrle, Bruno;Duttlinger, Roland;Blösch, Peter;Kuebler, Jakob",2017-08-15,Ceramics International,"Al2O3 (D),Composites (B),Cutting tools (E),Wood machining",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.005
Bead-like Co-doped ZnO with improved microwave absorption properties,"Based on the superior semiconducting and dielectric properties of traditional ZnO microwave absorbers, we report a significant enhancement of microwave absorption performance using a bead-like Co doping technique with an optimized morphology, fewer functional defects and multiple electromagnetic loss mechanisms. The bead-like ZnO is prepared by electrospinning and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and vector network analyzer (VNA). The results show that the phase composition of ZnO is not changed, but lattice shrinkage and defects are caused by the Co doping. The as-prepared Co-doped ZnO exhibits ferromagnetic properties and excellent electromagnetic loss performance. The dielectric loss is caused by interfacial polarization and dipole polarization. The magnetic loss is derived from magnetic hysteresis loss and residual loss. The optimal microwave absorption properties are obtained when the Co doping content is x = 0.09. The effective microwave absorption bandwidth with reflection loss less than − 10 dB can reach 11.6 GHz (6.4–18 GHz) at a coating thickness of 1.0–4.0 mm. This study demonstrates a promising method to improve the microwave absorption properties of ZnO.","Huang, Xiaogu;Zhang, Mingji;Qin, Yushuang;Chen, Yunyun",2019-04-15,Ceramics International,"Zinc oxide,Semiconductor,Electromagnetic loss,Microwave absorption",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.084,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.084
Preparation and characterization of Mg2+-doped CaCu3Ti4O12 pigment with high NIR reflectance,"A new inorganic pigment CaCu3-xMgxTi4O12 (x = 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6) with high reflectance at the near-infrared (NIR) band was synthesized by the traditional solid-phase method. The substitution of Mg2+ for Cu2+ in CaCu3Ti4O12 increased the band gap of pigments from 2.04 eV to 2.11 eV. This change was attributed to the charge transfer of O2p to Ti3d, which resulted in the color change of powder pigment samples from orange to yellow. The thermal performance of the corresponding pigmented coating was evaluated. Results showed that the NIR solar reflectance of the aluminum plate coated with CaCu3-xMgxTi4O12 (x = 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6) pigment reached as high as 48.5%–53.9%. CaCu2.6Mg0.4Ti4O12 was coated as a roof material of a building on the metal surface to determine differences in indoor temperature, and its thermal insulation effect was remarkable. Therefore, these CaCu3-xMgxTi4O12 powders have great potential in serving as cool pigments for building coatings.","Xu, Zhicheng;Wang, Da;Zhong, Mingfeng;Zhang, Zhijie",2020-11-30,Ceramics International,"Cool colored coating,Mg-doped CCTO,NIR reflectance,Solar reflectance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.324,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.324
Fabrication of thick YSZ thermal barrier coatings using electrophoretic deposition,"Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) is a cheaper and more flexible method in the application of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) compared with the conventional coating techniques, e.g. air-plasma-spray (APS) and electron beam physical vapour deposition (EBPVD). However, the EPD coating thickness tends to be restricted to a critical value (about 100μm), which becomes its major concern as normally 200–400μm thickness is required for an effective thermal protection. In this study, the thickness restriction had been overcome by (1) using large-size particles for EPD; (2) adding 1–2mol% Fe2O3 as sintering aid; and (3) applying a gradient voltage to counterbalance the increasing resistance of the non-conductive deposits. These techniques enabled the fabrication of uniform and crack-free YSZ top-coat with a thickness of 300–400μm by EPD. Compared with the APS coatings, the EPD coatings possess more favourable microstructure with uniformly distributed porosity and stronger bonding at the substrate/coating interface.","Bai, Mingwen;Guo, Fangwei;Xiao, Ping",2014-12-31,Ceramics International,"Electrophoretic deposition (EPD),Critical crack thickness (CCT),Y2O3-stabilized-ZrO2 (YSZ),Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs)",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.08.021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.08.021
Novel synthesis and applications of yttrium silicates from a silicone resin containing oxide nano-particle fillers,"In this paper, a novel method for the synthesis of yttrium silicates is presented. Such silicates are well known to be promising materials for protecting various substrates against high temperature oxidation, but they can typically be produced only after quite complicated processing. The use of preceramic polymers, in which a silicate article is obtained by direct thermal treatment in air of nano-composites consisting of silicone resins containing suitable oxide nano-particles, is a valid alternative, since the desired phases, i.e. Y-monosilicate (Y2O3·SiO2) and Y-disilicate (Y2O3·2SiO2) can be obtained by treatments at low temperature (1000–1400°C). Y-disilicate could be employed for the manufacturing of dense and thick coatings on SiC foamed substrate, by simply dipping the substrates into silicone suspensions, before ceramic conversion. Y-monosilicate, that could be also useful for coatings, was found to exhibit promising characteristics, when doped with Eu2O3, making it of interest for application as red phosphor for LEDs.","Bernardo, Enrico;Parcianello, Giulio;Colombo, Paolo",2012-09-30,Ceramics International,"B.

Development and characterization of silver and zinc doped bioceramic layer on metallic implant materials for orthopedic application,"A successful electrodeposition method for preparing silver and zinc modified bioactive calcium phosphate layers onto surgical grade titanium alloy material (Ti6Al4V) was developed. The coatings were deposited on the Ti6Al4V surface by pulse current at 70°C from an electrolyte containing adequate amounts of calcium nitrate, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, zinc nitrate and silver nitrate. The corrosion resistivity of the bioceramic coatings was assessed in conventional Ringer׳s solution in a three electrode open cell by potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The results revealed the pure bioactive calcium phosphate (CaP) coated implant materials to possess the highest resistivity to corrosion, while the silver and zinc doped CaP layer showed at least one order of magnitude lower corrosion resistance. These modified CaP coatings can be further considered as antimicrobial coatings with enhanced biocompatibility. The morphology and structure of the coatings were characterized by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy-dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) that confirmed the pulse current deposited CaP layer to consist of a mixture of different calcium phosphate phases such as hydroxyapatite (HAp), monetite (dicalcium phosphate, CaHPO4) as well as other Ca-containing components, portlandite (Ca(OH)2) and parascholzite (CaZn2(PO4)2(H2O)2).","Furko, Monika;Jiang, Yunhong;Wilkins, Terry;Balázsi, Csaba",2016-03-31,Ceramics International,"Bioceramic layer,Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy,Implant materials,Hydroxyapatite",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.12.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.12.006
Temperature-dependent growth of ZnO structures by thermal oxidation of Zn coatings electrodeposited on steel substrates and their photocatalytic activities,"In this work, zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructures were successfully synthesized by thermal oxidation of zinc (Zn) coated steel substrates. Zn coatings were electrodeposited on the mild carbon steel sheet in the sulfate bath by DC current. The zinc coated samples were oxidized in air at distinct annealing temperatures between 400°C and 800°C. The phase structure and surface morphology of the ZnO films were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The photocatalytic activity of these ZnO layers was examined by means of decomposition of methylene blue (MB) aqueous solutions under UV lamp irradiation for various duration. The findings illustrated that annealing temperatures had a big effect on the morphology and structure of the ZnO layers. The annealed layers showed significantly enhanced photoactivity activity than the pure Zn layer under UV-irradiation. The sample with ZnO nanostructures oxidized at 800°C exhibited a better photocatalytic degradation of MB than the other samples. This paper can provide an important contribution to the development of efficient photocatalysts for the solution of the environmental pollution problems.","Dikici, Tuncay",2017-08-01,Ceramics International,"Zinc oxide,Photocatalytic performance,Surface morphology,Thermal oxidation,Methylene blue",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.162,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.162
Enhanced electrochemical performance of Ag-coated CuCr2O4 as anode material for lithium-ion batteries,"CuCr2O4/Ag is prepared by a preliminary sol-gel formation of CuCr2O4 and a subsequent chemical deposition of Ag on the surface by electroless plating. The surface morphology, structure and electrochemical behaviors of CuCr2O4/Ag and CuCr2O4 are observed and compared by various analytical techniques. It is obvious that the electrochemical property of CuCr2O4 is enhanced by Ag coating layer. The as-prepared CuCr2O4/Ag composite shows an initial discharge specific capacity of 495.6mAhg−1, and its coulombic efficiency evolves from 27.7% to 97.8% in the initial 40 cycles. In contrast, the initial discharge specific capacity and coulombic efficiency of CuCr2O4 are 372.8mAhg−1 and 21.7%, respectively. During the following 40 cycles, the cycling coulombic efficiency for CuCr2O4 is merely 94.3%. Besides, the reversible charge capacity of CuCr2O4/Ag is 133.9mAhg−1 after 40 cycles. For comparison, the reversible lithium storage capacity of bare CuCr2O4 is only 100.5mAhg−1. It suggests that the improved reversible capacity and cycling performance should be ascribed to the Ag coating layer, which improves the electronic conductivity of CuCr2O4 and may suppress the volume change of CuCr2O4 particles during repeated cycles.","Lao, Mengmeng;Shu, Jie;Shao, Lianyi;Lin, Xiaoting;Wu, Kaiqiang;Shui, Miao;Li, Peng;Long, Nengbing;Ren, Yuanlong",2014-09-30,Ceramics International,"A.

Microstructure and mechanical property of dense yttria-stabilized zirconia coating fabricated by an axial bi-cathode plasma torch under very low pressure,"Very low-pressure plasma spray is a promising technique for preparing dense metal/ceramic coatings due to the high-speed plasma jet. However, at the same time, the low-pressure environment weakens the ability of the plasma jet to heat sprayed materials. In order to improve this shortcoming, a novel bi-cathode plasma torch was firstly designed in this study, which could enhance the plasma power from 40 kW to 81 kW and realize the axial powder feeding. By using this torch under 6 mbar, a dense and uniform yttria-stabilized zirconia coating with a porosity of 2.7% was fabricated, which had a hybrid microstructure that deposited with the form of unmelted particles, melted droplets, and vapor clusters. Meanwhile, 40% of the zirconia phase changed from the monoclinic type to the tetragonal type, indicating that the yttria-stabilized zirconia powder was melted well. The microhardness and elastic modulus of the coating was high compared with those prepared with other plasma spraying processes, which was 11.7 ± 0.6 GPa and 167.8 ± 4 GPa, respectively. The high density and mechanical property of the YSZ coating demonstrated that using the bi-cathode plasma torch at low pressure has the potential for the preparation of SOFC electrolytes.","Song, Chen;Wang, Yan;Fan, Xiu-juan;Xie, Shi-ming;Liu, Min;Zhou, Ke-song;Deng, Chun-ming;Deng, Chang-guang;Liao, Han-lin",2020-05-31,Ceramics International,"Dense yttria-stabilized zirconia coating,Axial plasma torch,Very low-pressure plasma spray,Microstructure,Mechanical property",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.212,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.212
Al-doping induced superior lithium ion storage capability of LiNiO2 spheres,"To optimize the performance of LiNiO2 with minimal modification of the pristine structure, a facile solid-state approach, based on the interdiffusion of elements at the solid/solid interface, is developed to achieve uniformly Al-doped LiNiO2 using alumina coated Ni(OH)2 spheres as the precursor. The resulting LiNi0.95Al0.05O2 material exhibits excellent discharge capacity (209.9 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C) and cycling stability with a capacity retention of 85.10% after 200 cycles at 0.5 C. This is ascribed to the improved reversibility of the phase transitions by Al-doping as revealed by in-situ XRD characterization. The Al-doping also endows the material with superior rate capability due to the enlarged interlayer spacing in the structure and alleviation of the side reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface, favorable for lithium ion diffusion. An optimal amount of doped Al is necessary for ensuring the structure stability and interface ionic conductivity of the LiNiO2 spheres. Thus, the present strategy may provide an opportunity to optimize the performance of LiNiO2, with uniform doping of a small amount of Al, producing a promising cathode material for advanced lithium ion batteries.","Cao, Haishang;Du, Fanghui;Adkins, Jason;Zhou, Qun;Dai, Hui;Sun, Pengpeng;Hu, Die;Zheng, Junwei",2020-08-15,Ceramics International,"Lithium nickelate,Aluminum doping,Surface coating,Interdiffusion,Lithium ion battery",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.078,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.078
"Deformation and rupture behaviors of SiC/SiC under creep, fatigue and dwell-fatigue load at 1300 °C","High temperature creep and fatigue properties are important characteristics of SiC/SiC composites. In this work, dwell-fatigue tests were conducted at 1300 °C for 3D-braided SiC/SiC with and without coatings, and experimental results of dwell-fatigue tests were analyzed together with results of fatigue and creep tests. Then, general quantitative method was adopted to explain the deformation and rupture behaviors of SiC/SiC in creep, fatigue and dwell-fatigue tests. Micromechanical creep model could effectively simulate deformation behavior when the maximum load was under matrix cracking stress. Stress transfer behavior of constituents during creep and fatigue tests provided insights into the difference in macro time/cycle dependent deformation. Next, by incorporating damage evolution model which represents oxidation assisted unbridged crack growth, deformation acceleration in tertiary stage of creep was successfully simulated. Finally, SiC/SiC lifetimes under all fatigue, creep, and dwell-fatigue loads were predicted considering matrix crack propagation and fiber strength degradation. Simulated results correlated well with experimental data, verifying the effectiveness of micromechanical model to predict the creep and fatigue behaviors of SiC/SiC composites at high temperatures.","Jing, Xin;Cheng, Zhen;Niu, Hongwei;Yang, Xiaoguang;Shi, Duoqi",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"SiC/SiC,Fatigue,Creep,Micromechanical model,Damage evolution,Life prediction",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.134,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.134
Fabrication and thermal shock resistance of β-Si3N4-based environmental barrier coating on porous Si3N4 ceramic,"A dense β-Si3N4-based waterproof environmental barrier coating was fabricated using the liquid infiltration and filling method on porous Si3N4 ceramic. Microstructure and thermal shock resistance of the coating were investigated. The results showed that the coating consisted of β-Si3N4, Y10Al2Si3O18N4 and Y-Si-Al-O glass. As-prepared coating exhibited excellent thermal shock resistance. During thermal shock at ∆T=1200°C, cracks were formed within the coating, but they did not penetrate through the whole coating due to the toughening mechanisms of the coating, including β-Si3N4 particle bridging and crack branching. In addition, the coating had a good crack self-sealing ability during thermal cycling, which is mainly attributed to glass flow and oxidation of β-Si3N4 particles within the crack. After thermal cycling for 25 times, the coating still had a good waterproof ability, and the water absorption of the coated porous Si3N4 sample increased slightly from 4.5% to 9.3%.","Wang, Chao;Wang, Hongjie;Qiao, Ruiqing;Zhang, Chunhua;Chen, Lijia",2016-09-30,Ceramics International,"Porous Si3 N 4 ceramic,Β-Si3N4-based coating,Water absorption,Thermal shock resistance,Crack self-sealing",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.031,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.031
Optical properties and thermal durability of copper cobalt oxide thin film coatings with integrated silica antireflection layer,"Copper cobalt oxide (Cu2CoO3) thin film coatings integrated with silica (SiO2) antireflection (AR) layer have been deposited on the top of aluminum substrates using a simple sol–gel dip-coating method. Reflectance spectra of the coatings were generated using spectroscopic methods while the coatings were subjected to an accelerated thermal durability test. The addition of silica changed the reflectance spectra of coatings within the wavelength range of 0.3–15.4µm. The absorptance decreased with the increase of the withdrawal rate in range of 10–40mm/min, while the emittance increased with the increase of the withdrawal rate. The optimum optical parameters for this study were absorptance, α S =84.96%; emittance, ε T =5.63% corresponding to the coating with a silica AR layer at withdrawal rate of 10mm/min. The coatings with the silica AR layer were shown to be thermally durable in which no discernible ‘cracking’ phenomenon was observed. The degradation of the coatings with the silica AR layer was predominantly governed by temperature changes rather than exposure time.","Amri, Amun;Jiang, Zhong-Tao;Wyatt, Nick;Yin, Chun-Yang;Mondinos, Nicholas;Pryor, Trevor;Rahman, M.

Effect of Al2O3 on the densification and oxidation behavior of SiC coating for carbon/carbon composites,"A silicon carbide (SiC) coating was prepared on carbon/carbon (C/C) composites by pack cementation using Si, C and Al2O3 powers as raw materials. The role of Al2O3 on the densification of the SiC coating was investigated. The results show that the densification and thickness of the SiC coating obviously increase with the increase of Al2O3 content, which is attributed to the enhanced material transport through liquid Al2O3 at high temperature. Moreover, to study the effect of Al2O3 on the oxidation behavior of SiC coating itself at 1773 K in air, the synthetic SiC powders by pack cementation were sintered. The results present that after oxidation for 40 h, only a few holes are observed in the generated glass layer of the SiC ceramic without Al2O3, while more holes appear in the surface of the oxidized Al2O3 doped SiC ceramic, owning to the doped Al atom destroying the SiO2 network and causing the permeability of oxygen to increase.","Cheng, Chunyu;Li, Hejun;Fu, Qiangang;Guo, Liping",2018-08-01,Ceramics International,"Al2O3-SiC coating,Microstructure,Oxidation,First-principle calculation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.072,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.072
Long-term corrosion resistance and fast mineralization behavior of micro-nano hydroxyapatite coated magnesium alloy in vitro,"To improve the long-term corrosion resistance of biodegradable AZ31 magnesium alloy, the micro-nano structural hydroxyapatite (HA) coating was fabricated on AZ31 substrate by hydrothermal treatment. The compact and high crystallinity HA coating prepared at 120 °C had excellent electrochemical properties. Moreover, the cell viability experiment revealed that the micro-nano structure coating was conducive to the viability and proliferation of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. The immersion experiment in simulated body fluid (SBF) solution showed that the micro-nano structural HA coatings could quickly induce the production of HA mineralization, and then the mineralization evolved into a compact mineralized layer on the surface of coated sample, which provided a long-term protection for the specimen. Even after 147 days of immersion, the coated samples remained the relatively complete macroscopic shape, the corrosion rates were lower than 0.500 mm/y and the pH values of the SBF solution maintained in the range of 7.10–7.80, suggesting when these coated AZ31 magnesium alloys were used as degradable biomaterial implants, they could provide a long-term mechanical support during the healing of damaged bones.","Sun, Jiayue;Cai, Shu;Wei, Jieling;Shen, Kai'er;Ling, Rui;Sun, Jin'e;Liu, Jia;Xu, Guohua",2020-01-31,Ceramics International,"Magnesium alloy,Micro-nano structure,Mineralization,Long-term corrosion resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.038,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.038
Facile synthesis of NiCo2O4/rGO microspheres with high-performance for supercapacitor,"NiCo2O4/rGO microspheres were synthesized by a hydrothermal reaction followed by a spray drying process. The existence of a rGO coating layer was responsible for a conductivity improvement and fast charge transport kinetics. Furthermore, an elastic matrix of rGO reinforced the structure stability and accommodated the volume expansion of the NiCo2O4 particles. Based on the above advantages, the NiCo2O4/rGO presented excellent electrochemical performance, such as an impressive specific capacitance (702 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1) and notable cycling stability, maintaining 98.3% of the initial specific capacitance after 10000 charge-discharge cycles at 0.5 A g−1. This simplified method is not only potentially beneficial for spinel-type hybrid electrode materials but also potentially suitable for mass production.","Meng, Fanbin;Zhao, Lican;Zhang, Yujie;Zhai, Jiao;Li, Yujin;Zhang, Wei",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Ferrites,Electrical properties,Capacitors,Graphene",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.085,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.085
"Effect of pore-forming agent quantity on pore structure, phase composition, micro-hardness of gradient bioceramic coatings under optimal laser process parameters","Titanium-based gradient bioceramic coating fabricated by laser cladding has been studied due to its excellent comprehensive performance and potential value in biomaterials. However, pore sizes of the coating prepared using traditional laser cladding technique are typically too small which can reduce its osteogenesis performance. To address this issue, a porous gradient bioceramic coating is successfully prepared on a titanium alloy surface by adding a pore-forming agent to the coating powder with subsequent laser cladding process. The bioceramic coating prepared with the optimized processing conditions (output power P = 1.8 kW, scanning speed V = 240 mm/min, and spot diameter D = 4 mm) exhibits a flat surface that comprises of a uniform enamel microstructure. The coating is metallurgically bonded to the substrate with a low number of microcracks. When the amount of pore-forming agent A = 2.5 wt%, the distribution of pores in coating becomes more uniform. When A = 2.5 to 10 wt%, the most probable pore size is 2.5 μm. It is shown that pore-forming agent quantity A = 2.5 wt% has a significant advantage in producing more large-sized pores in the coating. The number of pores in coating shows a trend of decreasing first, then increasing, and then decreasing. The coating phase consists of HA, β-TCP, TiO2, CaTiO3, etc., which is consistent with the coating material without pore-forming agent. In general, microhardness gradually decreases with increasing pore-forming agent quantity. The maximum microhardness values of coatings with and without pore-forming agent are 976 HV0.2 and 2086 HV0.2, respectively. Therefore, with the addition of a suitable amount of pore-forming agent, a porous bioceramic coating can be fabricated by an optimized laser cladding technique. This porous morphology will be beneficial for improving the osteogenic properties of the coating.","Gu, Huaizhang;Fu, Qi;Sheng, Bo;Cai, Enpei;Tang, Geng;Liu, Qibin",2020-06-01,Ceramics International,"Laser cladding,Pore-forming agent,Pore structure,Coating,Osteogenesis",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.153,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.153
Insulator-conductor transition in carbon nanotube and graphene nanoplatelates reinforced plasma sprayed alumina single splat: Experimental evidence by conductive atomic force microscopy,"Splats are the most fundamental and paramount unit of any plasma sprayed coating and splats are having the potential to manipulate the overall property of the same. Current study shows the insulator-conductor transition of alumina (Al2O3) splat by the hybrid addition of carbonaceous nanofillers, namely carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and Graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) into it. Reinforcement of CNTs and GNPs changed the splat shape from fragmented to nearly disk shaped as well as from porous splat to densified one upon the reinforcement. Further, Current mapping over the splats were carried out using conductive atomic force microscopy (cAFM). Current map for Al2O3 splat showed fully black region, evincing its insulating nature; whereas hybrid addition of CNTs and GNPs into the splat dramatically improved the electrical conductivity of Al2O3 splat, coining its non-conductive map to conductive one. This transition was attributed to electron tunneling mechanism, which is a function of electron hopping distance of these conductive nanofillers. The electron hopping distance of the matrix got minimized when CNTs and GNPs were simultaneously added to Al2O3 splat, due to their higher aspect ratio. This led to the formation of a 3-dimensional conductive channels for the electron transport in the matrix, converting the whole splat as conductive.","Pandey, Krishna Kant;Singh, Ravi Kumar;Rahman, OS Asiq;Choudhary, Sumit;Verma, Rahul;Keshri, Anup Kumar",2020-10-15,Ceramics International,"Plasma spraying,Coating,Carbon,Electrical conductivity,Conductive atomic force microscopy",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.243,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.243
Tension-tension fatigue behavior of a PIP SiC/SiC composite at elevated temperature in air,"The tension–tension fatigue behavior of a PIP Silicon Carbide/Silicon Carbide (SiC/SiC) composite was investigated at 1300°C in air. The composite consisted of a new precursor polymer (LPVCS) pyrolyzed SiC matrix reinforced with pyrolytic carbon (PyC) coated 3D braided KD-I SiC fibers. Environmental barrier coatings (EBC) were employed to enhance the durability and air oxidation resistance of the composite at high temperature. Tension–tension fatigue tests were conducted at 1300°C in laboratory air at frequency of 1Hz. The ratio of minimum stress to maximum stress was 0.1, with maximum stresses ranging from 40 to 120MPa. Fatigue run-out was defined as 105 cycles. Strain accumulation with cycles and modulus evolution with cycles were analyzed for each fatigue test. Fatigue limit of SiC/SiC composite with EBC was 60MPa which was slightly higher than that without EBC. The microstructure as well as damage and failure mechanisms of the composites were investigated.","Luo, Zheng;Cao, He;Ren, Hu;Zhou, Xingui",2016-02-01,Ceramics International,"C.

The effect of surface treatment on CaP deposition of Ti6Al4V open cell foams in SBF solution,"The effects of alkali and nitric acid surface treatment and acid etching on the CaP deposition of an open cell Ti6Al4V foam (60% porous and 300–500μm in pore size) developed for biomedical applications were investigated in a simulated body fluid (SBF) solution for 14-day. The surface roughness of the foam specimens ground flat surfaces was measured in nano-metric scale before and after SBF immersion using an atomic force microscope (AFM). A significant increase in the surface roughness of alkali treated foam specimen after SBF immersion indicated a smaller crystal size CaP deposition, which was also confirmed by the AFM micrographs. The microscopic evaluation clearly showed that alkali treatment and nitric acid treatment induced a continuous, uniform CaP deposition on the cell wall surfaces of the foam (interior of cells). While in untreated foam specimen the cells are filled with CaP precipitates and acid etching did not produce a continuous coating layer on particles interior of the cells. The coating layer thickness was ∼3μm in alkali treated foam specimens after 14-day of SBF immersion, while nitric acid treatment induced relatively thinner coating layer, 0.6μm.","Turkan, Ugur;Guden, Mustafa",2010-08-31,Ceramics International,"A.

Low leakage current of CdSe quantum dots/Si composite structure and its performance for photodiode and solar cell,"The CdSe quantum dots were deposited on p type Si(100) substrate by spin coating process. CdSe quantum dots were selected as the interlayer to reduce the reverse-bias leakage current of heterojunction. Various junction parameters were determined from the current-voltage (I–V) and capacitance-voltage (C–V) characteristics. Au/CdSe quantum dots/p-Si structure exhibits a fairly low leakage current density of 4.54×10−9 A/cm2 and a high rectification ratio of 3.1×106 at applied electric field of ±4V. Furthermore, I-V characteristics under illumination show strong photovoltaic (PV) behavior. These results are attributed to the low interfacial state density and defect density due to CdSe quantum dots at the interface. It is also evaluated that the Au/CdSe quantum dots/p-Si structure can be a potential candidate for photodiode and solar cell applications.","Soylu, M.;Al-Ghamdi, Ahmed.

Influence of material parameters on the interfacial crack growth in thermal barrier coating system,"Surface crack failure and interfacial crack failure are typical failure modes in thermal barrier coating (TBC) system. The most common failure form is the peeling of top coat (TC) caused by interfacial crack. In this study, the influence of material parameter on the energy release rate of interfacial crack in TBC system was studied by extended finite element method. The influence of the elastic modulus of TC and the elastic modulus of bond coat (BC) was considered, and the effect of the crack position and length was also taken into account. The results show that the value of the energy release rate at TC/thermally grown oxide (TGO) and TGO/BC interfaces increases with the increase of the elastic modulus of TC, and the increase rate increases with the increase of crack length. With the increase of crack length, the value of the energy release rate and the increase rate increase. With the increase of the elastic modulus of BC, the influence of the shorter cracks at TC/TGO interface decreases, while for the longer cracks, the value of the energy release rate decreases with the increase of the elastic modulus of BC, and the decrease rate of the energy release rate decreases with the elastic modulus of BC increasing. For TGO/BC interface crack, the value of the energy release rate gradually decreases with the increase of the elastic modulus of BC, and the longer the crack length is, the more obvious the influence is. Both the elastic moduli of TC and BC have more influence on TC/TGO interfacial cracks than on TGO/BC interfacial cracks.","Hui, Meiting;Yu, Qingmin;Shi, Yongzhi",2019-05-31,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings,Interfacial crack,Energy release rate,Extended finite element",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.150,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.150
Effect of Na+ and NaOH concentrations on the surface morphology and dissolution behavior of hydroxyapatite,"Hydroxyapatite coatings were fabricated by the electrochemical deposition method on carbon/carbon composites and were post-treated with different concentrations and pH values of boiling NaOH solution.

The coating structure and its surface morphologies were determined by x-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The concentration of Ca2+ was measured by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer. Results revealed that significant differences can be seen between the two hydroxyapatite coatings in the morphology and components. in the morphology and components between the two hydroxyapatite coatings.

Structure and properties of plasma sprayed BaTiO3 coatings: Spray parameters versus structure and photocatalytic activity,"Plasma spraying enables the creation of layers with thickness in a millimeter range adhering on various substrates. This paper provides a study of phase composition, optical properties and photocatalytic activity of BaTiO3 coatings prepared by atmospheric plasma spraying. The spraying was carried out by a direct current gas-stabilized plasma gun. BaTiO3 was fed into the plasma jet as a feedstock powder prepared by a reactive sintering of micrometer-sized powders of BaCO3 and TiO2. Microstructure and phase composition are reported and discussed in connection with optical properties and photocatalytic activity. The spraying was carried out by a direct current gas-stabilized plasma gun which normally utilizes spray distance (SD) in frames from 100 to 150mm. Besides conventional SD 100mm also extremely high SD 190mm was used. The color of the sprayed coating is different for each SD and also differs from sintered BaTiO3. X-ray diffraction and also SAD mode of HR-TEM show certain content of amorphous fraction in the coating. The hydrogen content in the coating was found to be higher in the coatings than in the sintered bulk. The diffuse reflectance was measured by UV–VIS spectrophotometry and corresponding band-gap energy was estimated. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms specific stoichiometric and structural disorder observed also at bang-gap evaluation and by Raman spectroscopy. HR-TEM images for crystalline and amorphous zones are given. Photocatalytic decomposition of acetone was tested and BaTiO3 coatings compared with a sintered bulk.","Ctibor, Pavel;Ageorges, Helene;Stengl, Vaclav;Murafa, Nataliya;Pis, Igor;Zahoranova, Tatiana;Nehasil, Vaclav;Pala, Zdenek",2011-09-30,Ceramics International,"B.

Synthesis and characterization of sol–gel derived calcium hydroxyapatite thin films spin-coated on silicon substrate,"The goal of this study was to demonstrate that sol–gel processing route is suitable for the fabrication of calcium hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, CHA) thin films on Si substrate by spin-coating technique. The substrate was spin-coated by precursor sol solution 1, 5, 15 and 30 times. The samples were annealed after each spin-coating procedure at 1000°C for 5h in air. In the sol–gel process ethylendiamintetraacetic acid and 1,2-ethandiol, and triethanolamine and polyvinyl alcohol were used as complexing agents and as gel network forming agents, respectively. The coatings were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopies, profilometry and the contact angle measurements (CAM). It was demonstrated, that properties of calcium hydroxyapatite thin films depend on spinning and annealing times.","Malakauskaite-Petruleviciene, Milda;Stankeviciute, Zivile;Niaura, Gediminas;Prichodko, Aleksandra;Kareiva, Aivaras",2015-07-31,Ceramics International,"Calcium hydroxyapatite,Thin films,Silicon substrate,Spin-coating,Sol–gel processing",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.02.055,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.02.055
The effect of thermal annealing on Fe/TiO2 coatings deposited with the help of RF PECVD method. Part I. Chemical and phase composition,"Results of the studies on chemical structure and phase composition of both non-annealed and thermally annealed iron doped TiO2 coatings are presented. The coatings were synthesized with the help of radio frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (RF PECVD) and characterized by iron content in the range of 0–4.76at%. In these studies, an analysis of both elemental composition and chemical bonding was performed with the help of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was applied to determine phase composition and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used as a supplementary source of information. The obtained elemental composition data show that, apart from titanium, oxygen and iron, traces of chlorine as well as substantial amounts of carbon are present in the coatings. While chlorine has originated from plasma decomposition of TiCl4, used as a source of titanium, a presence of carbon is associated with a surface contamination resulting from photocatalytic reactions of TiO2 with the adsorbed carbon dioxide. The results of XPS and FTIR indicate that thermal annealing not only modifies phase composition of these materials, but also affects chemical bonding. Finally, XRD analysis shows that iron content has an effect on the size of coherent diffraction domains present in the films.","Sobczyk-Guzenda, Anna;Owczarek, Sławomir;Batory, Damian;Balcerzak, Jacek;Gazicki-Lipman, Maciej;Szymanowski, Hieronim",2017-04-01,Ceramics International,"Fe/TiO2 coatings,RF PECVD method,Thermal annealing,Structure,Rutile",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.11.105,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.11.105
Design of dual-carbon modified MnO electrode improves adsorption and conversion reaction in Li-ion batteries,"MnO is considered one of the most promising anode materials, but how to design and improve its structure is still of importance. In this paper, novel composites structure of carbon coated MnO anchored on reduced graphene oxides sheets (C@MRGO) are fabricated by a two-step hydrothermal and following heat treatment process. The prepared C@MRGO exhibits a superior performance of 1178, and 665mAhg−1 at 100 and 1000mAg−1, respectively. Comparison study finds that this novel structure greatly improved the conversion reaction and adsorption capacity of MnO particles. Further study shows that two different carbons both promote the lithium storage process from a different perspective. Typically, graphene greatly improves conductivity and controls the crystallization and growth of MnO particles, while carbon coating could provide a good elastic restricted body to effectively keep the integrity of the SEI film, inhibited volume expansion and make the conversion reaction reversible. In addition, carbon coating adsorbs much Li+ to achieve higher capacity, due to the nature adsorption properties of carbon materials. The design of using different carbon to enhance MnO electrode is believed to bring inspiration to the structural construction in other transitional metal oxide systems for superior performance of energy storage.","Wang, Ruiyi;Cao, Liyun;Li, Jiayin;Xu, Zhanwei;Huang, Jianfeng;Cui, Yali;Wang, Caiwei",2018-02-15,Ceramics International,"MnO,Carbon composites,Structural design,Li-ion batteries",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.097,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.097
Analytical solution of quenching-induced deposition stress in functionally graded thermal barrier coatings,"Deposition stress caused by quenching of splats in the deposition process of Functionally Graded Thermal Barrier Coatings (FG-TBCs) has a profound influence on its residual thermal stress. In this work, according to the progressive thermal spray process of FG-TBCs, a theoretical solution is developed for predicting deposition stress caused by quenching of splats in the deposition process of FG-TBCs. The verification of this theoretical solution has been done by reduceing to Tsui and Clyne's model. The deposition stress filed evolution and the total/final deposition stresses during the deposition process of FG-TBCs have been studied, and stress concentrations in FG-TBCs and conventional TBCs have been compared. Meanwhile, the effect of some geometric parameters, such as the thickness of Functionally Graded Coating (FGC) and the substrate, has also been discussed. The results show that, compared with the deposition stress arisen in conventional TBCs, the deposition stress concentration in the FG-TBCs has been significantly reduced; the magnitudes of deposition stresses are the same at the top surface of FGC; however, they decrease at the bottom with the FGC thickness increasing; the magnitudes of the deposition stresses in the FGC decrease with the decrease of substrate thickness. This work may provide further insights into the development and optimization of more efficient FG-TBCs for industrial applications.","Ai, Song;Song, Yan;Yang, Bin;Han, Zelin;Wang, T.J.",2019-06-15,Ceramics International,"TBCs,FG-TBCs,Quenching stress,Deposition stress",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.163,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.163
The investigation of lithium doping perovskite oxide LiMnO3 as possible LIB anode material,"The perovskite type oxide Ca1-xLixMnO3-δ (x = 0, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) was prepared by a simple citric acid assisted sol-gel method and was investigated as a possible lithium ion anode material. XRD confirmed that up to 10% calcium element in the CaMnO3 lattice can be replaced by lithium without the obvious corruption of lattice symmetry or the appearance of the secondary phase. Although pure CaMnO3 exhibited poor electro-chemical performance, the introduction of lithium has greatly improved the electrochemical performance of Ca1-xLixMnO3-δ. Without carbon coating, the specific capacity of Ca0.95Li0.05MnO3-δ within the initial 10 cycles were maintained at ca. 480 mA h g−1, and after 50 cycles of rate capability testing it was estimated to be around 350 mA h g−1. The rate capability was also improved significantly. The detailed structural analysis of lithium doping CaMnO3 revealed that this improvement in the electro-chemical performance mostly likely originated from the extra lithium diffusion path between two 8c sites mediated by the 36 f oxygen vacancy in between. Further EIS and CV tests demonstrated that the lithium doping reduced the charge transfer resistance effectively and increased the lithium ion diffusion coefficient accordingly. Although the performance of lithium doping CaMnO3 was still inferior to the frequently investigated anode material like Si series or metal oxide series, the further improvement of the material was still possible by further modification of perovskite CaMnO3.","Fang, Minhua;Yao, Xiaolin;Li, Wanwan;Li, Yue;Shui, Miao;Shu, Jie",2018-05-31,Ceramics International,"Perovskite,CaMnO3,Sol-gel,Anode material,Lithium doping",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.02.002
A novel one-pot method to synthesize hierarchical mesoporous carbon foams with ZnO coating,"The ever more diverse applications of carbon materials require new fabrication methods to satisfy the demand of functionalization. This work seeks extending functionality of carbon foams known to be determined by their porous properties, which in turn are mainly produced during synthesis. In this work, we report a simple and versatile method to produce hierarchical mesoporous carbon with bottom-up grown crystalline ZnO coating obtained in one pot. The synthesis is based on foaming xylene-epoxy-zinc suspensions, which are further subjected to carbonizing treatments. Two carbon foams carbonized at high (1000 °C) and low (500 °C) temperatures are compared. During carbonization, zinc particles were found to diffuse towards the foam's surface and evaporate in case of the high temperature process, whereas reaction to form the crystalline ZnO coating was found in the low temperature process. The surface area and pore volume of the carbon foams depend on the carbonizing temperature due to the direct relation with the diffusion rate of particles in the material. This also explains the formation of the oxide layer at the foam external surface observed in the low temperature treatment. This work highlights the possibilities of improving the functionality of porous carbon materials by adding ceramic coatings.","Covaciu, M.;Ramos-Moore, E.;Rojas, S.;Lastra, N.;Armijo, F.;Walczak, M.",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Hierarchical porosity carbon,Ceramic coating",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.138,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.138
TiO2 nanotube coating on stainless steel 304 for biomedical applications,"The present study describes the anodic growth of TiO2 nanotube thin layer on stainless steel 304 in ethylene glycol/water/ammonium fluoride electrolyte. In this regard, pure titanium was coated on stainless steel 304 substrates by a physical vapor deposition magnetron sputtering (PVDMS) technique. The adhesion strength of the coating to the substrate was investigated. TiO2 nanotubes were generated on the top of the Ti coated substrates by means of anodization technique at a 25V potential and times of 20, 40, and 60min in an ammonium fluoride electrolyte solution. The anodized Ti-coated samples were heat-treated at 280°C, 430°C and 620°C in a N2 gas furnace to attain diverse phases. The mechanical properties of TiO2 nanotube arrays coated substrate were explored by a nanoindentation apparatus. The results illustrate that the Young׳s modulus and surface hardness of TiO2 nanotube-coated substrates are increased with increasing annealing temperatures (280°C, 430°C and 620°C). The scratch test results show that heat treatment at 430°C and 620°C can improve the adhesion strength of Ti/TiO2 coated samples by up to 2860 and 3140mN, respectively.","Zalnezhad, E.;Hamouda, A.M.S.;Faraji, G.;Shamshirband, S.",2015-03-31,Ceramics International,"TiO2 Nanotube,PVD magnetron sputtering,Adhesion,Biomedical",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.10.098,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.10.098
Wear behavior of Fe3Al-TiN-TiB2 HVOF coatings: A comparative study between in situ and ex situ powder processing routes,"In the present study, the tribological properties of High Velocity Oxy-Fuel (HVOF) coatings prepared from Fe3Al-based composite powders were investigated. The iron aluminide matrix of the composite powders was reinforced with TiN and TiB2 particles made using two different processing routes: a) an in situ method where fine ceramic particles were formed in the matrix by the reaction between Ti and BN, and b) an ex situ method where preformed coarse TiN and TiB2 particles were added to the matrix. The tribomechanical performance of the coatings was assessed using indentations and pin-on-disc wear tests. Compared to ex situ samples, the Fe3Al-based coatings strengthened with in situ ceramic particles exhibit higher microhardness and wear resistance regardless of the sliding velocity. The presence of voids, cracks and scratches/grooves in the wear track of the in situ coatings and the coating material transferred to the corresponding counterpart suggest that coatings with fine reinforcing particles fail predominantly via delamination and adhesive wear mechanisms. In the case of the ex situ coatings, the presence of a significant amount of hard ceramic particles within the wear track indicates that abrasive wear plays a dominant role in the degradation mechanism. Oxidation wear also contributed to material removal at high sliding velocity since transfer materials inside the wear track contain a high oxygen content compared to the unworn region regardless of the coating type.","Pougoum, Fabrice;Schmitt, Thomas;Martinu, Ludvik;Klemberg-Sapieha, Jolanta-Ewa;Savoie, Sylvio;Schulz, Robert",2017-08-01,Ceramics International,"Metal ceramic composites,Ball milling,In situ/Ex situ powder synthesis,Iron aluminides,HVOF,Wear",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.122,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.122
Intermediate gel coating on macroporous Al2O3 substrate for fabrication of thin carbon membranes,"To fabricate carbon membranes based on a low-cost macroporous Al2O3 substrate, a pretreatment called “intermediate gel coating” on the substrate was introduced. It can be carried out simply by coating the substrate with an AlOOH sol and drying to form a gel layer. The PFA (polyfurfuryl alcohol) was synthesized and coated on the gel-modified Al2O3 substrate, and the carbon membranes were obtained after a carbonization treatment. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetry (TG), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and pore-size analysis were conducted in material characterization, and the permeation performances of the carbon membranes were tested with H2, N2, O2 and CO2. Upon the substrate surface modification for fabrication of carbon membranes, such an intermediate gel coating method is superior to the traditional sol–gel treatment because the intermediate gel layer effectively prevented the PFA from penetrating into the macroporous substrate during coating and carbonization treatments so that a thin and uniform carbon layer can be created. The resulting carbon membranes exhibited promising gas permeability and permselectivity.","Wang, Chan;Hu, Xiaojuan;Yu, Jian;Wei, Lei;Huang, Yan",2014-08-31,Ceramics International,"Carbon membrane,Gas separation,Intermediate gel coating,Sol–gel coating,Surface modification",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.03.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.03.010
Ablation behavior of ZrB2–SiC protective coating for carbon/carbon composites,"Ablation behavior of ZrB2–SiC protective coating for carbon/carbon composites during oxyacetylene flame test at 2500°C was investigated by analyzing the microstructure differentiation caused by the increasing intensity of ablation from the border to the center of the surface. After ablation, a continuous SiO2 scale, a porous SiO2 layer inlaid with fine ZrO2 nuclei, and a continuous ZrO2 scale respectively emerged in the border region, the transitional region, and the center region. In order to investigate the ablation microstructure in the initial stage, the sub-layer microstructure was characterized and found to be mainly formed by coral-like structures of ZrO2, which showed huge difference with the continuous structure of ZrO2 on the surface layer. A kinetic model concerning the thickness change induced by volatilization and oxidation during ablation was built to explain the different growth mechanisms of the continuous ZrO2 scale and the coral-like ZrO2 structure.","Wang, Dini;Zeng, Yi;Xiong, Xiang;Li, Guodong;Chen, Zhaoke;Sun, Wei;Wang, Yalei",2015-07-31,Ceramics International,"Coating,Microstructure,Ablation,Ultra-high temperature ceramics",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.02.096,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.02.096
"Microstructural, surface and electrochemical properties of pulse electrodeposited Ni–W/Si3N4 nanocomposite coating","In this study, Ni–W/Si3N4 nanocomposite coatings were fabricated through pulse electrodeposition from an aqueous ammonia-citrate bath containing suspended silicon nitride (Si3N4) nanoparticles. The microstructural, surface and electrochemical properties were evaluated using SEM, AFM, EDS, XRD, XPS and EIS techniques. The effects of Si3N4 nanoparticles on the compositions and properties of the deposits were investigated. The results demonstrated that the electrodeposited Ni–W/Si3N4 coating had a compact, crack-free and homogeneous microstructure, containing 1.3–3.0 wt% Si3N4. The average roughness value (R a) and the root mean square roughness value (R q) of the coatings obtained at 10 g L−1 Si3N4 with the surface area of 9 µm2 were 17.4 nm and 22.34 nm, respectively. As for the coating obtained at 20 g L−1 Si3N4, the R a and R q value were 25.35 nm and 35.1 nm, respectively. XRD analysis indicated that the coatings prepared at different Si3N4 concentration had the same diffraction angle with the Ni phase except for the diffraction intensity. The Si3N4 particle concentration in bath influences the Si3N4 and W content, hardness, roughness, wear rate as well as corrosion resistance of the composite coating. The composite coating obtained at 15 g L−1 Si3N4 in as-deposited state acquires the maximum microhardness value of 953 ± 10 HV, meanwhile showed the least weight loss, thereby displaying the best wear resistance. XPS spectra illustrate that the coating surface consists of Ni, W, Si, N, O and C elements. The composites electrodeposited at 10 g L−1 Si3N4 has a higher content of metallic tungsten. With the increase of Si3N4 concentration, the R c and R p value gradually increased. The metallic Ni and W were reduced and deposited from the form of [ ( Ni ) ( HW O 4 ) ( Cit ) ] 2 − complex, including four consecutive steps, i.e., transportation, adsorption, reduction and incorporation.","Li, Baosong;Zhang, Weiwei",2018-11-30,Ceramics International,"Pulse electrodeposition,Ni-W/Si3N4,Nanocomposite coating,Microstructure,AFM",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.254,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.254
Magnetic behavior of Ga doped yttrium iron garnet ferrite thin films deposited by sol-gel technique,"Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) ferrites thin films having compositional formula Y3GaxFe5-xO12, where (x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) are synthesized by sol gel dip coating technique. XRD, SEM and VSM characterizations are employed to explore structural, morphological and magnetic properties, respectively. XRD showed that Ga is completely doped in YIG and not formed any cluster or other phase with YIG. SEM confirmed the formation of agglomeration of YIG particles. Magnetic parameters like coercivity, remnant squareness, saturation magnetization, magnetic moment, anisotropy constant, initial permeability Y–K angles and microwave frequency were calculated of these films. The coercivity and moderate magnetization suggested that fabricated ferrite films are highly applicable in electromagnetic microwave absorption and frequency agile antenna for wireless communication.","Khan, M.I.;Waqas, Muhammad;Naeem, M.A.;Hasan, M.S.;Iqbal, Munawar;Mahmood, Asif;Ramay, Shahid M.;Al-Masry, Waheed;Abubshait, Samar A.;Abubshait, Haya A.;Mahmood, Q.",2020-12-01,Ceramics International,"Ga,YIG,XRD,SEM,VSM",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.217,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.217
Structure and properties of plasma sprayed BaTiO3 coatings,Plasma spraying enables to create layers with thickness in a millimeter range adhering on various substrates. This paper provides a study of electric and mechanical properties of BaTiO3 coatings prepared by atmospheric plasma spraying. The spraying was carried out by a direct current gas-stabilized plasma gun. BaTiO3 was fed into the plasma jet as a feedstock powder prepared by a reactive sintering of micrometer-sized powders of BaCO3 and TiO2. Microstructure and phase composition are reported and discussed in connection with electric and mechanical properties. The ability of the used techniques to detect precisely the phase transformation temperatures of BaTiO3 plasma sprayed coatings is discussed as well. A depth-sensing indentation measurement was done between 290 and 520K to provide local mechanical characterization. The elastic modulus has shown slightly higher values than that reported typically in papers focused on BaTiO3 ferroelectric thin films. The average Vickers microhardness is tested to characterize the samples in larger scale. A wear resistance in a slurry environment is reported as well. Dielectric properties are reported for the temperature window of existence of the tetragonal ferroelectric phase. Relative permittivity and loss factor are studied at frequency from 50Hz to 1MHz and temperature from 260 to 400K.,"Ctibor, Pavel;Ageorges, Helene;Sedlacek, Josef;Ctvrtlik, Radim",2010-09-30,Ceramics International,"C.

Propagation feature of cracks in plasma-sprayed YSZ coatings under gradient thermal cycling,"The cracking behavior of plasma-sprayed yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) during thermal gradient cycling test was investigated. The relationship between the size of the bright spot observed on YSZ coating surface and the size of the crack in thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) was examined by introducing pre-cracks in TBCs assisted with finite element analysis (FEA). The cracking behavior during thermal cycling, and the relationship between the residual lifetime of TBCs and the crack size were examined. Results show that the bright spot observed on YSZ surface corresponds to the crack in the coating and thus the size of bright spot increases with crack size. It was found that the crack size increases linearly with thermal cycle number when the relative thermal cycle number is less than 85% of thermal cyclic lifetime. The crack propagation acceleration at the later stage of lifetime is attributed to coalescence of numerous cracks. The obvious coalescence of cracks in TBCs begins to take place when the residual lifetime becomes approximately 15%, which leads to a rapid decrease of the residual lifetime of YSZ coating with the increase of thermal cycle number.","Dong, Hui;Yang, Guan-Jun;Cai, Hong-Neng;Li, Cheng-Xin;Li, Chang-Jiu",2015-04-30,Ceramics International,"Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs),Bright spot,Crack propagation,Gradient thermal cycling",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.10.174,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.10.174
"The tribological performance of TiN, WC/C and DLC coatings measured by the four-ball test","An innovative approach to improving the wear resistance and load-carrying capacity of surfaces is by development of novel systems featuring coating treatment. Evaluation of the tribological performance of three physical vapor deposition (PVD) coatings, namely, TiN, WC/C, and DLC (diamond-like carbon), is necessary to determine their suitability as coatings for high-speed and heavy-duty power-transmitting gears. The uncoated and coated steel balls were subjected to four-ball tests under lubricated conditions. An optical microscope and a scanning electron microscope were used to observe wear scars, and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis was performed to determine the chemical compositions of the materials; these methods were also used to analyze the wear mechanisms. The wear performance of the three coatings was compared, and a four-ball method extreme pressure test was performed to determine the last nonseizure load of each tribo-pair. The WC/C and DLC coatings showed excellent tribological performance under high contact pressures and thermal loads, and the benefits of these coatings increased with decreasing performance of the lubricating medium. Therefore, WC/C and DLC coatings are suitable for application in high-speed and heavy-duty gears. Oxidation wear and peeling, fatigue pitting, and adhesive transfer are the main coating failure modes of the TiN, WC/C, and DLC coatings, respectively.","Xiao, Yangyi;Shi, Wankai;Luo, Jing;Liao, Yijian",2014-06-30,Ceramics International,"PVD coatings,Tribological performance,Four-ball test,Wear mechanisms,Extreme pressure",10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.12.015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.12.015
Structure and surface properties of Al2O3–TiO2 ceramic coated AZ31 magnesium alloy,"Magnesium and its alloys are the engineering materials which have the potential ability to be able to used widely particularly in the automotive, aerospace and in the biomedical sectors, especially thanks to their features such as lightness, specific strength that they have and biocompatibility. However, due to their poor wear resistance and corrosion resistance, the areas of usage are being restricted. This situation prevents Mg alloys to be used without any surface protection despite their good mechanical properties such as high strength/weight ratio. In this study, plasma spraying method is used to improve the poor corrosion resistance of AZ31 Mg alloy. Al2O3–13wt% TiO2 (AT13) and Al2O3–40wt% TiO2 (AT40) composite ceramic coatings were coated successfully on the surfaces of AZ31 Mg samples. The wear properties of the AT13 and AT40 coated samples were investigated for tribological applications. Surface morphology and microstructure of the duplex treated samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The microhardness value of the uncoated AZ31 Mg alloy is 40±3 HV0.1, while the microhardness values of the AT40 and AT13 coatings are enhanced to 800±39 HV0.1 and 1500±35 HV0.1, respectively.","Çelik, İlhan",2016-09-30,Ceramics International,"AZ31 Mg alloy,Plasma spraying,Al2O3–TiO2,Wear,XRD/SEM",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.162,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.05.162
I: Dispersibility of robust alumina particles in non-aqueous solution,"This article presents the preparation of well dispersed alumina slurries containing relatively large alumina particles that can withstand accelerated weather conditions. Besides using conventional dispersants such as phosphate esters and menhaden fish oil, dispersants widely used in the surface coatings industries such as Disperbyk 110 and Triton X 100 have also been employed. However, sedimentation tests, sediment density, viscosity and gloss measurements indicate the failure of the anionic dispersants as well as menhaden fish oil to disperse the alumina particles in non-aqueous medium. Instead the binder polyvinyl butyral itself acts as the best dispersant. The well dispersed alumina slurry is stabilized in the presence of a commercially available rheology modifier, Bentone SD2 for a period of 144h at 60°C. The rheological behavior of the aged sample was studied under various conditions. Although a rise in viscosity of the suspension was observed when the slurry was exposed to accelerated weather conditions, a lower shear thinning index and higher gloss values indicate a better dispersion state with aging.","Mukherjee, Amit;Khan, R.;Bera, B.;Maiti, H.S.",2008-04-30,Ceramics International,"A.

Hydrophobic composite coatings with photocatalytic self-cleaning properties by micro/nanoparticles mixed with fluorocarbon resin,"A newly developed hydrophobic composite coating was fabricated by incorporating modified TiO2 nanoparticles and hydrophobic material polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) micropowders dispersed in fluorocarbon resin. Moreover, the surface characteristics and self-cleaning properties of the newly developed composite material were examined. The material was found to exhibit sufficient hydrophobicity with a water contact angle of 133°. The surface free energy of the composite coating was 4.11mJ/m2. Scanning electron microscopy results revealed a micro/nanocomposite structure composed of PTFE micropowders and TiO2 nanoparticles, which was verified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results. Through ultraviolet irradiation the modified TiO2-PTFE/FEVE composite coating successfully removed oleic acid absorbed on its surface. These results showed that the functional composite coating had a sufficiently hydrophobic surface with an efficient self-cleaning effect.","Zhou, Yi;Li, Mengyao;Zhong, Xian;Zhu, Zhiping;Deng, Pan;Liu, Hai",2015-05-31,Ceramics International,"Film,Composite,TiO2,Fluorocarbon resin,Self-cleaning properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.12.090,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.12.090
Enhanced electrochemical performance of surface modified LiCoO2 for all-solid-state lithium batteries,"Li2CO3-coated LiCoO2 powders are prepared from a lithium hydroxide solution via low-temperature heat treatment and the effects on the electrochemical performance of all-solid-state lithium ion batteries (ASS-LIBs) using Li2S-P2S5 glass-ceramic solid electrolytes are investigated. A combination of X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analyses reveals that the Li2CO3 particles on the surface of LiCoO2 particles are formed without significant change in LiCoO2 structure. While the Li2CO3 is regarded as an impurity phase in lithium battery systems using liquid electrolytes due to its detrimental effects on electrochemical performance, we show that optimal amounts of Li2CO3 coating effectively suppress interfacial side reactions without a significant decrease in interfacial kinetics for all-solid-state lithium battery systems using sulfide solid electrolytes.","Kim, Junghoon;Kim, Minjeong;Noh, Sungwoo;Lee, Giho;Shin, Dongwook",2016-02-01,Ceramics International,"All-solid-state lithium ion battery,Sulfide solid electrolyte,Surface modification,Lithium carbonate,Interface",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.09.126,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.09.126
Microstructure and dielectric properties of SrTiO3 ceramics by controlled growth of silica shells on SrTiO3 nanoparticles,"SrTiO3@SiO2 nanopowder was synthesized via a core-shell nano-scale technique that is known as the Stöber process. The effect of the SiO2 concentration on microstructure, dielectric response and energy storage properties of SrTiO3@SiO2 ceramics was investigated. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results confirmed the formation of core–shell nanostructures with controlled shell thicknesses between 2nm and 13nm. After increasing SiO2, a secondary phase with Sr2TiSi2O8 appeared due to inter-diffusion reactions between the SrTiO3 core and SiO2 shells during the sintering process. The results show that both breakdown strength and energy density improved apparently. The homogeneous coating of silica on ST cores is considered to dominate the contribution to improved breakdown strength. The composition for SrTiO3 coated with 2.5wt% SiO2 shows the maximum energy storage density (1.2J/cm3) and a breakdown strength of 310kV/cm. The former is higher than for pure SrTiO3 (0.19J/cm3). Measurements of the dielectric performance indicate that the SrTiO3@SiO2 ceramics possess good bias stabilities compared to pure ST ceramics.","Zeng, Fanzhou;Cao, Minghe;Zhang, Lin;Liu, Miao;Hao, Hua;Yao, Zhonghua;Liu, Hanxing",2017-07-31,Ceramics International,"SrTiO3 ceramics,Microstructure,Dielectric properties,Energy storage",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.073,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.073
Fabrication of tubular-type MF ceramic membrane with enhanced permeability by addition of PMMA in the support and evaluation of physical characteristics for wastewater treatment,"In this study, a novel tubular-type ceramic membrane with higher permeability was fabricated and its physical characteristics for microfiltration were evaluated. The membrane was composed of the support and active layer which is a coating of the support for selective permeation. Many macro pores under 1μm up to 40μm in diameter could be successfully formed in the support. Pores having a diameter less than one micrometer were generated by the melting of impurities or by contracting structures through sintering, and pore sizes above 1μm in diameter were also generated by the poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) melted through sintering of support. The permeability of ceramic membranes could be enhanced by formation of large-diameter pores in the support. The pressurized-type ceramic membrane filter system with OUT–IN filtration direction was also devised for water and wastewater treatment. Surface flushing of the membrane was performed to solve the clogging. After 40min of operation, flux recovered to 97% of initial flux (320Lm−2 h−1) by surface flushing. To evaluate the feasibility of the ceramic membrane filter system, effluent from the electrolysis process for wastewater treatment was applied. Total suspended solids could be eliminated completely, and 99.8% of colloids causing the turbidity of water could be removed through filtration by the membrane.","Yun, Chan-Young;Kim, Woo-Yeol;Son, Dong-Jin;Kim, Dae-Gun;Chang, Duk;Chang, Sung-Oun;Sunwoo, Young;Hong, Ki-Ho",2015-11-30,Ceramics International,"Ceramic membrane,Tubular-type,Microfiltration,Out–in filtration,Wastewater treatment",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.05.016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.05.016
Enhancing the high-voltage performances of Ni-rich cathode materials by homogeneous La2O3 coating via a freeze-drying assisted method,"The major limitations of layered LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathode materials are their severe capacity decay and marked impedance increase under a high cutoff voltage. Herein, a LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 powder was successfully encapsulated by a compact and continuous La2O3 thin layer via a facile freeze-drying method. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The excellent thermal stability and favorable lithium ion conductivity of the La2O3-modified sample lead to a substantial improvement in its electrochemical performances. In particular, the coated sample exhibits a capacity retention of 80% at 1 C over 150 cycles, while that of the bare electrode is only 58% at a high cutoff voltage of 4.6 V. The alternating current impedance and cyclic voltammetry tests reveal that the La2O3 coating can reduce the cell polarization and enhance the electrochemical activity of cathode materials.","Ren, Ting;Zhang, Jufeng;Wang, Ding;Dong, Peng;Duan, Jianguo;Li, Xue;Rao, Shuai;Huang, Dianhua;Zhang, Yingjie",2018-08-15,Ceramics International,"High voltage,Layered cathode materials,LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2,Electrochemical performance,Freeze-drying",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.092,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.092
Direct multipulse laser processing of titanium oxide–graphene oxide nanocomposite thin films,"Nanocomposite thin films consisting of titanium oxide (TiO2) nanoparticles (NPs) and graphene oxide (GO) platelets were deposited by a spin-coating technique. The obtained films were submitted to direct laser irradiation using a frequency quadrupled Nd:YAG (λ=266nm, τ FWHM≅3ns, ν=10Hz) laser source. The effect of the laser processing conditions, as laser fluence value and number of subsequent laser pulses incident onto the same target location, on the surface morphology, crystalline structure, and chemical composition of the TiO2/GO nanocomposite thin films was systematically investigated. The laser fluence values were maintained below the vaporization threshold of the irradiated composite material. With the increase of the laser fluence and number of incident laser pulses melting and coalescence of the TiO2 NPs into inter-connected aggregates as well as rippling of the GO platelets take place. The gradual reduction of GO platelets and the onset of anatase to rutile phase transition were observed at high laser fluence values.","Pérez del Pino, A.;Datcu, A.;György, E.",2016-05-01,Ceramics International,"Titanium oxide–graphene oxide nanocomposite thin films,Direct laser irradiation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.01.122,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.01.122
Cadmium sulfide activated zinc oxide coatings deposited by liquid plasma spray for room temperature nitrogen dioxide detection under visible light illumination,"Zinc oxide (ZnO) is well-known to be used as a gas sensing material. However, due to its high operation temperature, the chemical and thermal stability of ZnO based gas sensors are relatively low. In recent years, some researchers adopt light illumination as activated source to replace heating and obtain high gas sensing performance at low temperature. The study that follows is an attempt to use cadmium sulfide (CdS) as sensitizer to activate ZnO at room temperature with assistance of visible-light illumination. CdS–ZnO coatings were deposited by liquid plasma spray with aqueous solution containing zinc acetate and cadmium sulfide as precursors. The crystal structure of as-sprayed CdS–ZnO coatings was characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The sensing performance of sensors based on CdS–ZnO coatings were tested with 1ppm nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at room temperature illuminated under various visible lights. The results demonstrated that the LPS process was a straightforward method for deposition of high performance CdS–ZnO sensitive layers and the obtained sensors showed high responses to NO2 at room temperature.","Geng, Xin;Zhang, Chao;Debliquy, Marc",2016-03-31,Ceramics International,"CdS activated ZnO,Liquid plasma spray,Nitrogen dioxide,Visible light illumination,Gas sensor.",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.11.170,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.11.170
Erosion resistant composite coating on rigid carbon fiber felt,"Rigid carbon fiber felt (RCFF) was surface modified with a composite coating via a two-step technique of pasting and chemical vapor deposition. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction were performed to analyze the microstructure of the substrate and the composite coating. The effect of the deposition time on solid particle erosion properties of RCFF modified by a composite coating was investigated. The pyrolytic carbon can decrease the surface porosity of a carbon fiber cloth, resulting in a dense composite. Compared with the substrate, the composite coating exhibited good erosion resistance and reduced the mass loss of the substrate by a factor of 19. The strengthening mechanism was discussed in this paper, and crack propagation along the interface between a carbon fiber and pyrolytic carbon sheath was found to occur; the crack propagation is an important factor for improving erosion resistance.","Shi, Wei;Tan, Yi;You, Qifan;Lu, Tong;Li, Jiayan",2016-04-30,Ceramics International,"Solid particle erosion,Composite coating,Rigid carbon fiber felt,Erosion behaviors",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.12.124,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.12.124
Influence of loadings of single-walled carbon nanotubes on the performance of ZnO nanorod-based dye-sensitized solar cells,"Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are a promising low-cost alternative to silicon-based photovoltaic solar cells. Thus, this study was initiated with the aim of combining the unique physical and chemical properties of both SWCNTs and metal oxide nanostructures (such as ZnO-NR) for assembling novel building blocks for solar cells and light energy harvesting devices. DSSCs based on ZnO nanorods/single-walled carbon nanotubes (ZnO-NR/SWCNT) nanocomposite were prepared by the hydrothermal and spin coating method. The photoelectric performances of the DSSCs with various SWCNT loadings up to 1.00wt% were compared. A gradual increase in the power conversion efficiency (η) was observed up to SWCNT loading of 0.50wt%, at which the power conversion efficiency of fabricated cells increased to 3.4% compared to 1.97% without SWCNTs. However, further increases in SWCNTs loadings significantly reduced cell performance. Furthermore, the maximum dye absorption intensity was attained at the SWCNT loading of 0.50wt%. Compared to the DSSC with ZnO-NR electrode, the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSC with 0.50wt% SWCNTs loading showed an increase in the short-circuit photocurrent (J sc) of 38% leading to an increase in (η) by a factor of approximately 1.7.","Albiss, Borhan A.;Al-Widyan, Mohamad I.;Obaidat, Ihab",2016-02-01,Ceramics International,"ZnO nanorods,SWCNT,DSSC,Hydrothermal method",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.10.167,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.10.167
Subsurface oxidation of boron nitride coatings on silicon carbide fibers in SiC/SiC ceramic matrix composites,"In a SiC/SiC ceramic matrix composite, oxygen penetrates through unprotected ends of boron nitride coated silicon carbide fibers by ends-on oxidation in ambient air at 1200–1285 °C. For oxidation times and temperatures that cause only a few microns of oxide to form on the matrix, the boron nitride coatings can be oxidized to a depth of several hundred microns.

Influence of Cu coating of SiC particles on mechanical properties of Ni/SiC co-electrodeposited composites,"In this paper, the study of the mechanical properties of composites consisting of electrodeposited Ni and co-electrodeposited SiC particles coated with a thin Cu layer was presented. It was demonstrated that the coating allowed to increase the concentration of ceramic particles in the composite. Although the plating parameters were the same for both types of composites, the concentration of SiC was 15% for the composite containing coated particles (Ni/SiC-Cu) and 10% for the composite containing uncoated particles (Ni/SiC). Furthermore, tensile tests showed that the Ni/SiC-Cu samples exhibited higher Young's modulus than the pure electrodeposited Ni samples or Ni/SiC samples. The measured Young's modulus of the Ni/SiC-Cu composite was 250 ± 10 GPa. However, the ultimate tensile strength of the Ni/SiC-Cu composite was lower than that of pure Ni. To explain the mechanical behaviour of the Ni/SiC-Cu composite, the microstructure of the interface of this composite and its bonding strength were studied. Microstructure studies conducted using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) revealed that the SiC/Cu interface was smooth and of good quality whereas the Cu/Ni interface was rough but also of good quality. The measured bonding, normal, and shear strength values demonstrated that the SiC/Cu interface was weak, and that was the main reason for the low ultimate tensile strength of the composite. The shear strength of the SiC/Cu interface was measured using a novel method: micropillars shearing including atomic force microscopy (AFM). Finally, a simple finite element model of the Ni/SiC-Cu composite, based on cohesive elements, was developed.","Jarząbek, Dariusz M.;Dziekoński, Cezary;Dera, Wojciech;Chrzanowska, Justyna;Wojciechowski, Tomasz",2018-12-01,Ceramics International,"Interfacial bonding strength,Metal matrix composites,Tensile strength,Silicon carbide,Electrodeposited nickel",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.271,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.271
Effect of Sn4+ doping on the photoactivity inhibition and near infrared reflectance property of mica-titania pigments for a solar reflective coating,"The influence of Sn4+ doping on the photoactivity inhibition and near infrared reflectance property of mica-titania pigments was investigated. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed that Sn4+doping promoted phase transformation from anatase to rutile. The rutile promoting effect of Sn4+ can be ascribed to the distortion of the crystal structure of anatase after the replacement of Ti4+ by Sn4+. Sn4+ doping had a great influence on the photoactivity of mica-titania pigments. The photoactivity of mica-titania pigments was enhanced at low dopant levels, whereas its photoactivity was inhibited at high dopant levels. Remarkably, the degradation rate constant of mica-titania pigments doped with 1.0wt% of SnCl4 was approximately 12.9% of that of the undoped sample. A possible mechanism for this effect was proposed. Moreover, the near-infrared solar reflectance of mica-titania pigments reached 0.97. An approximately 8.3°C decrease in temperature was obtained for the inner surface of a calcium silicate board coated with mica-titania pigments. Furthermore, a solar reflective coating coloured with low photocatalytic mica-titania pigments exhibited high photostability against weathering conditions. Therefore, mica-titania pigments with high levels of the Sn4+dopant are excellent candidates for use in solar reflective coatings.","Gao, Qiang;Wu, Xiaomei;Ma, Yehong;Li, Dianquan;Fan, Yueming;Du, Chang",2016-11-15,Ceramics International,"TiO2 pigment,Near infrared reflectance,Photoactivity inhibition,Photostability,Solar reflective coating,Thermal insulation",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.08.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.08.002
"Fe3O4 nanoparticle-coated boron nitride nanospheres: Synthesis, magnetic property and biocompatibility study","Hybrid nanocomposites consisting of uniform Fe3O4 nanoparticles and boron nitride (BN) nanospheres were synthesized via an ethanol-thermal reaction method. The spherical BN nanoparticles (BNNSs) with average diameter 150nm have been uniformly coated with dense ultra-small Fe3O4 nanoparticles (with average diameter of 10nm), forming novel Fe3O4@BNNS nanocomposites. Magnetic measurement by using vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) indicates that the Fe3O4 coating is superparamagnetic, and the nanocomposites can be physically manipulated at a low magnetic field. Preliminary biocompatibility study has also been performed to evaluate the toxicity of the nanocomposites. The nanocomposites show cytocompatibility at low concentration and have little effect on cell viability of MCF-7, MCF-10 and Hela cell lines. The Fe3O4@BNNS nanocomposites may find a wide range of potential applications including water treatment, catalysts, carriers for boron neutron capture therapy and magnetic-targeted drug delivery.","Wang, Weijia;Lin, Jing;Xing, Chengfen;Chai, Ran;Abbas, Saleem;Song, Tao;Tang, Chengchun;Huang, Yang",2017-06-01,Ceramics International,"Coating,Boron nitride,Hybrid nanomaterial,Biocompatibility,Superparamagnetic,Transmission electron microscopy",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.02.047,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.02.047
Tribological behavior of DLC films and duplex ceramic coatings under different sliding conditions,"Diamond-like carbon (DLC) films are effectively utilized to improve the tribological properties of materials due to their low friction coefficient, good wear resistance and high hardness. In recent years, different pre-treatments such as plasma assisted diffusional processes have been used to increase long-term durability of these coatings. In the present work, DLC films were deposited on untreated and plasma nitrided AISI 4140 low-alloy steel samples using physical vapor deposition method (PVD). The effect of nitride layers on the structural and mechanical properties of DLC films was examined by XRD, SEM, microhardness tester and reciprocating tribotester. The wear tests were performed under dry, saltwater and lubricant environments. The microhardness results indicated that surface hardness considerably increased after duplex treatment and this caused to increase plastic deformation resistance of the material. The reciprocating test results showed that DLC films deposited on untreated and plasma nitrided samples reduced the coefficient of friction because of the formation of transfer film between sliding/mating surfaces. Also, wear rates improved significantly after duplex treatment in consequence of high plastic deformation resistance of duplex treated samples. The highest wear resistance was obtained in lubricated condition while the lowest wear resistance was for the samples tested in dry conditions.","Kovacı, Halim;Yetim, Ali Fatih;Baran, Özlem;Çelik, Ayhan",2018-04-15,Ceramics International,"DLC,Plasma nitriding,Wear,Friction,Duplex treatment,Lubricant",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.158,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.158
"Synthesis, spray granulation and plasma spray coating of lanthanum phosphate nanorods for thermal insulation coatings","Nanorods of lanthanum phosphate obtained by a wet chemical precipitation route were granulated to obtain sizes in the range of 10–15µm by spray drying from aqueous slurry of 35wt% solid loading and 2wt% of PVA binder. The powders thus obtained displayed enhanced flowability and were plasma sprayed on to stainless steel substrates resulting in the formation of adherent coatings of 150–180µm thickness. These coatings were characterized using electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis and Raman spectroscopy. X-ray analysis indicated phase instability of LaPO4 during plasma spraying resulting in the formation of oxy and polyphosphates of lanthanum (La2P4O13 and La3PO7). However, post deposition heat treatment of coated samples at 1100°C for 2h resulted in the reversible formation of stoichiometric lanthanum orthophosphate (LaPO4). Raman spectral analysis was used to confirm the phase structure of the coatings deposited at various plasma input powers. The coatings obtained were found to effectively lower the thermal conductivity of the substrates from ~24W/mK to less than 19W/mK (~10%) even at 200°C.","Midhun, M.;Pragatheeswaran, A.;Sankar, S.;Shijina, K.;Firozkhan, M.;Peer Mohamed, A.;Ananthapadmanabhan, P.V.;Warrier, K.G.K.;Hareesh, U.S.",2017-04-15,Ceramics International,"Lanthanum phosphate,Sol-gel process,Spray granulation,Coatings,Plasma spray coatings",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.120,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.12.120
Fabrication and preliminary biological evaluation of a highly porous biphasic calcium phosphate scaffold with nano-hydroxyapatite surface coating,"Considering that the structure of scaffold determines its functionality, in this study biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) scaffold with highly interconnected macroporous structure was firstly fabricated by a polymeric sponge replication method, in which a ethanol solution (25vol%) was use for preparation of the slurry and a varying slurry viscosity during multiple impregnations was adopted. Then, the surface coating consisting of nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) particles was formed by a dip coating technology, i.e. immersing the porous scaffold into the nHA slurry (20mg/mL) and sintering it at 650°C. Preliminary in vitro experiments showed that compared to BCP one, nHA-coated BCP scaffold could increase protein adsorption, form more complex bone-like apatite, and promote cell adhesion and proliferation, indicating that nHA-coated BCP scaffold exhibited superior biocompatibility and bioactivity. It might be attributed to its surface nanostructure and abundant nano- to micro- scale pores (< 10µm). This nHA-coated BCP scaffold with both trabecular framework and surface nanoscale topography holds great promise in serving as bone graft for the orthopedic application.","Wang, Jing;Zhu, Yu;Wang, Menglu;Liu, Dan;Chen, Xuening;Zhu, Xiangdong;Yang, Xiao;Zhang, Kai;Fan, Yujiang;Zhang, Xingdong",2018-02-01,Ceramics International,"BCP scaffold,nHA coating,Sponge replication,Dip coating,Biocompatibility",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.053,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.053
Calcium phosphates of biological importance based coatings deposited on Ti-15Mo alloy modified by laser beam irradiation for dental and orthopedic applications,"Ti-15Mo alloy samples were irradiated by pulsed Yb:YAG pulsed laser beam under air and atmospheric pressure. Sequentially, calcium phosphate coatings were deposited on the irradiated surfaces by the biomimetic method. The formation of calcium phosphates (CaP) under biological medium and SBF (Synthetic/Simulated Body Fluid) occurs in the presence of Ca2+ and PO4 3- ions, as well as ions such as: Mg2+, HCO3 -, K+ and Na+, which facilitates the mimicking of the biological process. The biomimetic calcium phosphates-based surfaces were submitted to heat treatment conditions at 350 °C and 600 °C. The present study correlates four conditions of fluency (1.91, 3.17, 4.16 and 5.54 J/cm2, respectively) as established have a sufficient energy to promote ablation on the laser beam irradiated surfaces. Likewise, it has been demonstrated the processes of fusion and fast solidification from the laser beam irradiation, under ambient atmosphere, inducing the formation of stoichiometric (TiO2) and non-stoichiometric titanium oxides (TiO, Ti3O, Ti3O5 and Ti6O) with different oxide percentages depending on the fluency applied. Besides that, laser modification has allowed a clean and reproducible process, providing no traces of contamination, an important feature for clinical applications. The morphological and physico-chemical analysis indicated the formation of a multiphase coatings depending on the heat treatment temperature performed to 350 °C (ACP1–2, CDHA, HA phases) and 600 °C (CDHA, HA and β-TCP phases). It is worth noting multiphasic bioceramic systems has been gaining attention for biomedical applications. The laser beam irradiation associated to bioactive coatings of calcium phosphates of biological interest have shown to be promising and economically feasible for use in clinical applications.","dos Santos, Marcio Luiz;dos Santos Riccardi, Carla;de Almeida Filho, Edson;Guastaldi, Antonio C.",2018-12-15,Ceramics International,"Ti-15Mo alloy,Calcium phosphate coatings,Yb:YAG Laser,Biomimetic method",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.010
High temperature fracture toughness and residual stress in thermal barrier coatings evaluated by an in-situ indentation method,"High temperature fracture toughness and residual stress are important for the evaluation of TBCs. In this paper, an in-situ high temperature indentation method was originally developed to investigate the high temperature fracture toughness and residual stress in a typical TBC, nanostructured 8 wt% yttria partially stabilized zirconia (YSZ) coating. The cracks caused by in-situ high temperature indentation tests were observed, and high temperature fracture toughness and residual stress were experimentally measured. The fracture toughness was measured to be 1.25, 0.91 and 0.75 MPa*m1/2 at 25, 800 and 1000 °C, respectively. The residual stress was measured to be − 131.3, − 55.5 and − 45.5 MPa, correspondingly. Moreover, the residual stress and fracture toughness both decrease with increasing environmental temperature. It is also found that the fracture toughness without consideration of residual stress is significantly larger than the intrinsic fracture toughness, which may result from the compressive stress state.","Qu, Zhaoliang;Wei, Kai;He, Qing;He, Rujie;Pei, Yongmao;Wang, Shixing;Fang, Daining",2018-05-31,Ceramics International,"TBCs,In-situ indentation method,High temperature fracture toughness,High temperature residual stress",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.230,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.01.230
Design and preparation of durable double-layer non-quarter-wave antireflective coatings,"In this work, optimized SiO2/TiO2, SiO2/Al2O3, SiO2/Si3N4, SiO2/Ta2O5, SiO2/anatase TiO2, and SiO2/rutile TiO2 double-layer non-quarter-wave antireflective coatings were designed with the aid of thin film design software TFCalc via trial and error. Compared to commonly used double-layer quarter-wave coatings, these long-ignored double-layer non-quarter-wave coating systems only require the refractive index of the selected bottom-layer coating material (n 1), upper-layer coating material (n 2), substrate (n s) and the incident medium (n 0) to satisfy the equation n 2/n 1≥ (n s/n 0)1/2, substantially expanding options for the coating materials. Moreover, two different optimum systems were separately found for the above two selected coating materials; SiO2/TiO2 non-quarter-wave coatings were prepared using the sol-gel method according to the designed optimum parameters and confirmed the feasibility of the above coating design. Interestingly, attractive abrasion resistance and broadband properties were simultaneously found in the prepared SiO2/TiO2 non-quarter-wave coatings, making this SiO2/TiO2 non-quarter-wave coating system desirable for actual applications in optical and display devices.","Ye, Longqiang;Ge, Xinming;Wang, Xuchun;Hui, Zhenzhen;Zhang, Yulu",2019-05-31,Ceramics International,"Thin film design,Antireflective coatings,Double-layer non-quarter-wave,Abrasion resistance,Broadband",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.162,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.162
Mechanical behavior and cell response of PCL coated α-TCP foam for cancellous-type bone replacement,"The mechanical behavior and cell responses of poly (ε-carpolactone) (PCL) coated α-tricalcium phosphate (α-TCP) foam were studied as an initial step for the fabrication of a cancellous-type artificial bone replacement. The α-TCP foam was obtained from sintering CaCO3 and CaHPO4·2H2O at 1500°C. It was then coated with PCL and its three dimensional fully-interconnected porous structure was found to be maintained. The coated α-TCP samples exhibited high porosity (80–85%) with large pore size (500–700μm) that mimic the cancellous bone structure. The PCL content of the coating layer increased from 9.3±0.4wt% to 19.0±1.3wt% when coated with 5wt% to 15wt% PCL. The compressive strength improved significantly upon PCL coating. The compressive strength of α-TCP foam, 30±10kPa, increased to 750±20kPa when coated with 15wt% of PCL solution. The in vitro biological evaluations indicated that MC3T3-E1 cells adhered and proliferated well on both the α-TCP and the PCL coated α-TCP foams. It was concluded that α-TCP foam upon coating with bioresorable PCL is of good potential to fabricate cancellous-type artificial bone replacement.","Bang, Le Thi;Tsuru, Kanji;Munar, Melvin;Ishikawa, Kunio;Othman, Radzali",2013-07-31,Ceramics International,"A.

"Structural evaluation, preliminary in vitro stability and electrochemical behavior of apatite coatings on Ti6Al4V substrates","Medical-grade alloys, such as Ti-6Al-4V, have been used for fixation of fractured bone and for the total replacement of defective bone. Their bioactivity could be improved by applying a bone-like apatite layer onto their surfaces. This, in turn, enhances their integration with the surrounding tissues upon implantation. In addition, the presence of a bioactive bone-like coating minimizes the likelihood of corrosion. Various methods are known for the formation of apatite coating onto Ti-6Al-4V, among which sputtering has shown its promise as a simple direct method. In the current work, a sputtering technique was used to develop a 300nm-thick bone-like apatite layer onto Ti-6Al-4V. Structural composition, integrity and morphology of the as-coated and thermally treated coatings were investigated. Coated substrates were further evaluated after soaking them in a simulated body fluid (SBF) for up to 14 days. Results showed the formation of an amorphous apatite layer onto the alloy, that was further shown to partially crystallize upon heat treatment. As a result of SBF treatment, the apatite layer was found to remodel through a dissolution-precipitation mechanism due to its amorphous and non-stoichiometric nature, forming a smooth layer with better homogeneity and decreased surface roughness. Electrochemical analysis of the coated alloys showed the enhanced corrosion protection of the alloy surfaces by coating them with apatite. In addition, pre-grinding of the alloy surfaces before the formation of the coating was also found to improve the corrosion inhibition of the alloy surfaces in aqueous media.","Greish, Yaser E.;Al Shamsi, Ahmed S.;Polychronopoulou, Kyriaki;Ayesh, Ahmad I.",2016-12-31,Ceramics International,"Hydroxyapatite,Sputtering,Ti-6Al-4V alloy,SBF,Corrosion inhibition",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.08.141,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.08.141
Effects of CVD SiBCN interphases on mechanical and dielectric properties of SiCf/SiC composites fabricated via a PIP process,"SiBCN coatings were successfully prepared on KD-II SiC fibers via a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process utilizing borazine and liquid polycarbosilane as precursors. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated the coating contained B–N, Si–C, C–C and Si–N bonds. Effects of the CVD SiBCN interphases on mechanical and dielectric properties of SiCf/SiC composites fabricated via a PIP process were investigated. The results showed that the composites with CVD SiBCN interphases exhibited an obvious toughened fracture behavior, and the flexural strength was about 2.25 times than that of the composites without SiBCN interphases. The composites containing SiBCN interphases had a higher strength retention ratio than that containing BN interphases. Furthermore, SiBCN interphases improved the fracture strength evidently, but hardly had influence on the dielectric properties of the SiCf/SiC composites.","Sun, Xun;Liu, Haitao;Li, Junsheng;Cheng, Haifeng",2016-01-31,Ceramics International,"B.

"Chromium carbide coatings produced on ductile cast iron QT600-3 by thermal reactive diffusion in fluoride salt bath: Growth behavior, microstructure evolution and kinetics","A series of chromium carbide coatings were formed on ductile cast iron QT600-3 by thermal reactive diffusion (TRD) processes in fluoride salt bath at 850–980 °C for 10 min ~ 40 h under an argon atmosphere. Coatings were analyzed by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX). The results demonstrate that the microstructure of chromium carbide coatings formed on ductile cast iron QT600-3 at 850 °C is related to the treatment time. At first 10 min, there is only a thin layer of Cr7C3 in the coating. At 1 h, the outermost layer of the coating is a thin Cr23C6 layer, and there is a thin M3C layer beneath the M7C3 layer. With increasing treatment time, the thickness of all layers in the coatings increases. For the sample treated for longer than 1 h, the microstructure of coating is Cr23C6, M7C3 and M3C from the outermost layer to the substrate. The microstructure of chromium carbide coatings formed on high C content steel substrates via TRD processes is independent with the composition of the base salt. The growth kinetics of chromium carbide coating follows a parabolic law with an activation energy of 129.906 kJ/mol. The evolution of hardness of coatings is consistent with the microstructure evolution of coatings.","Su, Xingzhi;Zhao, Sufang;Sun, Hua;Yang, Xingmei;Zhang, Peng;Xie, Leidong",2019-01-31,Ceramics International,"Growth behavior,Microstructure evolution,Chromium carbide coating,Thermal reactive diffusion",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.304,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.304
Influence of carbon incorporation on microstructure and properties of titanium diboride coatings deposited by combining ion beam with magnetron sputtering,"Titanium diboride (TiB2) coatings with carbon incorporation were deposited by a hybrid deposition method consisted of an ion beam and a pulsed magnetron sputtering using a gas mixture of acetylene (C2H2) and argon (Ar). The influence of carbon incorporation on composition, microstructure, mechanical properties and high temperature oxidation behavior of the TiB2 coatings was investigated using scanning electron micrograph, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, nanoindentation and Thermogravimetric analyzer as a function of the added carbon content. The results indicate that the carbon content of the coatings increases from 0 to 24.0 at. % as the C2H2 flow fraction increases from 0 to 10% in the C2H2/Ar gas mixture. It is found that the incorporated carbon atoms tend to form B–C bonds and exist mainly as an amorphous B–C phase in the coatings when the addition content of the carbon is relatively high. The amorphous B–C phases can refine the TiB2 grains and encapsulate the TiB2 grains to build nanocomposite structures, significantly improving the mechanical properties of the TiB2 coatings. In addition, the amorphous phases can make the TiB2 grains isolate oxygen and improve the oxidation resistance of the TiB2 coatings.","Dai, Wei;Gao, Xiang;Li, Xu;Wang, Qimin",2019-12-01,Ceramics International,"Titanium diboride,Carbon incorporation,Nanocoposite,Mechanical performance,Oxidation resistance",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.273,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.273

The electrochemical properties were characterized by rate charge/discharge measurements and cyclic voltammetry. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the TiNb6O17/C composite exhibits electrochemical properties superior to those of pure TiNb6O17, especially at high current rates. The initial discharge capacities of TiNb6O17/C are 239, 225.1 and 199.8mAhg−1 at 1, 5 and 10C, respectively. Even after 500 cycles at 10C, the capacity still remains 165.1mAhg−1, while the capacity of TiNb6O17 is only 74.8mAhg−1. The excellent electrochemical performance of TiNb6O17/C is attributed to the improvement of the electrical conductivity resulting from carbon coating.","Mao, Wutao;Bao, Keyan;Wang, Lin;Liu, Guangyin;Xie, Haiquan;Zhang, Ruixue;Zheng, Shaolong;Guo, Jiali;Li, Beibei;Wang, Weibo",2016-11-15,Ceramics International,"Lithium ion battery,TiNb6O17/C composite,Solid-state reaction,Electrochemical property",10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.193,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.193

The magnetisation of NZF films increased and coercive force decreased with the processing temperature. Typical values of magnetisation and coercive force of the NZF films have been found to be Ms=110 emu/cm3 and Hc=20 Oe, respectively.

Synthesis and thermophysical performances of (Nd1-xYbx)2AlTaO7 oxides for heat-insulation coating applications,"A series of novel (Nd1-xYbx)2AlTaO7 oxides for thermal barrier coating application were synthesized exploring multi-step solid state clotting technology, the phase composition and thermophysical performances were analyzed. Results show that with increasing Yb2O3 content, the obvious phase transformation from weberite lattice to pyrochlore structure can be found. Owning to influence of oxygen vacancy, thermal conductivity of obtained products is less than that of 8YSZ.

Ultrafast bone-like apatite formation on bioactive tricalcium silicate cement using mussel-inspired polydopamine,"The growing bone-like apatite layer at the tissue-implant interface is the essential condition for materials to bond robustly to surrounding bone and may provide a favorable environment for living bone formation. Inspired by versatility of mussel adhesive proteins, we developed an ultrafast and accessible route to accelerate effectively the formation of amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), the precursor phase of bone-like apatite, on the surface of polydopamine (PDA)-coated tricalcium silicate (TCS) within 5 min in simulated body fluid (SBF). The key of the method lies in successful preparation of PDA coating on the surface of hydrated TCS by simple dip-coating of hydrated TCS in an aqueous solution of dopamine. A strong adsorption between PDA coating and surface of hydrated TCS could be formed via bidentate hydrogen and electrostatic bonds. After 7 d of soaking in SBF, the bone-like apatite layer on the surface of PDA-coated TCS disk, about 91.1 µm in height was thicker than that on the surface of pristine TCS disk, determining about 49.5 µm. The results indicate that PDA coating can facilitate the kinetic deposition of bone-like apatite on its surface. The abundant Ca2+ ions and the lower interface energy of ACP at the interface between ACP and surfaces of PDA-coated TCS disks are responsible for the ultrafast precipitation of ACP and formation of bone-like apatite layer which is carbonated hydroxyapatite (HA) confirmed by different analytical tools. The route can open avenues for development of PDA-coated TCS biomaterials for hard tissue repair and substitution.","Wu, Meng;Wang, Tao;Wang, Yangyang;Wang, Hui",2019-02-15,Ceramics International,"Tricalcium silicate,Polydopamine,Bone-like apatite,Biomaterials,Attachment mechanism,Carbonated hydroxyapatite",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.149,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.149
Sol-gel fabrication of NiO and NiO/WO3 based electrochromic device on ITO and flexible substrate,"Electrochromic devices (ECDs) with reversible transmittance change represent a promising alternative to smart windows. However, the low−cost facile fabrication of ECDs, particularly flexible devices, remains challenging. In this study, novel NiO is synthesized by a solid state method, and the as−prepared NiO is introduced as an electrochromic anodic layer and fabricated onto a transparent conductive electrode (indium tin oxide, ITO or flexible silver nanowires, AgNW) by a sol–gel spin coating and low temperature annealing (80 °C-150 °C). The solvent, thickness of NiO, and annealing temperature are evaluated to obtain higher ECD performance. NiO/ITO ECDs exhibit very high transmittance variation (ΔT = ~84%) at 700 nm with applied potentials of −3.0 and 0 V. The stability and transmittance variation of NiO/ITO are significantly improved in the presence of a WO3 cathodic electrode at lower applied voltages of 1.5 to 0 V. The low processing temperature of 80 °C demonstrates the potential of the flexible ECDs. The flexible NiO–WO3 device achieves a transmittance variation of ~38% at 700 nm with applied potential of 2.0 and 0 V, and retains the ECD performance.

Phase distribution and phase composition were analysed using SEM and XRD. The results show that the pre-existing surface morphology mainly determines the phase distribution. Al2TiO5 and γ-Al2O3 are the main phases in the coating. In this experiment, the highest micro-hardness (1126.2HV0.2) was measured using a Vickers tester. Additionally, the wear rate of the highest micro-hardness coating is 0.0387mg/Nm, which is the lowest weight loss rate measured among all the samples.

Performance improvement of dye-sensitized solar cells by introducing a hierarchical compact layer involving ZnO and TiO2 blocking films,"The novel hierarchical compact layer involving ZnO and TiO2 blocking films is used to improve the overall performance of dye-sensitized solar cells. The ZnO compact films are fabricated as a bottom layer to block the electrons injection to the conductive glass and improve the open-circuit voltage. The TiO2 compact layer is employed to suppress back electron transfer and avoid ZnO contacting the acid dyes directly. The short-circuit current density of the DSSC containing the hierarchical compact layer is improved by 30% compared to that of one with only ZnO as the compact layer. The open-circuit voltage is increased by 4% after introducing the additional TiO2 blocking layer between the ZnO compact layer and mesoporous TiO2 layer. Overall, the short-circuit current density, open-circuit voltage and solar energy conversion efficiency are enhanced by 15.3%, 3.7% and 29.6%, respectively, relative to the traditional DSSC without any blocking layers.

Multilayer CVD Diamond Coatings in the Machining of an Al6061-15 Vol % Al2O3 Composite,"Ceramic cutting inserts coated with ten-fold alternating micro- and nanocrystalline diamond (MCD/NCD) layers grown by hot filament chemical vapor deposition (CVD) were tested in the machining of an Al based metallic matrix composite (MMC) containing 15 vol % Al2O3 particles. Inserts with total coating thicknesses of approximately 12 µm and 24 µm were produced and used in turning: cutting speed (v) of 250 to 1000 m·min−1; depth of cut (DOC) from 0.5 to 3 mm and feed (f) between 0.1 and 0.4 mm·rev−1. The main cutting force increases linearly with DOC (ca. 294 N per mm) and with feed (ca. 640 N per mm·rev−1). The thicker coatings work within the following limits: DOC up to 1.5 mm and maximum speeds of 750 m·min−1 for feeds up to 0.4 mm·rev−1. Flank wear is predominant but crater wear is also observed due to the negative tool normal rake. Layer-by-layer wear of the tool rake, and not total delamination from the substrate, evidenced one of the advantages of using a multilayer design. The MCD/NCD multilayer diamond coated indexable inserts have longer tool life than most CVD diamond systems and behave as well as most polycrystalline diamond (PCD) tools.","Shabani, Mohammadmehdi; Sacramento, Joaquim; Oliveira, Filipe J",2017,Coatings,CVD diamond; multilayer coating; turning; MMC; tool wear,10.3390/coatings7100165,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings7100165
Preparation and Properties of Composite Nanoceramic NiCrBSi-TiO2/WC(Co) Coatings,"Using the supersonic plasma spraying (SPS) technique, the preparation of a NiCrBSi (Ni60) coating was achieved by adding nano TiO2 in Ni60 coating with WC ceramic particles. Ni60-TiO2 (Ni60T) and Ni60-TiO2/WC coating (Ni60TW) were successfully prepared. Results show that of the three, Ni60T had the best densification, the porosity of the Ni60T coating exhibited the best value of 1.3%, and also has a stronger hardness value of 890 HV. At the same time, the coating corrosion resistance, wear coefficient, and the wear morphology of Ni60T are superior to Ni60 and Ni60TW coatings. It is added TiO2 and ceramic WC(Co) in Ni-based spraying powder. The main purpose is for the nanoparticles to achieve the effect of refining the grain, which can greatly improve the coating’s hardness and toughness.","Wang, Xinsheng; Xing, Zhiguo",2020,Coatings,SPS; nanoceramic coatings; microstructure; corrosion resistance,10.3390/coatings10090868,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings10090868
Micrographic Properties of Composite Coatings Prepared on TA2 Substrate by Hot-Dipping in Al–Si Alloy and Using Micro-Arc Oxidation Technologies (MAO),"A composite coating composed of intermetallic compounds, Al–Si alloys, and an oxide ceramic layer was prepared on TA2 substrate by hot-dipping Al–Si alloy and micro-arc oxidation (MAO) methods. The microstructure and composition distribution of the resulting hot-dipped Al–Si alloy layer and MAO-caused ceramic layer were studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrum (EDS). In addition, the phase composition of the diffusion layer obtained by the Al–Si alloy hot-dipping procedure was investigated by electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD), and the phase structure of the MAO-treated layer was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The MAO method can make the hot-dipped Al–Si alloy layer in-situ oxidized to form a ceramic layer. Finally, a three-layer composite coating composed of a diffusion layer formed by the Ti–Al–Si interdiffusion, an Al–Si alloy layer and a ceramic layer was prepared on TA2 substrate. Compared with TA2 substrate, the TA2 sample with a three-layer composite coating has larger friction coefficient and less abrasion loss. The three-layer composite coating can significantly improve the wear resistance of TA2. A technical composite method was developed to the low cost in-situ growth of alumina-based ceramic wear-resistant coatings on TA2 substrate.","Wang, Shaopeng; Zhou, Lian; Li, Changjiu; Li, Zhengxian; Li, Hongzhan; Yang, Lijing",2020,Coatings,hot-dipped Al–Si alloy; micro-arc oxidation; titanium,10.3390/coatings10040374,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings10040374
Synchronous Shot Peening Applied on HVOF for Improvement on Wear Resistance of Fe-based Amorphous Coating,"Shot peening was used synchronously to improve Fe-based amorphous coating performance by delivering ZrO2 ceramic particles into a low-temperature region of a flame during the high velocity oxygen flame (HVOF) spray process. The coating became denser, and its hardness became higher via the new process. Moreover, the compressive residual stress was induced by shot peening. The results from the dry friction test indicated that the coating’s wear resistance was enhanced obviously. The wear mechanism of coatings with and without shot peening is an abrasive wear combined with an oxidation wear at wear test conditions of a low load and a low frequency. The coating with the best wear resistance did not have the strongest microhardness but had the highest compressive residual stress. The compressive residual stress had a significant positive influence on the wear resistance at a low frequency, while its effect is weakened at a high frequency.","Zhou, Zhidan; Shang, Junchao; Chen, Yongxiong; Liang, Xiubing; Shen, Baolong; Zhang, Zhibin",2020,Coatings,HVOF; shot peening; wear; residual stress; amorphous,10.3390/coatings10020187,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings10020187
Physiochemical Effects of SiC and ZrO2 Particle Fillers on the Properties of Enamel Coatings,"The ceramic particles of SiC and ZrO2 are embedded as fillers in the enamel coating with varying contents of 0.03, 0.05, and 0.1 wt %, and the surface properties are measured. It is found that the addition of ceramic fillers indeed causes changes in surface properties. The roughness was influenced mainly by the particle size embedded. The contact angle decreased at 0.03 and 0.05 wt % and equivalent to that of no filler at 0.10%. Our analysis suggested that the contact angle is influenced by both surface roughness and surface morphology (with chemical composition). The microstructure and elemental analysis suggest that the chemical composition and shape of Al, Ce, Ca, and P-rich aggregates on the enamel surface are showing significant changes when fillers are added. It is observed that the Al- and Ce-rich aggregates decrease both in number and size as the filler content increases, and Ca-rich aggregates change their shape from needle to spot at 0.1 wt % inclusion. The washability is notably improved at 0.1 wt %, which corresponds to the content where the drastic microstructure change occurred. The examination of the contaminated surface revealed that the phosphate component in the contamination has reacted with the Ca-rich phase of the needle-shape during the process of burning, thus inhibiting an easy removal of the contamination. Therefore, the formation of the Ca-rich phase of the needle-shape on the enamel surface should be suppressed for easy-cleaning enamel coatings for cooking wares.","Ko, Hyunseok; Lee, Sung-Jin; Oh, Jae-Jong; Lee, Seungho; Lim, Hyung M",2020,Coatings,enamel; coatings; ceramic filler; SiC; ZrO2; washability,10.3390/coatings10020121,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings10020121
Electrodeposition of ZnO/Cu2O Heterojunctions on Ni-Mo-P Electroless Coating,"Electroless Ni-Mo-P coatings were deposited onto ceramic tiles in order to be employed as electrodes for the electrodeposition of ZnO and Cu2O heterojunction layers. Varying conditions, such as duration, annealing of the electroless coating and applied potential, and duration for ZnO electrodeposition were studied in order to optimize the properties of the ZnO/Cu2O heterojunctions toward improved photoelectrical performance. The coatings were evaluated in terms of morphology, crystalline structure, and by electrochemical and photoelectrical means. The obtained results indicated that a prolonged annealing treatment at low temperature is beneficial to improve the roughness and electrical conductivity of the Ni-Mo-P coating to further enhance the electrodeposition of ZnO. The morphology analysis revealed continuous and homogeneous Ni-Mo-P coatings. The formation of cube-like Cu2O crystals with larger grain size was induced by increasing the deposition duration of ZnO. The properties of ZnO layer are much improved when a higher cathodic potential is applied (−0.8 V) for 1 h, resulting in optimum photoelectric parameters as 1.44 mA·cm−2 for the JSC and 760.23 µV for the VOC value, respectively, for the corresponding heterojunction solar cell.","Rosas-Laverde, Nelly M",2020,Coatings,electroless coating; Ni-Mo-P; ceramic substrate; electrodeposition; ZnO; Cu2O,10.3390/coatings10100935,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings10100935
Microstructures and Oxidation Behavior According to Nb:Mo Ratio in a Nb–Mo–Si System with Si Pack Cementation Coatings,"Research is being conducted on Mo- and Nb-based alloys that are used in the aerospace sector, including those used for advanced gas turbines and aircraft engines. There is a limit to using Mo, which has a high density among refractory metals, and a few studies exist describing the addition of Nb to Mo–silicide alloys. There is a lack of guidance research on the basic Nb:Mo ratio of alloys, and it is necessary to study how to improve oxidation resistance. Therefore, this study aims to improve oxidation resistance by controlling the ratio of Nb and Mo in (Nbx, Moy)Si2 coating layers with Si pack cementation coatings on Nb–Mo alloys. Static oxidation tests were carried out at 1200 °C for 6 h to confirm the oxidation characteristics. As a result, a SiO2 or SiO2 + Nb2O5 ceramic protective layer was formed on the surface. After the oxidation tests, alloys with a Nb content of less than 35 at.% were found to protect the surface. The ratios of Nb and Mo in the Nb–Mo alloy and silicide coating layer were compared, and the improvement of oxidation resistance is discussed in terms of microstructural evolution.","Yang, Wonchul; Chung, Choong-Heui; Lee, Sangyeob; Lee, Jong W",2019,Coatings,coatings; oxidation; SEM,10.3390/coatings9120772,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings9120772
Wear and Corrosion Resistance of Chromium–Vanadium Carbide Coatings Produced via Thermo-Reactive Deposition,"Chromium carbide, vanadium carbide, and chromium–vanadium mixture coatings were deposited on AISI D2 steel via the thermo-reactive deposition/diffusion (TRD) technique. The carbides were obtained from a salt bath composed of molten borax, ferro-chrome, ferro-vanadium, and aluminum at 1020 °C for 4 h. Analysis of the morphology and microstructure of the coatings was done via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. The hardness of the coatings was evaluated using nano-indentation, and the friction coefficient was determined via pin-on-disk (POD) testing. The electrochemical behavior was studied through potentiodynamic polarization tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The XRD results show evidence of the presence of V8C7 in the vanadium carbide coating and Cr23C6 and Cr7C3 in the chromium carbide coating. The hardness value for the vanadium–chromium carbide coating was 23 GPa, which was higher than the 6.70 ± 0.28 GPa for the uncoated steel. The wear and corrosion resistance obtained was higher for the niobium–chromium carbide coating, due to the nature of the ceramic carbide produced.","Castillejo, Fabio; Olaya, Jhon J",2019,Coatings,carbides; chromium; corrosion; TRD diffusion; vanadium; wear,10.3390/coatings9040215,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings9040215
Stiffness of Plasma Sprayed Thermal Barrier Coatings,"Thermal spray coatings (TSCs) have complex microstructures and they often operate in demanding environments. Plasma sprayed (PS) thermal barrier coating (TBC) is one such ceramic layer that is applied onto metallic components where a low macroscopic stiffness favors stability by limiting the stresses from differential thermal contraction. In this paper, the Young’s modulus of TBC top coat, measured using different techniques, such as four-point bending, indentation and impulse excitation is reported, along with a brief description of how the techniques probe different length scales. Zirconia-based TBC top coats were found to have a much lower global stiffness than that of dense zirconia. A typical value for the as-sprayed Young’s modulus was ~23 GPa, determined by beam bending. Indentation, probing a local area, gave significantly higher values. The difference between the two stiffness values is thought to explain the wide range of TBC top coat Young’s modulus values reported in the literature. On exposure to high temperature, due to the sintering process, detached top coats exhibit an increase in stiffness. This increase in stiffness caused by the sintering of fine-scale porosity has significant impact on the strain tolerance of the TBC. The paper discusses the different techniques for measuring the Young’s modulus of the TBC top coats and implications of the measured values.","Paul, Shiladitya",2017,Coatings,Young’s modulus; thermal barrier coatings; plasma spray; yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ); four-point bending; indentation; impulse excitation technique; composite beam,10.3390/coatings7050068,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings7050068
Water Vapor Corrosion Behavior of Yb2SiO5 Environmental Barrier Coatings Prepared by Plasma Spray-Physical Vapor Deposition,"Tri-layer Si/mullite/Yb2SiO5 environmental barrier coating (EBC) was prepared on the SiCf/SiC ceramic matrix composite (CMC) by plasma spray-physical vapor deposition (PS-PVD). The EBC samples were carried out with water vapor corrosion at 1300 °C for 200 h. After steam corrosion, Yb2SiO5 layer forms a gradient porous structure. This is mainly due to the inclusion of SiO2-rich layer which is precipitated from the gasification inside the coating and existing a small amount of Yb2O3 separately. During the corrosion process, water vapor infiltrates into the coating and reacts with the SiO2 and Yb2O3 to generate volatile substances. This forms a porous structure to make the coating brittle, resulting in mud cracks finally. In addition, the results show that the Yb2SiO5 can react with the water vapor at the coating surface, forming an Yb2Si2O7 top layer.","Wang, Chao; Liu, Min; Feng, Junli; Zhang, Xiaofeng; Deng, Chunming; Zhou, Kesong; Zeng, Dechang; Guo, Shuangquan; Zhao, Ruimin; Li, Shuanghua",2020,Coatings,Yb2SiO5 coating; EBC; water vapor corrosion; PS-PVD,10.3390/coatings10040392,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings10040392
Evaluation of the Corrosion Resistance and Cytocompatibility of a Bioactive Micro-Arc Oxidation Coating on AZ31 Mg Alloy,"Magnesium alloys have recently been attracting attention as a degradable biomaterial. They have advantages including non-toxicity, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. To develop magnesium alloys into biodegradable medical materials, previous research has quantitatively analyzed magnesium alloy corrosion by focusing on the overall changes in the alloy. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a bioactive material by applying a ceramic oxide coating (magnesia) on AZ31 magnesium alloy through micro-arc oxidation (MAO) process. This MAO process is conducted under pulsed bipolar constant current conditions in a Si- and P-containing electrolyte and the optimal processing parameters in corrosion protection are obtained by the Taguchi method to design a coating with good anti-corrosion performance. The negative duty cycle and treatment time are two deciding factors of the coating’s capability in corrosion protection. Microstructure characterizations are investigated by means of SEM and XRD. The simulation body-fluid solution is utilized for testing the corrosion resistance with the potentiodynamic polarization and the electrochemical impedance test data. Finally, an in vivo testing shows that the MAO-coated AZ31 has good cytocompatibility and anticorrosive properties.","Jian, Shun-Yi; Ho, Mei-Ling; Shih, Bing-Ci; Wang, Yue-Jun; Weng, Li-Wen; Wang, Min-Wen; Tseng, Chun-Chieh",2019,Coatings,magnesium alloy; micro-arc oxidation; Taguchi method; SBF; in-vivo test; biodegradability,10.3390/coatings9060396,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings9060396
Zircon-Based Ceramic Coatings Formed by a New Multi-Chamber Gas-Dynamic Accelerator,"In this work, dense zircon-based ceramic coatings were obtained from inexpensive zircon powder on a steel substrate by using a new multi-chamber gas-dynamic accelerator. The microstructure and phase composition of the coating were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, optical microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The mechanical properties of the coatings were evaluated using microindentation, wear tests and bonding strength tests. The results showed that the obtained zircon-based ceramic coatings were continuous without cracks and bonded well with substrate without a sublayer. The zircon-based ceramic coatings consisted of c-ZrO2 (major phase), m-ZrO2 and SiO2. The zircon-based ceramic coatings had a porosity of 0.1%, hardness of 526 ± 65 HV0.2, and a fracture toughness of 2.5 ± 0.6 (МPа∙m1/2). The coatings showed the low specific wear rate and average erosion rate. The failure mode occurring in the tested coatings was cohesive.","Kovaleva, Marina; Prozorova, Mayya; Arseenko, Maria; Tyurin, Yuri; Kolisnichenko, Oleg; Yapryntsev, Maxim; Novikov, Vseslav; Vagina, Olga; Sirota, Viacheslav",2017,Coatings,zircon; coating; microstructure; micro-hardness; wear; multi-chamber gas-dynamic accelerator,10.3390/coatings7090142,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings7090142
Niobium-Containing DLC Coatings on Various Substrates for Strain Gauges,"Niobium-containing diamond-like carbon films (a-C:H:Nb) were deposited in a hybrid plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and direct-current magnetron sputtering (DCMS) process, using a niobium target in an argon/acetylene atmosphere on industrial polyimide foil, spin-coated polyimide foil, and alumina substrates. While the coating on the industrial foil tends to crack, the thin films on the spin-coated polyimide and the ceramic substrates showed good adhesion, as well as a smooth and dense topography. Investigations of the electrical properties revealed their suitability as biocompatible sensor materials in strain gauges, with a gauge factor of up to 3.2 and a temperature coefficient of the electrical resistance (TCR) of −200 ppm/K.","Grein, Maria; Gerstenberg, Jessica; von der Heide, Chresten; Bandorf, Ralf; Bräuer, Günter; Dietzel, Andreas",2019,Coatings,Nb-DLC; strain sensor; piezoresistivity; polyimide; crack formation; niobium carbide,10.3390/coatings9070417,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings9070417
"Effects of Cobalt Content on the Microstructure, Mechanical Properties and Cavitation Erosion Resistance of HVOF Sprayed Coatings","Cobalt-based alloy coatings and WC-Co-based ceramic–metal (cermet) coatings have been widely used because of their desirable mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. In this work, the influence of Co content on the microstructure, mechanical properties and cavitation erosion (CE) resistance were investigated. A cobalt-based alloy coating, a WC-12Co coating, and a WC-17Co cermet coating were deposited by high-velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) spraying on 1Cr18Ni9Ti substrates. Results indicate that the cobalt-based alloy coating had the largest surface roughness because surface-bonded particles of lower plastic deformation were flattened. The existence of WC particles had led to an increase in hardness and improved the fracture toughness due to inhibit crack propagation. The pore appeared at the interface between WC particles, and the matrix phase had introduced an increase in porosity. With the increase in Co content, the cohesion between matrix friction and WC particles increased and then decreased the porosity (from 0.99% to 0.84%) and surface roughness (Ra from 4.49 to 2.47 μm). It can be concluded that the hardness had decreased (from 1181 to 1120 HV0.3) with a decrease in WC hard phase content. On the contrary, the fracture toughness increased (from 4.57 to 4.64 MPa∙m1/2) due to higher energy absorption in the matrix phase. The WC-12Co and WC-17Co coatings with higher hardness and fracture toughness exhibited better CE resistance than the cobalt-based alloy coating, increasing more than 20% and 16%, respectively. Especially, the WC-12Co coating possessed the best CE resistance and is expected to be applicable in the hydraulic machineries.","Liu, Ji; Bai, Xiuqin; Chen, Tongzhou; Yuan, Chengqing",2019,Coatings,cobalt-based alloy; WC-Co; cobalt content; HVOF; mechanical properties; cavitation erosion,10.3390/coatings9090534,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings9090534
Hard Quasicrystalline Coatings Deposited by HVOF Thermal Spray to Reduce Ice Accretion in Aero-Structures Components,"Weather hazards, in particular icing conditions, are an important contributing factor in aviation accidents and incidents worldwide. Many different anti-icing strategies are currently being explored to find suitable long-lasting solutions, such as surface engineering, which can contribute to reduce ice accumulation. Quasicrystals (QCs) are metallic materials, but with similar properties to those of ceramic materials, such as low thermal and electrical conductivities, and high hardness. In particular, QCs that have low surface energy are commercially used as coatings to replace polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), also known as Teflon, on frying pans, as they do not scratch easily. PTFE exhibits excellent anti-wetting and anti-icing properties and therefore QCs appear as good candidates to be employed as ice-phobic coatings. Al-based QCs have been applied by High Velocity Oxyfuel (HVOF) thermal spray on typically used aeronautic materials, such as Ti and Al alloys, as well as steels. The coatings have been characterized and evaluated, including the measurement of hardness, roughness, wetting properties, ice accretion behavior in an icing wind tunnel (IWT), and ice adhesion by a double lap shear test. The coatings were studied, both as-deposited, as well as after grinding, in order to study the effect of the surface roughness and morphology on the ice accretion and adhesion properties. The QC coating was compared with PTFE and two polyurethane (PU)-based commercial paints, one of them known to have anti-icing properties, and the results indicate an ice accretion reduction relative to these two materials, and ice adhesion lower than bare AA6061-T6, or the PU paint in the ground version of one of the two QCs. Since the QC coatings are hard (GPa Vickers hardness > 5), a durable behavior is expected.","Mora, J",2020,Coatings,anti-icing; quasicrystals; aeronautics; surfaces; icing wind tunnel (IWT),10.3390/coatings10030290,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings10030290
A New Assistant Method for Characterizing Ablation Resistance of ZrC-SiC Dispersive Biphasic Coating on C/C Composites,"To optimize the ablation resistance of ZrC coating, ZrC-SiC dispersive biphasic coating was prepared by chemical vapor co-deposition. The ablation resistances of the coatings were carried out by oxyacetylene flame tests. Compared with double-layered ZrC/SiC coating, the ablation resistance of ZrC-SiC coating was evaluated. On the basis of similar mass ablation rates of the two coatings, a new assistant method for characterizing the thermal protecting effect of coatings on carbon-carbon composites (C/C) composites was proposed. The thermal protecting ability of the coating was accurately reflected by the changes of hardness and elastic modulus of C/C substrate below the central region of ablated coatings before and after ablation. The ablation processes of two kinds of coatings were also discussed. The results showed that the hardness and elastic modulus of the C/C substrate protected by ZrC-SiC coating were higher than that of C/C coated with ZrC/SiC coating. The result convincingly illustrated the thermal protecting ability of ZrC-SiC coating was much better than that of ZrC/SiC coating, which attributed to the formation of Zr-Si-O glass.","Feng, Tao; Tong, Mingde; Yao, Shuotian; Wen, Shifeng",2019,Coatings,ZrC-SiC coating; chemical vapor deposition; ablation resistance; ultrahigh temperature ceramic,10.3390/coatings9110735,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings9110735
Three-Dimensional Graphene Hybrid SiO2 Hierarchical Dual-Network Aerogel with Low Thermal Conductivity and High Elasticity,"We describe lightweight three-dimensional (3D) graphene hybrid SiO2 aerogels (GSAs) with hierarchically robust interconnected networks fabricated via an in situ deposition procedure after a hydrothermal assembling strategy with graphene oxide sheets. The nano-/micron-thick SiO2 coating conformably grew over porous graphene templates with two constituents (e.g., graphene and SiO2) and formed chemically bonded interfaces. In addition, it significantly refined the primary graphene pores by hundreds of microns into smaller porous patterns. Studies of its mechanical properties verified that the graphene interframework made the ceramic composites elastic, while SiO2 deposition enhanced the strength required it to resist deformation. The higher SiO2 contents resulted in lower elasticity but larger strength because of the apparent nanosize effect of SiO2 ceramic thickness; GSAs with a density of 82.3–250.3 mg/cm3 (corresponding to SiO2 sol with concentration ranging from 5 to 20 wt %) could reach a good balance of strength and elasticity. Benefiting from hierarchical micronetworks consisting of semiclosed or closed pores, GSAs offer excellent thermal-insulation performance, with thermal conductivity as low as 0.026 W/(m·K). GSAs offer improved fire-resistant capacity rather than that of pure carbon-based aerogels via the synergic protection of SiO2 ceramic accretion. This highlights the promising applications of GSAs as lightweight thermal-shielding candidates for industrial equipment, civil architectures, and defense transportation vehicles.","Zhang, Liwei; He, Peng; Song, Kunkun; Zhang, Jingxiang; Zhang, Baoqiang; Huang, Ruixian; Zhang, Qiangqiang",2020,Coatings,graphene hybrid SiO2 aerogels; mechanical properties; strength and elasticity; thermal insulation; fire-resistant capacities,10.3390/coatings10050455,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings10050455
Anti-Fouling Ceramic Coating for Improving the Energy Efficiency of Steel Boiler Systems,"Boilers are systems used mainly to generate steam in industries and waste-to-energy facilities. During operation, heat transfer loss occurs because a fouling layer with low thermal conductivity is deposited on the external surfaces of the boiler tube system, which contributes to the overall poor energy efficiency of waste-to-energy power plants. To overcome the fouling problem, a ceramic coating was developed and applied to carbon steel with a simple and inexpensive coating method. Anti-fouling testing, thermal conductivity measurement, and microstructure observation were performed to evaluate the performance of the coating. All evaluated properties of the coating were found to be excellent. The developed ceramic coating can be applied to boiler tubes in a real facility to protect them from the fouling problem and improve their energy efficiency.","Nguyen, Minh D",2018,Coatings,ceramic coating; fly ash; anti-fouling; slagging; boiler; energy efficiency,10.3390/coatings8100353,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings8100353
"Applying Baghdadite/PCL/Chitosan Nanocomposite Coating on AZ91 Magnesium Alloy to Improve Corrosion Behavior, Bioactivity, and Biodegradability","Magnesium alloys have received a great amount of attention regarding being used in biomedical applications; however, they show high degradability, poor bioactivity, and biocompatibility. To improve these properties, surface modification and various types of coatings have been applied. In this study, an anodized AZ91 alloy was coated with a polymer matrix composite made of polycaprolactone/chitosan (PCL/Ch) with different percentages of baghdadite to improve its resistance to corrosion, bioactivity, and biocompatibility. The effects of different percentages of baghdadite (0 wt %, 1 wt %, 3 wt %, and 5 wt %) on the surface microstructure, corrosion resistance, roughness, and wettability were evaluated. The results indicated that the applied nano-polymer-ceramic coating including 3 wt % baghdadite was hydrophobic, which consequently increased the corrosion resistance and decreased the corrosion current density of the anodized AZ91 alloy. Coating with 3 wt % baghdadite increased the roughness of AZ91 from 0.329 ± 0.02 to 7.026 ± 0.31 μm. After applying the polymer-ceramic coating on the surface of anodized AZ91, the corrosion products changed into calcium–phosphate compounds instead of Mg(OH)2, which is more stable in a physiological environment.","Soleymani, Farzad; Emadi, Rahmatollah; Sadeghzade, Sorour; Tavangarian, Fariborz",2019,Coatings,polycaprolactone; coating; Mg alloy; chitosan; baghdadite,10.3390/coatings9120789,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings9120789
Erosion Resistance and Damage Mechanism of TiN/ZrN Nanoscale Multilayer Coating,"Ceramic coating is an effective method for improving the erosion resistance of a material, particularly for titanium alloys. In this study, a TiN/ZrN (ceramic/ceramic) nanoscale multilayer coating is designed and prepared on the Ti6Al4V titanium alloy surface by the physical vapor deposition (PVD) process. The cross-sectional microstructure and phase composition are measured using SEM and XRD, respectively. The hardness, elastic modulus, and adhesion of the coating are measured by the nano-indentation and scratch method. The erosion test is conducted at a 45° angle with 100 m/s velocity using self-developed erosion equipment. The erosion resistance mechanisms of both the substrate and the coating are revealed more intuitively through a single sand particle impact test. The results show that the erosion resistance rate of the coating is 15.5 times higher than that of the titanium alloy substrate. The damage mechanisms of material removal of the coating include crack deflection, crack branching, and succeeding interaction between them when suffering an impacting load. These cracks are started from the droplets and the stress concentrations on the coating surface during the preparation of coating. They are the primary reasons for the decrease in the erosion resistance of the coating. This research is important for the optimization of the erosion-resistant coating structure.","Chen, Jiao; Geng, Mingrui; Li, Yuqin; Yang, Zhufang; Chai, Yan; He, Guangyu",2019,Coatings,TiN/ZrN nanoscale multilayer coating; sand erosion; erosion resistance; damage mechanism,10.3390/coatings9020064,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings9020064
Properties of Tool Steels and Their Importance When Used in a Coated System,"The introduction of new light-weight high-strength materials, which are difficult to form, increases demands on tool properties, including load-carrying capacity and wear resistance. Tool properties can be improved by the deposition of hard coatings but proper combination and optimization of the substrate properties are required to prepare the tool for coating application. The aim of this paper is to elaborate on tool steel substrate properties correlations, including hardness, fracture toughness, strength and surface quality and how these substrate properties influence on the coating performance. Results show that hardness of the steel substrate is the most influential parameter for abrasive wear resistance and load-carrying capacity, which is true for different types of hard coatings. However, high hardness should also be accompanied by sufficient fracture toughness, especially when it comes to very hard and brittle coatings, thus providing a combination of high load-carrying capacity, good fatigue properties and superior resistance against impact wear. Duplex treatment and formation of a compound layer during nitriding can be used as an additional support interlayer, but its brittleness may result in accelerated coating cracking and spallation if not supported by sufficient core hardness. In terms of galling resistance, even for coated surfaces substrate roughness and topography have major influence when it comes to hard ceramic coatings, with reduced substrate roughness and coating post-polishing providing up to two times better galling resistance.","Podgornik, Bojan; Sedlaček, Marko; Žužek, Borut; Guštin, Agnieszka",2020,Coatings,tool steel substrate; coatings; hardness; fracture toughness; load-carrying capacity; wear,10.3390/coatings10030265,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings10030265
Structure Investigation of Titanium Metallization Coating Deposited onto AlN Ceramics Substrate by Means of Friction Surfacing Process,"The article presents selected properties of a titanium metallization coating deposited on aluminum nitride (AlN) ceramics surface by means of the friction surfacing method. Its mechanism is based on the formation of a joint between the surface of an AlN ceramics substrate and a thin Ti coating, involving a kinetic energy of friction, which is directly converted into heat and delivered in a precisely defined quantity to the resulting joint. The largest effects on the final properties of the obtained coating include the high affinity of titanium for oxygen and nitrogen and a relatively high temperature for the deposition process. The titanium metallization coating was characterized in terms of surface stereometric structure, thickness, surface morphology, metallographic microstructural properties, and phase structure. The titanium coating has a thickness ranging from 3 to 7 μm. The phase structure of the coating surface (XPS investigated) is dominated by TiNxOy with the presence of TiOx, TiN, metallic Ti, and AlN. The phase structure deeper below the surface (XRD investigated) is dominated by metallic Ti with additional AlN particles originating from the ceramic substrate due to friction by titanium tools.","Chmielewski, Tomasz; Hudycz, Michał; Krajewski, Arkadiusz; Sałaciński, Tadeusz; Skowrońska, Beata; Świercz, Rafał",2019,Coatings,titanium coating; friction surfacing; metallization of AlN ceramics; phase structure,10.3390/coatings9120845,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings9120845
Composition versus Wear Behaviour of Air Plasma Sprayed NiCr–TiB2–ZrB2 Composite Coating,"The NiCr–TiB2–ZrB2 composite coating was deposited on the surface of blades made of steel (SUS304) using high-energy ball milling technology and air plasma spraying technology, which aimed to relieve the wear of the blades during operation. The influence of titanium diboride (TiB2) and zirconium diboride (ZrB2) on the microstructure and wear resistance of the coatings was investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Vickers microhardness tester, and a wear tester. The results showed that the TiB2 and ZrB2 particles were unevenly distributed in the coatings and significantly increased the hardness and anti-wear, which contributed to their ultra-high hardness and extremely strong ability to resist deformation. The performance of the coatings was improved with the increase of the number of ceramic phases, while the hardness and wear resistance of the coating could reach their highest value when the TiB2 and ZrB2 respectively took up 15 wt.% of the total mass of the powder.","Zhang, Ning; Zhang, Nannan; Guan, Sheng; Li, Shumei; Zhang, Guangwei; Zhang, Yue",2018,Coatings,TiB2; ZrB2; coating blade; anti-wear,10.3390/coatings8080273,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings8080273
Cold-Sprayed AZ91D Coating and SiC/AZ91D Composite Coatings,"As an emerging coating building technique, cold spraying has many advantages to elaborate Mg alloy workpieces. In this study, AZ91D coatings and AZ91D-based composite coatings were deposited using cold spraying. Coatings were prepared using different gas temperatures to obtain the available main gas temperature. Compressed air was used as the accelerating gas, and although magnesium alloy is oxidation-sensitive, AZ91D coatings with good performance were obtained. The results show that dense coatings can be fabricated until the gas temperature is higher than 500 °C. The deposition efficiency increases greatly with the gas temperature, but it is lower than 10% for all coating specimens. To analyze the effects of compressed air on AZ91D powder particles and the effects of gas temperature on coatings, the phase composition, porosity, cross-sectional microstructure, and microhardness of coatings were characterized. X-ray diffraction and oxygen content analysis clarified that no phase transformation or oxidation occurred on AZ91D powder particles during cold spraying processes with compressed air. The porosity of AZ91D coatings remained between 3.6% and 3.9%. Impact melting was found on deformed AZ91D particles when the gas temperature increased to 550 °C. As-sprayed coatings exhibit much higher microhardness than as-casted bulk magnesium, demonstrating the dense structure of cold-sprayed coatings. To study the effects of ceramic particles on cold-sprayed AZ91D coatings, 15 vol % SiC powder particles were added into the feedstock powder. Lower SiC content in the coating than in the feedstock powder means that the deposition efficiency of the SiC powder particles is lower than the deposition efficiency of AZ91D particles. The addition of SiC particles reduces the porosity and increases the microhardness of cold-sprayed AZ91D coatings. The corrosion behavior of AZ91D coating and SiC reinforced AZ91D composite coating were examined. The SiC-reinforced AZ91D composite coating reveals higher corrosion potential than magnesium substrate; therefore, it serves as a cathode for the magnesium substrate, the same as the AZ91D coating on magnesium substrate. As the SiC powder is semi-conductive, the embedded SiC particles reduce the electrochemical reaction of the AZ91D coating. The addition of SiC particles increases the corrosion potential of the coating, meanwhile increasing the galvanic potential and decreasing the negative galvanic current of the coating-substrate couple.","Wang, Yingying; Normand, Bernard; Suo, Xinkun; Planche, Marie-Pierre; Liao, Hanlin; Tang, Junlei",2018,Coatings,cold spraying; coating; magnesium alloy; composite coatings; corrosion; microstructure,10.3390/coatings8040122,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings8040122
Role of Phase Composition of PEO Coatings on AA2024 for In-Situ LDH Growth,"Plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) is an environmentally friendly anodizing technique leading to the formation of a ceramic-like coatings under high-voltage discharges. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) were grown directly on γ, α, and amorphous Al2O3 powders, respectively, in order to investigate the phase responsible for in-situ LDH growth on PEO coating. Furthermore, it is shown that LDH growth is limited by the high tortuosity of the PEO layer and the accessibility of      Al ( OH )  4 −     anions from the substrate covered with thin amorphous aluminum oxide, through the pores.","Serdechnova, Maria; Mohedano, Marta; Bouali, Anissa C",2017,Coatings,layered double hydroxides; plasma electrolytic oxidation; aluminum alloy,10.3390/coatings7110190,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings7110190
Thermal Stress Analysis of Environmental Barrier Coatings Considering Interfacial Roughness,"A numerical analysis of the effect of roughness interface on the thermal stress in the environmental barrier coatings for ceramic matrix composites was performed. Based on the concept of representative volume elements, a micromechanical finite element model of the coated composites was established. The rough interfaces between the coating layers were described using sine curves. The cooling process after preparation and the typical service conditions for the CMCs component were simulated, respectively. The results show that the rough interface has little effect on the temperature distribution along the depth direction for the studied T/EBC coatings for SiC/SiC composites. The stress concentration occurs at the rough EBC/BC interface, which is prone to cause delamination cracking. Under typical service conditions, the high temperature can eliminate part of the thermal residual stress. Meanwhile, the thermal gradient will cause large thermal stress in the TBC layer and the stress will result in surface cracks. The stress concentrations appear at the peaks and valleys of rough interfaces. The variation range of thermal stress increases with the roughness amplitude and decreases with the wavelength.","Fang, Guangwu; Ren, Jiacheng; Shi, Jian; Gao, Xiguang; Song, Yingdong",2020,Coatings,rough interface; ceramic matrix composite; environmental barrier coating; thermal stress; crack; finite element method,10.3390/coatings10100947,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings10100947
A Sinter Visualization Device for Observing the Relationship Between Fillers and Porosity of Precursor-Derived Ceramic Coatings,"Adding fillers to polysilazane (PSZ)-derived ceramic coating is one of the main methods used to reduce PSZ porosity. In this study, we designed a sinter visualization device for understanding the effect of fillers on coating porosity and observed pore evolution within the coating sintering process using different filler ratios. When there was no filler in the coating, gas evolution occurred at the initial sintering stage due to a PSZ pyrolysis reaction. In the final stage, numerous cracks appeared because of volume shrinkage. It was determined that such coatings cannot provide good protection. Although the cracks disappeared after adding glass powder, many bubbles appeared. After adding ZrO2, the bubbles in the coating significantly reduced. When the volume ratio of PSZ/glass powder/ZrO2 was 1:2:1, the coating porosity after sintering was the lowest. Based on our visualization experimental results, we concluded that the glass powder’s healing effect and the ZrO2 skeleton effect were the main reasons for the reduced coating porosity. In addition, the sinter visualization device can be used to observe the surface morphology of other similar coatings during the sintering processes.","Wang, Guangxin; Wang, Jinqing; Wang, Jie; Chi, Zuohe; Zhang, Guangxue; Zhou, Zhiyi; Feng, Zhi; Xiong, Yunhao",2020,Coatings,precursor-derived ceramic coatings; polysilazane; filler; visualization; porosity; SEM,10.3390/coatings10060552,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings10060552
Process and Formulation Strategies to Improve Adhesion of Nanoparticulate Coatings on Stainless Steel,"The use of ceramic nanoparticles in coatings can significantly improve their mechanical properties such as hardness, adhesion to substrate, and scratch and abrasion resistance. A successful enhancement of these properties depends strongly on the coating formulation used, and the subsequent structure formed during coating. The aim of the present work was to enhance the adhesion between nanoparticulate coatings and stainless-steel substrates. A covalent particle structure was formed and better mechanical properties were achieved by modifying alumina nanoparticles, as well as substrates, with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane and by using a formulation consisting of solvent, modified particles, and bisphenol-A-diglycidylether as cross-linking additive. In addition to the adhesion force needed to remove the coating from the substrate, the type of failure (adhesive or cohesive) was characterized to gain a deeper understanding of the structure formation and to identify interdependencies between process, formulation, and coating structure properties. The modification process and the formulation composition were varied to achieve a detailed conception of the relevant correlations. By relating the results to other structural properties, such as the theoretical porosity and thickness, it was possible to understand the formation of the coating structure in more detail.","Hesselbach, Jutta; Böttcher, Ann-Christin; Kampen, Ingo; Garnweitner, Georg; Schilde, Carsten; Kwade, Arno",2018,Coatings,alumina; nanoparticles; cross-linking; formulation; coating adhesion,10.3390/coatings8050156,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings8050156
Semitransparent Decorative Coatings Based on Optical Interference of Metallic and Dielectric Thin Films for High Temperature Applications,"This paper introduces a thin film multilayer structure composed of dielectric and metallic layers that allows for a wide range of aesthetic appearances using the phenomenon of optical interference. In addition, this multilayer structure allows the reflection and transmission coefficients to be controlled independently. The application of these decorative coatings to induction stoves is also studied. The aim is to provide an attractive aesthetic appearance for the transparent glass-ceramic, and allow the visualization of blue and white lighting systems. Moreover, degradation of these decorative coatings is studied at high temperatures, so as to ensure that the coating does not change its aesthetic appearance during normal operation of the stove. It has been found to be necessary to use dielectric materials with low diffusion coefficients of oxygen, or not containing oxygen, to prevent oxidation of the metal layers when subjecting the coating to high temperatures.","Carretero, Enrique; Alonso, Rafael",2018,Coatings,decorative coatings; DC pulsed magnetron sputtering; optical interference; thin films; induction cookers,10.3390/coatings8050183,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings8050183
Preparation of Metal Coatings on Steel Balls Using Mechanical Coating Technique and Its Process Analysis,"We successfully applied mechanical coating technique to prepare Ti coatings on the substrates of steel balls and stainless steel balls. The prepared samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The weight increase of the ball substrates and the average thickness of Ti coatings were also monitored. The results show that continuous Ti coatings were prepared at different revolution speeds after different durations. Higher revolution speed can accelerate the formation of continuous Ti coatings. Substrate hardness also markedly affected the formation of Ti coatings. Specifically, the substance with lower surface hardness was more suitable as the substrate on which to prepare Ti coatings. The substrate material plays a key role in the formation of Ti coatings. Specifically, Ti coatings formed more easily on metal/alloy balls than ceramic balls. The above conclusion can also be applied to other metal or alloy coatings on metal/alloy and ceramic substrates.","Hao, Liang; Yoshida, Hiroyuki; Itoi, Takaomi; Lu, Yun",2017,Coatings,Ti coatings; steel balls; mechanical coating; process analysis,10.3390/coatings7040053,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings7040053
TiBCN-Ceramic-Reinforced Ti-Based Coating by Laser Cladding: Analysis of Processing Conditions and Coating Properties,"In this paper, TiBCN-ceramic-reinforced Ti-based coating was fabricated on a Ti6Al4V substrate surface by laser cladding. The correlations between the main processing parameters and the geometrical characteristics of single clad tracks were predicted by linear regression analysis. On this basis, the microstructure, microhardness, corrosion resistance, and wear resistance of the coating and the substrate were investigated. The results showed that the clad height, clad width, clad depth, and dilution rate depended mainly on the laser power, the powder feeding rate, and the scanning speed. TiBCN-ceramic-reinforced Ti-based coating was mainly composed of directional dendritic TiBCN phases, equiaxed TiN phases, needle-like Al3Ti phases, and Ti phases. The microhardness gradually increased from the bottom to the top of the coating. The highest microhardness of coating was 1025 HV, which was three times higher than that of the Ti6Al4V substrate (350 HV). Furthermore, the coating exhibited excellent corrosion resistance and wear resistance. The corrosion potential (Ecorr) reached −1.258 V, and the corrosion density (Icorr) was 4.035 × 10−5 A/cm2, which was one order lower than that of the Ti6Al4V substrate (1.172 × 10−4 A/cm2). The coating wear mass loss was 4.35 mg, which was about two-third of the wear mass loss of the Ti6Al4V substrate (6.71 mg).","Li, Yuxin; Zhang, Pengfei; Bai, Peikang; Su, Keqiang; Su, Hongwen",2019,Coatings,laser cladding; geometrical characteristics; microstructure; microhardness; corrosion resistance; wear resistance,10.3390/coatings9060407,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings9060407
Hot Corrosion Resistance of Laser-Sealed Thermal-Sprayed Cermet Coatings,"Hot corrosion affects the components of diesel engines and gas turbines working at high temperatures, in the presence of low-melting salts and oxides, such as sodium sulfate and vanadium oxide. Thermal-sprayed coatings of nickel–chromium-based alloys reinforced with ceramic phases, can improve the hot corrosion and erosion resistance of exposed metals, and a sealing thermal, post-treatment can prove effective in reducing the permeability of aggressive species. In this study, the effect of purposely-optimized high-power diode laser reprocessing on the microstructure and type II hot corrosion resistance of cermet coatings of various compositions was investigated. Three different coatings were produced by high velocity oxy-fuel and was tested in the presence of a mixture of Na2SO4 and V2O5 at 700 °C, for up to 200 h: (i) Cr3C2–25% NiCr, (ii) Cr3C2–25% CoNiCrAlY, and (iii) mullite nano–silica–60% NiCr. Results evidenced that laser sealing was not effective in modifying the mechanism, on the basis of the hot corrosion degradation but could provide a substantial increase of the surface hardness and a significant decrease of the overall coating material consumption rate (coating recession), induced by the high temperature corrosive attack.","Baiamonte, Lidia; Bartuli, Cecilia; Marra, Francesco; Gisario, Annamaria; Pulci, Giovanni",2019,Coatings,type II hot corrosion; diode laser; sealing; thermal spray; HVOF; cermet,10.3390/coatings9060347,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings9060347
Development of Vitroceramic Coatings and Analysis of Their Suitability for Biomedical Applications,"Within the field of tissue engineering, thin films have been studied to improve implant fixation of metallic or ceramic materials in bone, connective tissue, oral mucosa or skin. In this context, to enhance their suitability as implantable devices, titanium-based substrates received a superficial vitroceramic coating by means of laser ablation. Further, this study describes the details of fabrication and corresponding tests in order to demonstrate the bioactivity and biocompatibility of the newly engineered surfaces. Thus, the metallic supports were covered with a complex material composed of SiO2, P2O5, CaO, MgO, ZnO and CaF2, in the form of thin layers via a physical deposition techniques, namely pulsed laser deposition. The resulting products were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, selected area electron diffraction, and electron energy loss spectroscopy. It was found that a higher substrate temperature and a lower working pressure lead to the highest quality film. Finally, the samples biocompatibility was assessed and they were found to be bioactive after simulated body fluid soaking and biocompatible through the MTT cell viability test.","Jinga, Sorin-Ion; Skokin, Michael; Vasile, Bogdan-Stefan; Constantinoiu, Izabela; Miu, Dana; Bacalum, Mihaela; Busuioc, Cristina",2019,Coatings,vitroceramic; coatings; pulsed laser deposition; bioactivity; metallic implants,10.3390/coatings9100671,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings9100671
Influence of Silicon-Modified Al Powders (SiO2@Al) on Anti-oxidation Performance of Al2O3-SiO2 Ceramic Coating for Carbon Steel at High Temperature,"In this paper, silicon-modified Al powders (SiO2@Al) were prepared by tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) hydrolysis under alkaline conditions. Using SiO2@Al as additives, a new Al2O3-SiO2 ceramic coating (ASMA) was formed on carbon steel to prevent carbon steel from oxidization at 1250 °C for 120 min. Compared with the Al2O3-SiO2 ceramic coating without additive (AS), ASMA showed a remarkably better anti-oxidation performance, especially during the temperature-rise period. According to the characterization conducted by TG-DTA, XRD and SEM-EDS, it was found that the metallic Al in ASMA melted at 660 °C and reacted with SiO2 on its surface, which generated local high temperature and accelerated the sintering of ceramic raw materials. The mullite and hercynite formed in ASMA also played a major role for enhancing the anti-oxidation performance of ceramic coating.","Yu, Bo; Fu, Guoyan; Cui, Yanbin; Zhang, Xiaomeng; Tu, Yubo;  Du, Yingchao; Zuo, Gaohong; Ye, Shufeng; Wei, Lianqi",2019,Coatings,ceramic coating; anti-oxidation; SiO2@Al additive; carbon steel,10.3390/coatings9030167,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings9030167
Al2O3 + Graphene Low-Friction Composite Coatings Prepared By Sol–Gel Method,"In this work, Al2O3 + graphene coatings were prepared using the sol–gel method. The aim of the study was preliminary determination of the influence of size and amount of graphene nanoplatelets on morphology, chemical structure, and basic tribological properties of Al2O3 + graphene composite coatings. Two types of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanoplatelets with different lateral size and thickness were used to prepare the coatings. To characterize them, scanning electron microscope (SEM), glow discharged optical emission spectrometer (GDOES), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), reflectance spectrometer, and ball-on-disk tribological tests were used. It was found that the presence of graphene in the Al2O3 + graphene coatings did not fundamentally change the chemical transformation of ceramic Al2O3 matrix. Morphology examinations of coatings containing larger graphene nanoplatelets revealed a tendency to their parallel arrangement in relation to the coated surface. The tribological properties of Al2O3 + graphene coatings turned out to be strongly dependent on the size of graphene nanoplatelets as well as on the heat treatment temperature. The friction coefficient as low as 0.11 and good durability were obtained for the Al2O3 + graphene coating with larger nanoplatelets and heat-treated at 500 °C. The results of conducted research indicate the potential use of Al2O3 + graphene composite coatings prepared by the sol–gel method as low-friction ceramic coatings.","Pietrzyk, Bożena; Miszczak, Sebastian; Sun, Ye; Szymański, Marcin",2020,Coatings,ceramic coating; alumina coating; sol–gel; composite coating; graphene oxide; graphene nanoplatelets (GNP); rGO,10.3390/coatings10090858,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings10090858
Environmental Barrier Coatings Made by Different Thermal Spray Technologies,"Environmental barrier coatings (EBCs) are essential to protect ceramic matrix composites against water vapor recession in typical gas turbine environments. Both oxide and non-oxide-based ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) need such coatings as they show only a limited stability. As the thermal expansion coefficients are quite different between the two CMCs, the suitable EBC materials for both applications are different. In the paper examples of EBCs for both types of CMCs are presented. In case of EBCs for oxide-based CMCs, the limited strength of the CMC leads to damage of the surface if standard grit-blasting techniques are used. Only in the case of oxide-based CMCs different processes as laser ablation have been used to optimize the surface topography. Another result for many EBCs for oxide-based CMC is the possibility to deposit them by standard atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) as crystalline coatings. Hence, in case of these coatings only the APS process will be described. For the EBCs for non-oxide CMCs the state-of-the-art materials are rare earth or yttrium silicates. Here the major challenge is to obtain dense and crystalline coatings. While for the Y2SiO5 a promising microstructure could be obtained by a heat-treatment of an APS coating, this was not the case for Yb2Si2O7. Here also other thermal spray processes as high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF), suspension plasma spraying (SPS), and very low-pressure plasma spraying (VLPPS) are used and the results described mainly with respect to crystallinity and porosity.","Vaßen, Robert; Bakan, Emine; Gatzen, Caren; Kim, Seongwong; Mack, Daniel E",2019,Coatings,environmental barrier coatings; thermal spray methods; atmospheric plasma spraying; suspension plasma spraying; very low-pressure plasma spraying; high velocity oxygen fuel spraying,10.3390/coatings9120784,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings9120784
A Dense Cr2O3/Al2O3 Composite Ceramic Coating Prepared by Electrodeposition and Sealing with Al2O3,"A dense Cr2O3/Al2O3 composite coating was fabricated on 321L stainless steel by electrodepositing an Al2O3 layer on a Cr2O3 coating. The composition, structure, and properties of the obtained ceramic coating were investigated. The results showed that Al2O3 fully infiltrated the Cr2O3 coating and significantly improved the compactness of the ceramic coating by filling in the pores and cracks between the Cr2O3 grains. The composite ceramic coating was heat-treated at 750 °C and exhibited a high microhardness of 219.4 HV500g, a bonding strength of 46.5 MPa, and excellent anti-corrosion and deuterium permeation suppression properties.","Di, Jiao; Liu, Wei; Xue, Lihong; Zhou, Qilai; Yan, Youwei",2019,Coatings,Cr2O3/Al2O3 composite coating; electrodeposition; bonding strength; corrosion resistance; deuterium permeation,10.3390/coatings9010014,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings9010014
Microwave-Assisted Dip Coating of Aloe Vera on Metallocene Polyethylene Incorporated with Nano-Rods of Hydroxyapaptite for Bone Tissue Engineering,"Bone tissue engineering widely explores the use of ceramic reinforced polymer-matrix composites. Among the various widely-used ceramic reinforcements, hydroxyapatite is an undisputed choice due to its inherent osteoconductive nature. In this study, a novel nanocomposite comprising metallocene polyethylene (mPE) incorporated with nano-hydroxyapaptite nanorods (mPE-nHA) was synthesized and dip coated with Aloe vera after subjecting it to microwave treatment. The samples were characterized using contact angle, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and 3D Hirox microscopy scanning. Contact angle results show that the hydrophilicity of mPE-nHA improved notably with the coating of Aloe vera. The surface topology and increase in surface roughness were observed using the SEM, AFM and 3D Hirox microscopy. Blood compatibility assays of pure mPE and the Aloe vera coated nanocomposite were performed. The prothrombin time (PT) was delayed by 1.06% for 24 h Aloe-vera-treated mPE-nHA compared to the pristine mPE-nHA. Similarly, the 24 h Aloe-vera-coated mPE-nHA nanocomposite prolonged the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) by 41 s against the control of pristine mPE-nHA. The hemolysis percentage was also found to be the least for the 24 h Aloe-vera-treated mPE-nHA which was only 0.2449% compared to the pristine mPE-nHA, which was 2.188%. To conclude, this novel hydroxyapatite-reinforced, Aloe-vera-coated mPE with a better mechanical and anti-thrombogenic nature may hold a great potential to be exploited for bone tissue engineering applications.","Wang, Hairong; Zhang, Xueliang; Mani, Mohan P",2017,Coatings,metallocene polyethylene; hydroxyapatite nanorods; Aloe vera coating; bone tissue engineering,10.3390/coatings7110182,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings7110182
Microstructure and Properties of M3B2-Type Boride-Based Cermet Coatings Prepared by Laser Cladding Synthesis,"Although Q235 steel materials are widely used in offshore engineering, the service life is severely shortened by its inferior resistance to wear and corrosion in harsh marine working environments. Boride-based cermet composites could be a good surface-protective coating to enhance surface hardness, wear resistance, and corrosion resistance. M3B2 (M: Mo, Ni, Fe, Cr) boride-based cermet coatings composed of hard ceramics of M3B2-type complex borides and an {Fe, Ni} metal matrix was fabricated on Q235 steels with mixed Mo, Cr, B, and Ni60 powders using a laser cladding synthesis technique. The influences of laser cladding parameters on the microstructure, phase composition, microhardness, and corrosion resistance of the coatings were comprehensively investigated. Results showed that the microstructures of the coatings mainly consisted of three layers, which were, from the top to bottom layer, a metal layer with fewer ceramic phases, a ceramic layer with fewer metal phases, and another metal layer with fewer ceramic phases. The ceramic phases were mainly M3B2-type borides, and the metal phases were mainly {Fe, Ni} alloys. The appearance of Fe-enriching metal phases was due to the supply of Fe elements from Q235 substrates. With squash pretreatment and without a remelting aftertreatment, ceramics uniformly dispersed in the cermet coatings, and their sizes decreased. The results of microhardness showed that the microhardness of the coating first increased and then decreased from the top layer to the bottom layer, and maximum microhardness was obtained in the layer of ceramics with less metal phases. An electrochemical corrosion test showed that the cermet coatings (jcorr = 6.35 μA/cm2) could improve the corrosion resistance of Q235 steels (j = 43.76 μA/cm2) by one order of magnitude.","Hu, Zhaowei; Li, Wenge; Zhao, Yuantao",2019,Coatings,boride-based cermet; laser cladding synthesis; hardness; corrosion resistance,10.3390/coatings9080476,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings9080476
Microstructure and Tribological Performance of TiB2-NiCr Composite Coating Deposited by APS,"Nickel chromium (NiCr) powders with different titanium diboride (TiB2) additions (20, 40 and 60 wt %) were prepared with a mechanical alloying method and then sprayed using an air plasma spraying technology. The microstructure and phase composite of the powders and the cross-sections of deposited coatings were analyzed with a scanning electronic microscope and X-ray diffraction. The tribological performance of the coatings was studied using a pin-on-disk tribometer at room temperature. The weight loss of the as-sprayed coating was measured by using a high accuracy weighing balance. Cr3C2-25NiCr coating was produced and tested for comparison. The morphologies of the worn surface were then investigated. Parts of debris with some scratches were found, presenting typical signs of abrasive wear and showing slight adhesive wear on the surface. The 20 wt % additive TiB2 coating demonstrated the highest microhardness and the lowest coefficient of friction. The wear resistance of the metal-ceramic composites coatings was enhanced with the addition of TiB2.","Zhang, Ning; Zhang, Nannan; Wei, Xufeng; Zhang, Yue; Li, Deyuan",2017,Coatings,TiB2-NiCr; air plasma spray; mechanical alloying; tribological property,10.3390/coatings7120238,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings7120238
Fabrication and Characterization of Ceramic Coating on Al7075 Alloy by Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation in Molten Salt,"The fabrication of a ceramic coating on the metallic substrate is usually applied to achieve the improved performance of the material. Plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) is one of the most promising methods to reach this performance, mostly wear and corrosion resistance. Traditional PEO is carried out in an aqueous electrolyte. However, the current work showed the fabrication and characterization of a ceramic coating using PEO in molten salt which was used to avoid disadvantages in system heating-up and the formation of undesired elements in the coating. Aluminum 7075 alloy was subjected to the surface treatment using PEO in molten nitrate salt. Various current frequencies were applied in the process. Coating investigations revealed its surface porous structure and the presence of two oxide layers, α-Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3. Microhardness measurements and chemical and phase examinations confirmed these results. Potentiodynamic polarization tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed the greater corrosion resistance for the coated alloy. Moreover, the corrosion resistance was increased with the current frequency of the PEO process.","Sobolev, Alexander; Peretz, Tamar; Borodianskiy, Konstantin",2020,Coatings,plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO); Al7075 alloy; aluminum oxide; molten salt; microhardness; corrosion resistance,10.3390/coatings10100993,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings10100993
"Investigation on Microstructure, Hardness, and Corrosion Resistance of Mo–Ni–B Coatings Prepared by Laser Cladding Technique","The hard and corrosion resistant coatings of Mo2NiB2 cermet were prepared by the laser cladding technique. The influences of the Mo:B ratio and the laser scanning speed on the microstructure and property of the Mo2NiB2 cermet coatings were investigated. The results showed that the laser scanning speed of 1.5 mm/s and the Mo:B ratio of 1 were more beneficial to the formation of Mo2NiB2 cermet than 2.0 mm/s and 0.8, 1.2, respectively. The amount of the Mo2NiB2 ceramic phases were decreased from the top layer to the bottom layer of the coating. The changes of microstructure and composition led to the changes of hardness and corrosion resistance of the Mo2NiB2 cermet coatings. The coating prepared at the Mo:B ratio of 1 and the scanning speed of 1.5 mm/s possessed the highest hardness, and the hardness gradually decreased from the top layer to the bottom layer of the coating. The formation of Mo2NiB2 and {FeM} phases led to the enhanced corrosion resistance of the Mo2NiB2 cermet coatings, and the coating prepared at the Mo:B ratio of 0.8 possessed the best corrosion resistance and the minimum corrosion current.","Ni, Xiaojie; Wang, Shengze; Zhao, Yuantao; Li, Wenge; Jiao, Xiong",2019,Coatings,laser cladding synthesis; Mo2NiB2 cermet coating; microstructure; hardness; corrosion resistance,10.3390/coatings9120856,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings9120856
The Role of Thin-Film Vacuum-Plasma Coatings and Their Influence on the Efficiency of Ceramic Cutting Inserts,"The main problem with ceramics used in cutting tools is related to the unpredictable failures caused by the brittle fracturing of ceramic inserts, which is critical for the intermittent milling of cyclic loading. A 125-mm-diameter eight-toothed end mill, with a mechanical fastening of ceramic inserts, was used as a cutting tool for milling hardened steel (102Cr6). For the experiments, square inserts of the Al2O3 + SiC ceramic were used and compared with the samples made of Al2O3 + TiC to confirm the obtained results. The samples were coated with diamond-like coating (DLC), TiZrN, and TiCrAlN coatings, and their bending strength and adhesion were investigated. Investigations into the friction coefficient of the samples and operational tests were also carried out. The effect of smoothing the microroughness and surface defects in comparison with uncoated inserts, which are characteristic of the abrasive processing of ceramics, was investigated and analyzed. The process developed by the authors of the coating process allows for the cleaning and activation of the surface of ceramic inserts using high-energy gas atoms. The impact of these particles on the cutting edge of the insert ensures its sharpening and reduces the radius of curvature of its cutting edges.","Volosova, Marina; Grigoriev, Sergey; Metel, Alexander; Shein, Alexander",2018,Coatings,vacuum-plasma coatings; thin films; ceramics; cutting tool; cutting inserts; wear resistance; strength characteristics; surface defects; abrasive processing,10.3390/coatings8080287,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings8080287
Effect of Al-B2O3-TiO2 Exothermic System on Performances of Fly Ash Glass/Ceramic Composite Coating,"Glass/ceramic composite coatings were prepared on 40Cr steel matrix by thermo-chemical reaction with fly ash and a small amount of SiO2, Al2O3, MgO, and albite as main raw materials. On this basis, adding 10% Al-TiO2-B2O3 exothermic system, the morphology, phase, thermal shock resistance, and corrosion resistance of the coating were tested, and the influence of exothermic system on the structure and properties of the composite coating was studied. The experimental results show that the addition of exothermic system can promote the formation of NaB15, TiB2, Na2B4O7, Ca2Al2SiO7, and other new phases by thermo-chemical reaction; when compared to the composite coating without addition of exothermic system, combined with a good interface, higher compactness, and lower porosity. The highest micro hardness can be reached 725HV0.1. The number of thermal shock from 700 °C to room temperature can reach more than 50 times; acid, salt, oil immersion corrosion test, composite coating with exothermic system relative to the matrix increased by 27.40 times, 3.97 times, and 1.88 times, respectively. The overall performance is better than that of the composite coating without exothermic system.","An, Yajun; Li, Weiqiang; Zhu, Li; Lu, Jingjing; Liu, Xianyang",2018,Coatings,fly ash; 40Cr; exothermic system; properties analysis; thermal shock resistance,10.3390/coatings8010036,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings8010036
Comparative Effectiveness of Multiple Laser Scanning and Conventional Techniques on Zirconia Shear Bond Strength,"This study aimed to compare the impact of different laser scanning with that of conventional methods on zirconia surface treatment through evaluation of shear bond strength (SBS) values. One hundred and thirty-two sintered zirconia cubic-samples were prepared and randomly divided into six study groups: milling control (without surface treatment); grinding; sandblasting; and three-times, four-times, and five-times laser scanning groups. The treatment process for the first three groups was performed before the zirconia coating, while the last three groups were treated after zirconia coating with veneer slurry through a spraying technique. In the current study, the surface roughness Ra, contact angle measurement, phase transformation, topography and interfaces, SBS in unaged and aged conditions, and fracture mode patterns of zirconia cores were investigated. The results were analyzed using laser confocal scanning microscopy, drop analyzer, X-ray diffractometry (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), universal testing machine and stereomicroscope. The results indicated that three-times laser scanned specimens presented higher Ra values than the other studied groups. The minimum contact angle value was detected in the mentioned group, while the control group presented the highest value. The XRD showed phase transformation from tetragonal to monoclinic t–m following grinding and sandblasting. However, the laser scanned specimens and the control group preserved the structural integrity of the zirconia core, presenting the tetragonal phase only. The highest SBS values were recorded in specimens treated with three-times laser scanning in the unaged and aged conditions. A mixed fracture was a common fracture pattern among the studied groups. The results confirmed that SBS could be optimized through three-times laser scanning and it provided better adhesion between zirconia and the veneer ceramic material. Multiple scanning processes of more than three times are not recommended for zirconia surface treatment.","Abdullah, Adil O",2019,Coatings,shear bond strength SBS; surface treatment; veneer ceramic; laser scanning; laser confocal microscopy,10.3390/coatings9070422,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings9070422
Laser Cladding of Ti-Based Ceramic Coatings on Ti6Al4V Alloy: Effects of CeO2 Nanoparticles Additive on Wear Performance,"Ti-based ceramic coatings on Ti6Al4V substrates were successfully prepared through a laser cladding process using pre-placed starting materials of TiCN + SiO2 mixed powder without or with adding a 3 wt % CeO2 nanoparticles additive, aiming at improving the wear resistance of the Ti6Al4V alloy for biological applications. The effects of the CeO2 nanoparticles additive on the microstructure, microhardness, and wear performance of the coatings were analyzed in detail. The observations showed that the main compositions of the cladding coating were TiCN and TiN phase. Compared to the coatings without CeO2, the coatings modified with CeO2 nanoparticles led to more excellent mechanical properties. The average microhardness of the coatings modified with CeO2 nanoparticles was approximately 1230 HV0.2, and the wear volume loss of the coatings modified with CeO2 nanoparticles was approximately 14% less than that of the coatings without CeO2 under a simulated body fluid (SBF) lubrication environment. The major reasons included that the microstructure of the coatings modified with CeO2 nanoparticles was refined and compact granular crystalline. The wear mechanisms of the coatings were investigated from the worn surface of the coatings, wear debris, and the worn surface of the counter-body balls. The wear mechanisms of the coatings without CeO2 included abrasive wear, adhesive wear, and fatigue wear, while the wear mechanisms of the coatings modified with CeO2 nanoparticles included only abrasive wear and adhesive wear, because the fine microstructure of the coatings had an excellent resistance to fatigue wear.","Wang, Haojun; Chen, Tao; Cong, Weilong; Liu, Defu",2019,Coatings,Ti-based ceramic coating; laser cladding; CeO2 nanoparticles; microstructure; wear performance,10.3390/coatings9020109,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings9020109
Cavitation Erosion Resistance and Wear Mechanism Model of Flame-Sprayed Al2O3-40%TiO2/NiMoAl Cermet Coatings,"This manuscript deals with the cavitation erosion resistance of flame-sprayed Al2O3-40%TiO2/NiMoAl cermet coatings (low-velocity oxy-fuel (LVOF)), a new functional application of cermet coatings. The aim of the study was to investigate the cavitation erosion mechanism and determine the effect of feedstock powder ratio (Al2O3-TiO2/NiMoAl) of LVOF-sprayed cermet coatings on their cavitation erosion resistance. As-sprayed coatings were investigated for roughness, porosity, hardness, and Young’s modulus. Microstructural characteristics of the cross section and the surface of as-sprayed coatings were examined by light optical microscopy (LOM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) methods. Coating cavitation tests were conducted in accordance with the ASTM G32 standard using an alternative stationary specimen testing method with usage of reference samples made from steel, copper, and aluminum alloys. Cavitation erosion resistance was measured by weight and volume loss, and normalised cavitation erosion resistance was calculated. Surface eroded due to cavitation was examined in successive time intervals by LOM and SEM-EDS. On the basis of coating properties and cavitation investigations, a phenomenological model of the cavitation erosion of Al2O3-40%TiO2/NiMoAl cermet coatings was elaborated. General relationships between their properties, microstructure, and cavitation wear resistance were established. The Al2O3-40%TiO2/NiMoAl composite coating containing 80% ceramic powder has a higher cavitation erosion resistance than the reference aluminium alloy.","Szala, Mirosław; Hejwowski, Tadeusz",2018,Coatings,cermet coating; aluminia–titania; thermal spraying; flame spraying; cavitation erosion; microstructure; wear model,10.3390/coatings8070254,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings8070254
Preparation and Characterization of Sprayed-Yttrium Oxyfluoride Corrosion Protective Coating for Plasma Process Chambers,"This study investigates the microstructure, mechanical and electrical properties of dense yttrium oxyfluoride (YOF) coatings fabricated by the atmospheric plasma spraying technique. Transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis revealed a well crystallized YOF coating with preferred orientations. The YOF coatings were more porous (approximate porosity 0.5%), with higher hardness (290 ± 30 HV), lower electrical resistivity (1016 Ω⋅cm), and breakdown voltage (5.57 kV), than conventional yttrium-fluoride plasma-protective coating. These results indicate the potential of the YOF coating as a novel antiplasma and corrosion-resistant ceramic.","Lin, Tzu-Ken; Wuu, Dong-Sing; Huang, Shih-Yung; Wang, Wei-Kai",2018,Coatings,yttrium oxyfluoride (YOF); atmospheric plasma spraying (APS); plasma processing equipment,10.3390/coatings8100373,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings8100373
Studies on Preparation and Characterization of Aluminum Nitride-Coated Carbon Fibers and Thermal Conductivity of Epoxy Matrix Composites,In this work; the effects of an aluminum nitride (AlN) ceramic coating on the thermal conductivity of carbon fiber-reinforced composites were studied. AlN were synthesized by a wet-thermal treatment (WTT) method in the presence of copper catalysts. The WTT method was carried out in a horizontal tube furnace at above 1500 °C under an ammonia (NH3) gas atmosphere balanced by a nitrogen using aluminum chloride as a precursor. Copper catalysts pre-doped enhance the interfacial bonding of the AlN with the carbon fiber surfaces. They also help to introduce AlN bonds by interrupting aluminum oxide (Al2O3) formation in combination with oxygen. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM); Transmission electron microscopy (TEM); and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to analyze the carbon fiber surfaces and structures at each step (copper-coating step and AlN formation step). In conclusion; we have demonstrated a synthesis route for preparing an AlN coating on the carbon fiber surfaces in the presence of a metallic catalyst.,"Kim, Hyeon-Hye; Lee, Youn-Sik; Chung, Dong C",2017,Coatings,aluminum nitride (AlN); carbon fibers; copper catalyst; composites; thermal conductivity,10.3390/coatings7080121,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings7080121
Antibacterial Functionalization of PVD Coatings on Ceramics,"The application of surface treatments that incorporate silver or copper as antibacterial elements has become a common practice for a wide variety of medical devices and materials because of their effective activity against nosocomial infections. Ceramic tiles are choice materials for cladding the floors and walls of operation rooms and other hospital spaces. This study is focused on the deposition of biocide physical vapor deposition (PVD) coatings on glazed ceramic tiles. The objective was to provide antibacterial activity to the surfaces without worsening their mechanical properties. Silver and copper-doped chromium nitride (CrN) and titanium nitride (TiN) coatings were deposited on samples of tiles. A complete characterization was carried out in order to determine the composition and structure of the coatings, as well as their topographical and mechanical properties. The distribution of Ag and Cu within the coating was analyzed using glow discharge optical emission spectrometry (GD-OES) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). Roughness, microhardness, and scratch resistance were measured for all of the combinations of coatings and dopants, as well as their wettability. Finally, tests of antibacterial efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were carried out, showing that all of the doped coatings had pronounced biocide activity.","Osés, Javier; Fuentes, Gonzalo G",2018,Coatings,silver; copper; TiN; CrN; ceramic tiles,10.3390/coatings8050197,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings8050197
Preparation of Micro-Patterned CaMn7O12 Ceramic Films via a Photosensitive Sol-Gel Method,"Mn/acetylacetone chelate was synthesized using Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O as raw material, methanol as the solvent, and acetylacetone as the chelating agent. The ultraviolet (UV)-absorption peak of the synthesized chelate was found around 298 nm. CaMn7O12 sol was subsequently prepared using the Mn/AcAc chelate as the Mn source and calcium nitrate as the calcium source. The UV test indicates that the CaMn7O12 sol has the UV-sensitive characteristics. Owing to its photo-sensitivity, micro-patterned CaMn7O12 ceramic film can be prepared without photoresist, only through dip-coating, drying, UV-irradiation, solvent-washing, and heat treatment. The magnetic test result indicates that the micro-patterned CaMn7O12 ceramic film has a saturation magnetization of 112.8 emu/cm3, which is close to that of non-patterned CaMn7O12 ceramic film.","Wang, Yunwei; Zhao, Gaoyang; Wu, Chuanbao; Duan, Zongfan",2019,Coatings,CaMn7O12; multiferroic film; micro-pattern; sol-gel,10.3390/coatings9100650,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings9100650
Bioactivity Behavior Evaluation of PCL-Chitosan-Nanobaghdadite Coating on AZ91 Magnesium Alloy in Simulated Body Fluid,"Polymer–ceramic composite coatings on magnesium-based alloys have attracted lots of attention in recent years, to control the speed of degradability and to enhance bioactivity and biocompatibility. In this study, to decrease the corrosion rate in a simulated body fluid (SBF) solution for long periods, to control degradability, and to enhance bioactivity, polycaprolactone–chitosan composite coatings with different percentages of baghdadite (0 wt.%, 3 wt.%, and 5 wt.%) were applied to an anodized AZ91 alloy. According to the results of the immersion test of the composite coating containing 3 wt.% baghdadite in a phosphate buffer solution (PBS), the corrosion rate decreased from 0.45 (for the AZ91 sample) to 0.11 mg/cm2·h after seven days of immersion. To evaluate the apatite formation capability of specimens, samples were immersed in an SBF solution. The results showed that the samples were bioactive as apatite layers formed on the surface of specimens. The composite coating containing 3 wt.% baghdadite showed the highest apatite-formation capability, with a controlled release of ions, and the lowest corrosion rate in the SBF.","Soleymani, Farzad; Emadi, Rahmatollah; Sadeghzade, Sorour; Tavangarian, Fariborz",2020,Coatings,polycaprolactone; Mg alloy; chitosan; baghdadite; coating,10.3390/coatings10030231,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings10030231
Combustion Synthesis during Flame Spraying (“CAFSY”) for the Production of Catalysts on Substrates,"Combustion-assisted flame spraying (“CAFSY”) has been used to produce catalytically active nickel aluminide coatings on ceramic substrates. Their catalytic activity was studied in CO2 (dry) reforming of methane, which is particularly significant for environmental protection as well as production of synthesis gas (CO + H2). By varying the CAFSY processing parameters, it is possible to obtain a range of Ni–Al alloys with various ratios of catalytically active phases on the substrate. The influence of the number of coating layers and the type of substrate on the final catalyst composition and on the catalytic activity of the CAFSY coatings was studied and is presented here. The morphology and microstructure of the composite coatings were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific area analysis. Catalytic tests for dry reforming of methane were carried out using crushed pellets from the coatings at temperatures of 750–900 °C, and gas chromatography showed that methane conversion approached 88% whereas that of carbon dioxide reached 100%. The H2/CO ratio in the synthesis gas produced by the reaction varied from about 0.7 to over 1.2, depending on the catalyst and substrate type and testing temperature.","Xanthopoulou, Galina; Marinou, Amalia; Karanasios, Konstantinos; Vekinis, George",2017,Coatings,thermal spray coating; SHS; catalysts on substrates; dry reforming of methane; syngas,10.3390/coatings7010014,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings7010014
Influence of TiO2 Additives on Cavitation Erosion Resistance of Al-Mg Alloy Micro-Arc Oxidation Coating,"Four ceramic coatings are fabricated on 6061 aluminum alloy substrates with a micro-arc oxidation technique in silicate electrolytes with different TiO2 nano-additive concentrations. To explore the cavitation erosion resistance of the micro-arc oxidation (MAO) coating, cavitation tests are performed using a vibratory test rig. After cavitation tests lasting 10 min, the mass losses, surface morphologies, and chemical compositions of the samples after cavitation tests are examined using a digital balance, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), respectively. The results indicate that, in contrast to the aluminum alloy, the MAO coatings, by adjusting TiO2 nano-additive concentration, can decrease the mean depth of erosion rate (MDER) due to the cavitation damage, and lead to an excellent cavitation erosion resistance. The results also show that: In contrast to aluminum alloy, MAO coatings can decrease the MDER due to the cavitation damage in a short period of time by adjusting TiO2 nano-additive concentration. With the increase of TiO2 nano-additive concentration, the compactness and the surface hardness of MAO coatings decrease, which can easily lead to larger erosion pits.","Jiang, Hongyan; Cheng, Feng; Fang, Dianjun",2019,Coatings,TiO2 nano-additive; aluminum alloy; micro-arc oxidation coating; cavitation erosion resistance; pits,10.3390/coatings9080521,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings9080521
Influence of Different Electrolyte Additives and Structural Characteristics of Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation Coatings on AZ31 Magnesium Alloy,"Coatings prepared by different electrolyte additives were investigated on AZ31 magnesium alloy by plasma electrolytic oxidation. In this study, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis were employed to assess the morphologies, chemical and phase compositions of the plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) coatings, respectively. Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to evaluate the corrosion behavior of the composite coating. The investigation of the effect of electrolyte additives in the base electrolyte showed that the PEO specimens exhibit different surface and cross-sectional morphologies, and phase compositions. The results showed that SiO32− was conducive to the growth of the ceramic layer, and the ceramic layer developing in the electrolyte which contained AlO2− showed a typical double-layer structure. The corrosion resistance of coating formed in a phosphate bath was higher than that of the coating formed in silicate bath and coating formed in an aluminate bath. Moreover, the corrosion resistance of the coating formed in the fluoride bath was the highest.","Huang, Zhiquan; Wang, Ruiqiang; Liu, Xintong; Wang, Dongdong; Zhang, Heng; Shen, Xiaojie; Shen, Dejiu; Li, Dalong",2020,Coatings,magnesium alloy; plasma electrolytic oxidation; electrolyte additive; corrosion behavior,10.3390/coatings10090817,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings10090817
Characterization of Ceramics Coatings Processed by Sol-Gel for Cutting Tools,"In order to obtain better cutting tool performance, the coatings appear as an alternative in the machining process. The goal of the coating is to improve tribological conditions in the chip-tool and tool-workpiece interfaces. On the other hand, the use of coated tools decreases the wear of the tools. This study discusses the ceramic coatings characterization deposited in WC tools. The Al2O3 and TiO2 films present properties such as thermal stability, chemical inertia, high hardness, and good mechanical properties. These coatings were prepared by sol-gel technology. The results indicated that the multilayer coating presents better adhesion on the substrate. Moreover, lower coefficients of friction were found for the coated tools. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the influence of the cutting parameters and tool coating on the cutting force. The lower cutting force was obtained using the multilayer-coated tool. Thus, the sol-gel method appears as a novel technique to deposit coating in the WC tools to improve their performance.","Rezende, Bruna A",2019,Coatings,tools coatings; sol-gel; TiO2; Al2O3; cutting force,10.3390/coatings9110755,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings9110755
HA Coating on Ti6Al7Nb Alloy Using an Electrophoretic Deposition Method and Surface Properties Examination of the Resulting Coatings,"Ti and its alloys, which are commonly used in biomedical applications, are often preferred due to their proximity to the mechanical properties of bone. In order to increase the biocompatibility and bioactivities of these materials, biomaterials based on ceramic are used in coating operations. In this study, by using an electrophoretic deposition method, instead of on the Ti6Al4V alloy which is commonly used in the literature, a hydroxyapatite (HA) coating operation was applied on the surface of the Ti6Al7Nb alloy, and the surface properties of the coatings were examined. Ti6Al7Nb is a new-generation implant on which there have not been many studies. The voltage values which were used in the coating operation were 50, 100, 150 and 200 V, and the time parameter was stabilized at 1 min. In our method, when preparing the solution, HA, ethanol, and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were used. At the end of the study, by using an electron microscope (SEM) the microstructures of the coatings were examined; elemental analyses (EDS) of the coating surfaces were performed; and by using an X-radiation diffraction (XRD) method, the phases which the coatings contained and the concentration of these phases were determined, and the coating thickness, roughness, and hardness values were also determined. Also, by conducting a Scratch test, the strength of the surface combination was examined. At the end of the study, in each parameter, a successful HA coating was seen. By comparing parameters with each other, the ideal voltage value in this coating was determined. It was determined that the most suitable coating was obtained at 100 V voltage and 1 min deposition time.","Aydın, İbrahim; Bahçepınar, Ali İ",2019,Coatings,hydroxyapatite (HA); electrophoretic deposition (EPD); Ti6Al7Nb; coating; surface properties,10.3390/coatings9060402,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings9060402
Influences of Cr and Co on the Growth of Thermally Grown Oxide in Thermal Barrier Coating during High-Temperature Exposure,"Thermal barrier coating (TBC) is a critical material in the aerospace domain to increase the lifetime of gas turbine components subjected to thermal load. The properties of TBC are strongly related to the growth of thermally grown oxide (TGO) whose main constituent is Al2O3. However, the oxidation of Cr and Co can affect the growth of TGO, which is not studied sufficiently. In this paper, high-temperature exposure at 1000 °C was performed to investigate the effect of Cr and Co oxides on TGO growth. The morphology and composition analysis of the interface between the ceramic top coat and the bond coat (TC/BC) were investigated by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the energy dispersion spectrum (EDS). The thermodynamics and kinetics of oxidation were analyzed. The results indicated that the oxidation kinetics basically followed the sub-parabolic law with exposure time. Additionally, the major factor affecting the formation of oxides was the diffusion rate at the initial stage of exposure, then oxides depended on thermodynamics, and the oxidation was influenced by both of them in the last stage. The major elements to be oxidized were different at different stages. Moreover, the replacement reaction of Cr2O3 and the phase conversion of Al2O3 resulted in thickness variations of the TGO and Al-depleted zone during high-temperature exposure.","Zhang, Weifang; Zhang, Jingyu; Wang, Hongxun; Lou, Weitao; Liu, Xiaopeng",2018,Coatings,thermal barrier coating (TBC); high-temperature exposure; thermally grown oxide (TGO); Cr oxide; oxidation kinetics,10.3390/coatings8050195,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings8050195
Two-Body and Three-Body Wear Behavior of a Dental Fluorapatite Glass-Ceramic,"As a veneering porcelain coating of dental prosthesis, two-body and three-body wear behavior of dental glass-ceramic with the main crystalline phase of fluorapatite has not been comprehensively studied. In this work, a self-made fluorapatite glass-ceramic was synthesized and the mechanical and tribological performances of the glass-ceramic were tested, comparing with a commercial feldspathic glass-ceramic. The friction and wear experiments were performed between disk-shaped glass-ceramics and natural teeth in two-body (dry, water, saliva) and three-body (slurry) modes, respectively. Results showed that good mechanical properties of fluorapatite glass-ceramic can be achieved by the sintering process. In both two-body and three-body modes, the fluorapatite glass-ceramic had a smaller friction coefficient and wear rate and caused less damage on antagonistic teeth than the feldspathic glass-ceramic. The greater mechanical properties give fluorapatite glass-ceramic a better wear resistance and reduce the adhesive wear.","Wang, Gaoqi; Li, Yunkai; Wang, Shouren; Yang, Xuefeng; Sun, Yujing",2019,Coatings,glass-ceramic; veneering porcelain coating; friction and wear; three-body,10.3390/coatings9090580,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings9090580
Key Problems Affecting the Anti-Erosion Coating Performance of Aero-Engine Compressor: A Review,"Sand erosion has always been a key threat to the performance and service life of aero-engines. The compressor, the key component installed at the front of the aero-engine, suffers the most from sand erosion, especially compressors serving in deserts. Ceramic hard coating is a traditional way to improve the hardness and wear resistance of cutting and grinding tools. It may also be used to improve the erosion resistance of aero- engine compressor. However, the mechanism of erosion damage is complicated, which may include wear, secondary erosion, anisotropic erosion, impact, and fatigue. Recent research discovered the major problems with ceramic hard coating on aero-engine compressors. In this paper, these following problems are discussed: the design of coating material and structure, the preparation method and technology, the effects of droplets and clusters of coating surface, microstructure and characteristics of interface. The review of the major problems and possible solutions discussed in this paper may contribute to the future research on erosion coating theoretically and practically.","He, Guangyu; Sun, Danyang; Chen, Jiao; Han, Xiao; Zhang, Zhaolu; Fang, Zhihao; Yang, Lingwei; Yang, Zhufang",2019,Coatings,sand erosion; coating; structure design; damage modes; surface and interface,10.3390/coatings9120821,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings9120821
YAlO3—A Novel Environmental Barrier Coating for Al2O3/Al2O3–Ceramic Matrix Composites,"Ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) are promising materials for high-temperature applications. Environmental barrier coatings (EBCs) are needed to protect the components against water vapor attack. A new potential EBC material, YAlO3, was studied in this paper. Different plasma-spraying techniques were used for the production of coatings on an alumina-based CMC, such as atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) and very low pressure plasma spraying (VLPPS). No bond coats or surface treatments were applied. The performance was tested by pull–adhesion tests, burner rig tests, and calcium-magnesium-aluminum-silicate (CMAS) corrosion tests. The samples were subsequently analyzed by means of X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Special attention was paid to the interaction at the interface between coating and substrate. The results show that fully crystalline and good adherent YAlO3 coatings can be produced without further substrate preparation such as surface pretreatment or bond coat application. The formation of a thin reaction layer between coating and substrate seems to promote adhesion.","Gatzen, Caren; Mack, Daniel E",2019,Coatings,atmospheric plasma spraying (APS); very low pressure plasma spraying (VLPPS); environmental barrier coating (EBC); YAlO3; yttrium aluminum perovskite (YAP); ceramic matrix composite (CMC); Al2O3,10.3390/coatings9100609,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings9100609
The Effects of the Addition of Ti3SiC2 on the Microstructure and Properties of Laser Cladding Composite Coatings,"This study explored the effects of Ti3SiC2 on the microstructure and properties of laser cladding coatings using X-ray diffractometer, scanning electron microscope, electrochemical workstation, and UMT-2 wear tester analyses. It was found that with the addition of Ti3SiC2, the reinforcing phases in the composite coating were TiC, Ti(B,C)2, honeycomb-like (Cr, Fe)23C6, and a novel composite ceramic with an “eyeball” structure, which had an inside core of Al2O3 and TiC outer surrounding structure. The microhardness, wear, and corrosion resistance of the composite coating were about 1.35, 2, and 4.3 times those of the original coating, respectively. The main wear mechanisms of the original coating were severe fatigue spalling and microcutting, while the main mechanisms of the composite coating were slight microcutting and the formation of the transferred film.","Shi, Qin; Zhu, Hejun; Li, Changsheng",2020,Coatings,Ti3SiC2; composite ceramics; wear and corrosion resistance,10.3390/coatings10050498,https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings10050498
